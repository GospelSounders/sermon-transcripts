I plead in Jesus name. [Music] God is good and all the time. Uh we thank God so much for this wonderful morning he has given us. Thank you. We thank God for this morning he has given us that we may study his word together. And I also thank the teacher that have just passed and for the lesson of through education that have just passed and how God blessed him. And that's why I've chosen to songs uh to sing song number 523 that we need no any other evidence. We need no any other plea. It is enough that Jesus has died for us. Also mean in this my lesson I want to try to explain that by the end of it we may think that we need no other evidence. We need no any other play. It is enough that Jesus had died for us. Praise God. On the last lesson, where did we look on the last lesson? Yes. On the last lesson, we were looking for the bath of remnant church and we also tried to look about the pioneers history and the stories about the pioneers. And without wasting a lot of time when we were giving the the course outline that we will come to discover when I was looking for the lesson which I'm remaining with I try to uh I look and I become perplexed that I only have only one lesson before me and two the last topic which I gave the alpha and the apostasy will take much of my time and I've not looked it. So you just bear with me. I will try to go fast because I know seventh adventist are wise men and women you have brain. So even if I I'm going to go fast you you will just bear with me because time uh today we want to look on this topic of church heritage. You want to look on the subtopic which is called organization development and fall. Please organization development and organization development and form. So when we're looking for the history of the seventh adventist church, when we're looking on the division among the seventh adventist church, we determine that from the year 1844 the passing of time in the October 22nd many people were discouraged and the milite movement was divided into split of groups into atoms of organization. The first we find that there was an organization called the spiritualist. The second we look for the first day Adventist. The third we look also for the evangelical Adventist. And the fourth one will look for the sabotarian Adventist. The Adventists who are obeying the Sabbath day and also doing what? Waging for the second advent of Christ. And we come and realize also that after the passing of time man God is using a man called him and he's giving the vision of what has happened in the year on October 22nd 1844 and when they come together with pioneers like James White Joseph Bates and Ellen White they try to investigate what happened in the year 1844 and there we are finding the birth of the remnant So I want to jump very quickly up to the year 1860 up to the year60 on organization development and the form. Praise God. You can write organization development and the form. When we read the year 1860, there's something remarkable that happened that in the year 1860, 7th Adventist was given the name Seventh Adventist given to Sabatarian Adventist. You know, you know the history of the seventh adventist church or the Sabarian reaching the year 1816, they were given the name 7th day Adventist. When you read the book of one 4 to4 paragraph number one is saying that having voted to adopt a name the discussion now turned on what that name should be the name church of God was proposed and zealously advocated by some praise God is the name church of god wrong is it a sweet name the seabarian was saying hey we can call oursel what church of god it was objected that the name was already used by some denomination and on this account was indefinite beside having to the world an appearance of presumptions. Do we have churches called the church of God? Voice of salvation and healing church of God. What what what church of God? What what church of God? We have a lot of people called the church of God. But how many people see Adventist and the other one we share the name Seventh Day Adventist. We want to look why. Then I continue the name seventh adventist was proposed as a simple name and an expressive of our faith and position. Then the resolution come that we take the name Seventh Adventist. So in the year 1860, Sabatarian Adventist change their name to be seventh day adventist and seventh adventist have a meaning because when we read the book of 1 Samuel is 25:25 it is it is number as his name it means that our name is our character. Let me proceed. This resolution was discussed freely and the wording was adjusted to that we call ourselves seventh adventist. It was finally acted upon even though TJ Battle and Elder Lawrence Spar Andrews and Iraham refrained from voting. People did not agree with that name. But Ellen White was given a vision that this is the name that you ought to call yourself. It means that when we are in this place we are seventh day Adventist. Praise God. What is our name? We call ourselves seventh adventist. Why? Because this name is the name the Lord has given us. Let proceed. One of four paragraph number one. You're right. It say why do we take the name Seventh Day Adventist? A question worth to be considered. Why do we take the name Seven Seventh Day Adventist? Why did we not take disciples? And it is a good name. Why did we not take Christians? Why do we call did we not call ourselves the church of God? It is a question that people are asking themselves. The question, who are these people known as Seventh Day Adventist? Who are you? And what is the work they are trying to do are being asked more and more among the people of our land as our cause is coming more prominently before them. Why do we take the name Seventh Adventist? People are inquiring that why do we take the name Seventh Day Adventist Church? You can write it's the book called SD AWK 7th Day Adventist and their work. SD AWK written by Smith. It's saying this is our answer that we should give to the world. This name is assumed by us for only two reason. The number one reason is to distinguish us from other organized Christian bodies and another is to show the nature of our work. That is the first reason why we take the name seventh adventist. It means that God has made us to be a peculiar people. We are to be distinguished from the world to call ourselves disciples, Christians, church of God or or by many other names that might be mentioned. I know you can call yourself the remnant. You can call yourselves young evangelist. No, but our name is Seventh Day Adventist Church. You can call yourself what the last testimony, what anything. But we know that our name is Seventh Adventist Church or by any other name that might be mentioned will be of no account because such a name will not distinguish us from others who have the same name. Reason number two why we have adopted the name Seth Adventist is that the name we have taken indicates that we have enlisted in a work which we understand from scriptures. Do you understand your work? It means that before calling yourself sevenist you have to determine and understand the work that the Lord has called you. The name was have been taken to indicate that we have been elixed in a work which we understand from the scriptures is to be done in the present generation having for it chief's characteristic the keeping of the same there as the Sabbath and a belief in and promalgation of the doctrine of the second uh second person coming of Jesus Christ as now at the dawn. Praise God. We are in a work that we understand. Secondly, it is that we keep the seventh day seventh day Sabbath and we call people that Christ is the soon and immen and Christ is ready. Christ is coming in a short while. That is why we take the name Sim Baptist and I want to show you that we are not ashamed of our name. Let you not be ashamed of our of your name. to SMP 384 paragraph number one. Let me tell you it say that we are seventh adventist. Are we ashamed of our name? Are we ashamed of our name? We answer no. No, we are not ashamed. It is the name the Lord has given us. It points out the the truth that is to be the test of the churches. Even before us presenting the truth of the three angels messages y our name is distinguishing us and it is showing our work. We are seventh adventist and of this name we are never to be ashamed. As a people we must take a firm stand for the truth and righteousness. Thus we shall glorify God. We are to be delivered from dangers, not ens snared and corrupted by them. That this may be, we must look ever to Jesus the author and finish our faith. That is 2384. The paragraph is number two. We are not to be ashamed of our name because this name is the name the Lord has given us. In one B we have read that God is the one who given us this name. We are never to be ashamed of our name. We are never to be ashamed of our name. That is the year 1860. We given the name seventh adventist. That is the organization development. The seventh adventist is developing. Having adopted the name in the year 1816. Now they come in the year 1861 that they may unite themselves and fast in it is the year 1860 that now the Mexican conference is being organized. The Michigan conference is being organized in the year 1860. After adopting the name they say it was resolved that we recommend to the churches in the state of Michigan to unite in one conference with the name of the Michigan Conference of 7th day adventist. Are you understanding me? It mean that before the organization of the general conference first they must organize also the state conference. Do you know what a state conference is? It is like so region conference conference before them organizing themsel as a name seventh adventist general conference of seventh adventist state conference first organized themselves and after the organization of the state conference they send their delegates and go and organize their body as general conference. Not all church are carried by bus to go and organize themsel as a general conference. No, they send their delegates and they go and organize in one body of general conference. So when Michigan conference was organized, you're finding that the resolution was quickly adopted. Then the ministers and delegates from the churches were declared members of Michigan conference. Appropriate officers and conference committee were elected. So in the year 1861 when Michigan conference was organized, the chairman was Joseph base and the club was similar of the current year that is in the year 184042. So Joseph Bates and Smith they were elected as the member or as the organizers executive committee of the Michigan conference. Let me run quickly now. They come in the year 1863 and they say that state conference can organize but we are still confused. There are another conferences in different places. So what should we do for them to attain an perfect organization? They must go now to organize as a general body. Now they come in the year 1863. In the year is May 1863, the organization of General Conference of 7th Day Adventist. In the year 1863, it say for the purpose of securing unity and efficiency in labor, the promoting that is in the book of 480. It is 480. For the purpose of securing unity and efficiency in labor, the promoting of general entrance of the cause of present truth, and of perfecting the organization of 7th Day Adventist, we the delegates from several state conferences hereby proceed to organize a general conference. Praise God. So what are being sent to organize a general conference? delegates from state conference or delegates from regional conference. Now they for them to secure perfect unity they must also be in a general body. There were nine articles in the constitution specifying the name general conference of 7th day adventist. Three offices were called. Number one, the first office which was called is president. Number two, we have the secretary and number three we have the treasurer. Those are the exh those are the those are the offices which were elected and beside that there were also an executive committee of three. Are you getting me? The executive committee of three as organization was developing the executive committee developed from three to five to 9 to 13 to 17 and to 25. It continue an election of officers and executive committee was the next business. So the nominating committee went and elect and they bring their report for the ratification that it may be ratified. So this was their report. The committee of uh of nomination reported as follow. The president with the nomination committee elected was James White. The secretary was SA Smith and the treasurer was ES Wala and we have also the executive committee of what of three. When first organization was being chosed, the executive committee could consist of three people and and one of them being who the pre president. So it was this was the the what the report that they brought on motion the conference proceed to vote on nomination presented. Brother Wy was anominously chosen president but declined to serve. Why? Why did brother White decline to serve? Who can explain in five sentence? H five words. Yes, brother Felix. Thank you. Because you are being told that brother White was the one pressing what organization then he was anonymously elected and to remove the idea that he was not what fighting over over job. He say that let me alone first. After after considerable time spent in discussion they discuss that brother why don't you take this what this seat we see no one can take it the brethren urging reason why you should accept the position they have the reason and solid reason and and why he should not also brother white stood and say that I should not I don't want this position because this and this this resignation was finally accepted and Elder John Bington elected as president in his state. So it is now uh so it so the president was John Bington the secretary Rasmid and the treasurer who escal the nomination for secretary and treasurer was then ratified JN Andrews and GW Amadon were chosen as the remaining members of the executive [Music] committee. So you can write that the first president of the general conference would John Bington. Let us general conference presidents of 7th day Adventist. Number one we have John Bington. He worked from the May 1863 to May 1865. The the conference moved into its work in organizing the general conference of 7th day Adventist as noted elsewhere that I'm in the book of one bio 479 for to 481 the general conference move into the work in organizing the general conference of 7th year adventies as noted elsewhere the conference elected John Bington as president Smith as secretary es wala treasurer Uh James White was firstly uh first unanimously elected to the presidency but he thought it is best to let another carry that responsibility. Bington will be joined by JN Anderson and GW Amadon making the executive committee of three. So the first president of 7th Adventist working from the year 1863 to 1865 is who? John Bington. Coming to the general conference or annual session of 1865, we are finding the second president who is now James White. James White, the second president now of 7th Day Adventist. He worked from the year May 1865 to May 1867. The committee of nomination brought in in a report recommending officers for the coming year for President James White, secretary Uriah Smith, treasurer ID van Horn. They were elected and a general conference committee was named made up of James White, JN Andrews and John Non lo. Are you writing this? That is in the year 1865. They also come again in the year 1865 annual meeting and James White was again reelected. It is the same post they reelected samely. They worked samely. The nomination committee recommended officers for the general conference for presidents James White, secretary Smith, treasurer I van Horn plus an executive committee an executive committee of white and lo that is two bio 116.6 and 21136 number one. So James White coming the second president of the 7th day Adventist church. The third one we are finding the third president is Jon Nevin Andrews working from the May 1867 to May 18 69. You can read on two bio 173 paragraph number one that John Nevin Andrew was elected president of general conference Smith secretary and ID van horn treasurer John Neio 271.6 She said that John Nevis Andrew who had served for two years as president of general conference of 7th day Adventist that is the third president. The fourth president it is James White again but the fourth president is James White. This is now the second term James White second term. The fourth President James White who worked from May 186169 to December 1871. AT69 general conference session says that the nominating committee was brought into the following recommendation for the offices offices and general conference committee for a president was elected James White secretary Ras Smith and treasurer ES Wala and executive committee of James White John Nevis Andrew and J Wagon coming the fourth president of seventh adventist we are finding a man called George Butler elected from May December 1871 to August 1874. That is number five. Number five. Then comes number six again. Who is elected once more? The sixth one. I'm in the fifth or the sixth. The sixth. Now come who? Once again. So this is now the last time James White is finishing his work and now he's dying in the year 1881. James White worked from August 1872 to October 1880. How many years? 6 years. But when we combine the years that James White have worked being told of James White was the president of general conference session in in 10 years. When you combine those years, how many years are they? 10. In how many terms? theta terms. So you can write from the year 1865 to 1867. You also work 1869 to 1871. You also work 1874 to 1818. You can write that read that on Adventist pioneer biography and pictures page number 24 and the paragraph is paragraph number three. after start working then George Butler Texas once again in October 1880 up to October 1888 8 years elderlas now it is the the second term of elabler is working in a combination of 11 years in 11 what years that is now Elder Batler. George Butler. Have you wrote? Have you right? Yes. We have You are going to another one. Another president of the Seventh Adventist whom you can know is Olen A. Olen working from October October 1888. It is just an October 1888 to February 18 97. Love comes another another president who is called George I George Owen working from February 1897 to April 1901. From now April 1901 to May 1922 we are finding also someone who is called Arthur G Daniel ag Daniels. Then there are another one. Then I run to my friend Nelie Wilson. Do you know Nelie Wilson? The father of four. Thank you. The father of Ted Wilson. So those are the uh general conference presidents that we can note in the development of the seventh day adventist. You cannot you can go and do your your research on your research on betweenness the presidents that you can find but them that can be noted as the pioneers of Adventist we are finding is the ones that have tried to I have tried to note I should go to another slide [Music] He served for a lot of years, not all the years, but there's a time that I he was keen on writing what on writing letters and writing reports and bookkeeping. He he really sufferable. It is more than now 20 years. It is more than even 30 years. He really served and you when you go and read about the history of Rasm we are finding he was also good in writing editing and he was also because he was also what he could not be the president of the general conference because he was on the leg what leg feet. Yes, I that's why he could not serve as the general conference president because he lo what his land. So he could not move from this place to this place. That's why he was faithful in his work but he only serve as the secretary. So we now go because we looked that in the year 1860 we were given a name and for us to be given a name also we have to be given a sign to point that our name to also the demonstrate the nature of our work. What is the t [Music] Yes. The nature of our work. So we are going for our sign of the seventh adventist. you will allow me to go like this because I only want have one lesson before me but you can go and do your research. So the question what to be considered is what is our sign or our banner? We should be known by two things the nature of our work our character and the work we have been instructed to do which it is being pointed by our name. The also message that we bear as seventh day adventist. It is being pointed by our sign. So Psalm 60 verse number four here the words of the lord is saying that thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth that God has instructed to this church a banner. And when this banner is being displayed, it is being be displayed because of the truth. The Lord has given us. Psalms 20 verse number four verse number 5. We say that we will rejoice in the name of the uh we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our God we will set us set up our banner. The Lord fulfill all thy petition. It means that because of the truth that we bear in the name of our of the Lord our God, we will come and set up our banner. So now comes that God give us a banner into 384 paragraph number three that the banner of the third angels has incribed upon the commandment of God and the faith of Jesus. Our institution have taken a name which set forth the character of our faith and of this name we are never to be ashamed. Praise God. I have been shown that this name means much and in adopting it we follow the light given us from heaven. It means that God has given us the banner of the three angels. What messages that is our banner that we were given by God. In the name of our Lord, we will set up our banner. Let's go. So question and question now you should consider and asked yourself when you look for the seventh adventures calling themselves general conference which has president which was established in the foundation. Question you should consider what happened to this logo then why this? What happened to this logo? Then why this? Let this question linger in your mind that what happened to this logo? Then why this? When we are looking on the history of the seventh day Adventist, we we come to realize that the history of the ancient Israel is a striking illustration of the past experience of the advent body. God led his people in the advent body even as he led the children of Israel from Egypt. It means that when there was a change in seventh adventist, it means that also Israel must have been this change. And for us to establish that that seventh adventist which called themselves so they are not the church of God. We also have to go and look for the earlier seventh adventist in the biblical context. Praise God. So there's something I really love in Deuteronomy 31 verse number 26 that now open your Bible. Deuteronomy 31 verse number 24 25 and 26 it says and it came to pass when Moses had made the end of the writing the words of this law in the book until they were finished that Moses commanded the le which bear the ark of the covenant said take this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God that it may be there for a witness against thee. So we are finding that when Moses had made the end of the writing and if you could have time I know you can go and investigate for yourself. We find we try in GC we come and realize that the history of the ancient Israel is also the history of the seventh seventh day adventist. It mean that if the ancient Israelites had a prophet also the seventh adventist must have a pro a prophets. That's why Isaiah 12:3 he said that by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt and by a prophet they were preserved. Also it means that by a prophet we were brought out of the world and also by a prophet we are going to be preserved and who is the prophet that has been extracted to this church. That's why also Israelites given the law of Moses and also given the commandment of God. Also this church is being given the law of God which is the scriptures and the spirit of prophecy. Linda messages 33 paragraph 4 is saying that the law of God and the spirit of prophecy go hand in hand to guide and cancel the church. And whenever the church has recognized this by obeying his law, the spirit of prophecy has been sent to guide her in the way of the truth. So the law of God, biblical Bible and the spirit of prophecy, they go hand in hand in guiding the church of God. So the question, what happened? What happened? The question is what happened to this logo and then why this? After the passing of bion the last pioneers in the year 1922 John not lo there comes now things started to change in seventh adventics that's why judges 2 verse number 10 say the question you can see on the screen that from the b of the three angels messages of the seventh adventist to the the three wavy lines and the cross in its m east. what happened the thing that have happened to us that's why this church have taken his time to explain the two education messages because of judges 2 verse number 10 that happened in the ancient Israelites saying and also all that generation the pioneers the last one dying in the year 19:22 all this generation gathered unto their fathers and there arose another gen another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. After the pioneers passed, there arose another another what another body. There was another people which knew not God. All the things that he had done yet done. They knew not God. It means that now the trinity god must do what? The trinity god must happen. So now see the prediction of apostasy in that judges 31 verse number 26 to 29. You see the parallel of Moses and Ellen White when they are predicted what is going to happen in seventh adventism. Look and read with me kingly. See this predicted apostasy. Last warning of Moses before death. These are the last warning that Moses is giving to the church before death that take this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark of covenant of the Lord your God that it may be for a witness against thee. For I know thy rebellion and thy stiffness. Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the Lord. And how much more after my death? Moses is saying that when I am with you now, you are following, you are going into apostasy. Then how after my death? Gather unto me all the elders of your tribe and your officers that I may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to records against them. Moses is making his last work. So consider chapter verse number 29. For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourself and know and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you and evil will befall you in the latter days because you will do evil in the sight of God to provoke him to anger through the work of your hand that after my death you will go into what? Apostasy. This is the prediction of who that take the Bible and the spirit of prophecy. They have to go hand in hand. I know that after my death rebellion will come. When I am still yet alive with thee, you have brought the what? The apostasy. What that thing happened in the seventh adventist before the death of Ellen White? There comes apostasy. Let me proceed. Now you write this book. 25 LTMS manuscript one of 1915 paragraph 2 start with paragraph 2 that see this predicted apostasy last warning of Moses before death also see this Ellen White last warning before death as was this this predicted apostasy M 25 MTMS manuscript one of 1950 15 paragraph 2 is saying that I tell you now that I when I am laid to rest great changes will take this the words of Moses for I know 27 for I know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck because behold while I am yet alive with you this day you have been rebellious against God and how much more after my death Now Ellen White is writing that I tell you now. This in the year 195. I tell you now that when I am laid to rest great changes will take place. I do not know when I shall be taken and I desire to warn you all against the devices of devil. I want the people to know that I warned them fully before my death. I warned you fully before my death. The is saying that I warn you fully before my death. I do not know especially what changes will take place but they should watch every conceivable sin that Satan will try to immortalize. I do not know when I will be late to rest but when I'm late to rest great changes will take place. That's why is writing in one page 204 paragraph number two. Write and read with me kindly line upon line. It say that the enemy of the soul has sought to bring in the supposition that a great reformation will take place among the seventh adventist. The enemy of the soul who is the devil. He has sought to bring suppososition that a great reformation was to take place among the seventh day Adventist and that this reformation will consist in giving up the doctrine we stand as the pillars of our faith and engaging in the process of reorganization. It mean that seventh adventist it reach a point that they must be reorganized. They must give their doctrines and they fulfill the prophecy. So question what this reformation to take place what will result? So you should write if reformation which was predicted by Moses and Ellen White will take place what will result? Number two number one what will result? The principle of truth that God in his wisdom has given to the remnant church will be discarded. That is number one. What this reformation to take place, what will result? Number one, the principle of truth that God is in his wisdom has given to the remnant church will be discarded. The medicine was medicine school sold. Did it enter apostasy? Was our publishing house sold? Was our sanitarium sold? Number two, our religion will be changed. Number three, the fundamental principles that have sustained the work for the last 50 years will be discarded as error. It means that our truth was going to be discarded as error. Number four, a new organization will be established. Which organization was established? General Conference of 7th Day Adventist Church. It means that they must establish another organization with different name with different banner with different teachings. Numbers of new order will be written. Those are the four things that happened. Five things. So now look, books of new orders was written. Number four book was which was written is living temple. I just noted because I don't know if Friday I will find time to speak about the alpha and omega of apostasy but you can go and investigate if I will not talk about the alpha and omega of apostasy that the book living temple which contain pantheism the teaching of the pantheism which is the strength the personality of the father and the son number two book which was written it question on doctrine that is now the the living temple is the alpha of apostasy and question of doctrine is the omega of the apostasy. Number four book which is the movement of destiny written by Leroy Fume and also the coming of the comforter written by Leroy F and defending the god which is written by Vance farm who have read the defending defending godhead. Have you seen that book? Those are the books of new god. You cannot s but books of new order will be written. Number two, we find that the fundamental principles that have sustained the work for the last 50 years will be discarded as error. How were they discarded? Can you look that timeline? In the year 1872, it was the declaration of the fundamental principle of 7th day Adventist. Reaching the year 1874, the 1872 fundamental principles were published. One was published by James White in science of times. You can go and look in the blue estate. It is there. The second one was was published by Smith in a publishing house called review and herald. Reaching the year 1889, fundamental principle was expanded to 28 without the trinity doctrine. Now come the year 1915. The old seventh adventist have been started to be changed. The doctrine has been started to be changed. Now they come out to the year 1931. Now the yearbooks here book the yearbook with new beliefs. Now it is published. Having the trinity doctrine at the second fundamental principle the third if reformation will take place what will result our religion will be changed and a new organization will be formed let me question what to be considered I'm asking you a question and prepare me answer me quickly how can I change the bu a Buddhist or Islam to be a Christian. How can I change a Buddhist or an Islam to be a Christian? Yes. I'm changing Buddha and I'm changing Allah and bringing to them to the knowledge of the one true God. How can I change old DA church to be Catholics? Changing one true God and bringing up who? The Trinity God. Is it simple like that? For me to change Buddha, Buddhist to be to be Christian, I change Buddha. For me to change Islam, now I change Allah and they come and worship the one true God. It means that our religion will be changed. Seventh Adventist was changed when they accepted what the Trinity doctrine. So now read the words of Nelie Wilson. The year 1981, LC Wilson, General Conference president, announced that the church has officially adopted the Trinity Doctrine, which is now number two in the church 28 fundamental beliefs. Not now they are not principle, but they are now beliefs. Pastor Nell Wilson while president of general conference of seventh adventist. He declares before the seventh adventist church that there is another universal and truly Catholic organization. The seventh day Adventist church. They are not now seventh adventist but they are another universal organization. Catholic church. Seventh 7th day Adventist. Our religion will be done what will be changed. It is also predicted in Bible that when they enter a new organization will be formed. Now there comes new 7th day Adventist. It is being predicted in the Psalm 74 verse number four. For them to change seventh adventist fooling. Psalm 74 verse number four. And I jump to verse number 8 9 10 and 11 is saying that thine enemy ro in thy midst. Who is the enemy? Satan. And white have predicted that the enemy of the soul sought to bring in supposition in the seventh adventist. So th enemies ro in the midst of their congregation. The enemy entered the seventh adventist. Then they set up their banners. They set up their sign. They verse number eight saying they said in their heart let us destroy them together. They have burnt up all the synagogues of the god in thy land. Then we as old seven elephantes now are crying that we see not our signs. There's no any other prophet among us. Elen wise has been stoned and killed among us any knoweth how long. And you will read Proverbs 28 28:19 or 29:18. Where there's no vision, people perish. Where the prophet, where there's no prophet, people are going to do what? To perish. So after the enemy have set up their sign, now comes in verse number 10. Oh God, how long shall the adversary approach? Shall the enemy blasphem thy name forever? Then we are being asked, God is withdrawing his hand. Why withdraw thou thy hand? Even thy right hand pluck it out of thy bosom. So it forces God to now withdraw his son from that 7day Catholic and God may raise up his church once more. The enemy entered the church. There come a communical movement in the church and see the commandment the command of God. The adversary has spread out his hand upon all thy pleasant things. For she had seen that the hidden entered into her sanctuary whom thou didest command that they should not enter into thy congregation. God commanded that the hidden seven advent should not do a chemical movement but the enemy try to do what? To get in. to get in. I don't just have a phone but in five of page 90 something that coming the 1860 what 1863 the executive committee 6 then three then what then 11 then 13 then 25 for to call theirselves gone. So see how our banner is being changed and how this religion is being formed on another religion. Then I just finish. Go with me. Ezekiel 8 verse number 14 to 16. He's saying then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord's house which was towards the north and behold there sat a woman weeping for tamuz. So it means that the church of God there come a point that they started to worship Damos. Consider verse 15 and 16. He's saying, \"Then said he unto me, hast thou seen this, oh son of man, turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abomination than you are seeing now?\" And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house. And behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, about five and 20 men with their backs towards the temple of the Lord, and their faces towards the east, and they worship the sons towards the east. So see what is being done in the church of God. They bring up taboos. Number one. Number two, they start worshiping the sun. The sun is worshiped in three ways. How can I put in English? When sun is arising, the midday and what? When sun is setting. So it is God the father, God the son and God the holy spirit. See we have three stages of sun and here is so they start worshiping the trinity god. When the sun is coming from this side on the middle, God the father, God the son and God the holy spirit. Beside worshiping the son, the trinity god, they also start to worship what? Tamuz. What does tamuz means in seventh day adventist? Go with me. HBS. HBS. HBS page 145.4. So you see cross Babylonian origin. He's saying that the same sign of the cross that Rome now worshiped was used in Babylonian mysteries. Read with me was applied by paganism to sign magic purposes was honored with the same honors. Then that which is now called the Christian cross was originally not Christian emblem at all but was the mystic tu of the chaldines and Egyptians. The true origin from the letter T the initial name of Tamuz. So where does the cross come from? The Chaldans and the Egyptians and the Babylonians. That's why the cross is letter T. Do you see that when it is to to really come apostate they must bring that cross into the church they must also worship the trinity god are you getting me that's why now when you term seventh advent now you find two people old seventh adventist and new 7th day adventist it is predicted by len white in 2 SMPP 385 paragraph number two he's saying that a company was presented before me under the name Seventh Day Adventist who were advising that the banner or sign which make us a distinct people should not be held. So strikingly they're saying that this banner really separate us from many denominations. Now they saying that the banner of the three angels we should not like that. Then they remove the banner when the adversary come in. Now the adversary set up is what? the banner, the banner of the devil. For they claim that it was not the best policy of securing sus institution. But this distinct banner is to be born through the world to the clause of probation. You read great controversy page 568 paragraph number two say that papies place crosses upon their judges upon their altars and upon their garments. also seventh adventist papers all Catholic seventh day Adventist place crosses upon their churches upon their altars and upon their sit that and the angel only they are wise seven is already wise people are placing using what unithood but they are placing using comp computers computer. But they are placing using what? Some are placing using the hoods. Everywhere seen the insignia of the cross. Everywhere it is outwardly honored and exalted by the teaching of Christ are buried beneath the mass of sens tradition, false interpretation and uh rigorous exaction. So, a question worth asking asking you as I finish. Do you look on the screen? A question worth asking. I'm asking you a question in the book of Psalms 11 verse number 13. I'm asking you a question. Psalms 11 verse number three. That if the foundation be destroyed, what can the Russians do? If the foundation had destroyed, what can the Russians do? Who can give me clear answer? If the foundation, if Steven has really been destroyed, what can the Russians do? Who can give me the answer? Felix. What can the Russians do? rebuilding the the answer is in the book of Isaiah 58:12. Question is, if the foundation be destroyed, what can the Russians do? Then he say, \"And they that shall be shall uh they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places. Thou shall raise up the foundation of many generation, and thou shalt be called the repairers of the bridge, the restorers of the path to dwell in.\" Praise God. So our work is to go to the old west places and do what? And rebuild because the command now come that we should not come out of the old landmarks. That's why God is saying in the book of Jeremiah 6 verse number 16 that thus says the Lord stand in the way. When we are being published like this what should we do? We stand in the way and see and ask for the old 7th day Adventist church and ask that where is the old seventh adventist doctrine and walk therein and we are going to find rest in the second advent of Christ. Now God is calling now God is calling us to restore and be old 7th day Adventist. That's why we are calling ourselves old what? Rebuilding the old foundation. The commandment came in proverbs 22:28 that remove not the ancient landmarks which thy fathers have said that is the command that came because Deuteronomy 32:7 in that ask thy fathers and they will shield thee. Proverbs 32:28 that remove not the ancient landmarks we thy fathers have set. Remove not the old landmarks and enter not in the fields of the fathers. God is calling us to the three angels message of 7th Adventist church. We are being called to restore our banner to become all seventh day Adventist. But when we are come to rebuild the whole foundation I want you to mark this point. Mark this point. We not are coming here. We are not coming with the mind of the world. But mark this point. 1 Corinthians 3 11. For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid than that is laid which is Jesus Christ. We are not laying any other foundation. We are not we are not doing anything but we are being called to rebel. To rebel. No any other foundation can we lay. We can start. know any other church than that which was laid by who? By Jesus Christ. But when we have come to what to lay the first lesson was the foundation of our work. We go to Ephesians 2 verse number 20. We say that are built upon the foundation of the apostle and the prophets. Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. And of the first lesson when we are rebuilding we are going first to Jesus who is the Bible and the scriptures. We are going to build also from the pioneers who is Ellen White writings and also we are going to the apostles who are the pio pioneers. Praise God. We are being called mark this point that we are being called to build upon the old foundation. I should learn my lesson at that point because my time is much spent. In the next lesson I will try so much to I should handle something on the I've tried to handle but I will try to finish my lesson on Friday. Is there anyone with a question then I pray then I give you chance. Thank you. Can you can you pray then I give you chance? Our father and God in heaven, thank you so much for this wonderful morning. Thank you for the word that thou have shared with us. I really plead before the cross that before the close of probation, may you help us to restore the old foundation and go back to the old seventh adventist and walk in the true principles of thine way. I really pray may you help that children who are making decision to stand within the ways of righteousness that they may not remove the old landmarks. Above all may thy will be done. I plead in Jesus name.",
        "timestamped_transcript": "[0.4s] Morning. Thank you for the first lesson.\n[2.9s] I pray that may also guide me how thou\n[5.9s] has guide thy son. We pray that let thy\n[9.0s] name be lifted in all things. I plead in\n[11.2s] Jesus name.\n[16.4s] [Music]\n[20.2s] God is good and all the\n[24.0s] time. Uh we thank God so much for this\n[26.8s] wonderful morning he has given us.\n[36.4s] Thank you. We thank God for this morning\n[38.3s] he has given us that we may study his\n[40.1s] word together. And I also thank the\n[42.9s] teacher that have just passed and for\n[44.6s] the lesson of through education that\n[46.6s] have just passed and how God blessed\n[49.4s] him. And that's why I've chosen to songs\n[52.1s] uh to sing song number\n[54.4s] 523 that we need no any other evidence.\n[57.4s] We need no any other plea. It is enough\n[60.2s] that Jesus has died for us. Also mean in\n[63.4s] this my lesson I want to try to explain\n[66.2s] that by the end of it we may think that\n[68.9s] we need no other evidence. We need no\n[71.7s] any other play. It is enough that Jesus\n[74.8s] had died for us. Praise\n[77.9s] God. On the last lesson, where did we\n[81.2s] look on the last\n[84.4s] lesson?\n[86.8s] Yes. On the last lesson, we were looking\n[89.1s] for the bath of remnant church and we\n[91.6s] also tried to look about the pioneers\n[93.6s] history and the stories about the\n[95.8s] pioneers. And without wasting a lot of\n[98.0s] time when we were giving the the course\n[100.3s] outline that we will come to discover\n[103.0s] when I was looking for the lesson which\n[105.0s] I'm remaining with I try to uh I look\n[108.6s] and I become perplexed that I only have\n[111.4s] only one lesson before me and two the\n[115.3s] last topic which I gave the alpha and\n[116.9s] the apostasy will take much of my time\n[120.0s] and I've not looked it. So you just bear\n[121.8s] with me. I will try to go fast because I\n[125.4s] know seventh adventist are wise men and\n[128.3s] women you have brain. So even if I I'm\n[132.0s] going to go fast you you will just bear\n[134.6s] with me because time uh today we want to\n[138.0s] look on this topic of church heritage.\n[140.5s] You want to look on the subtopic which\n[142.2s] is called organization development and\n[144.2s] fall. Please organization development\n[147.8s] and\n[152.9s] organization development and form. So\n[157.0s] when we're looking for the history of\n[158.3s] the seventh adventist church, when we're\n[160.8s] looking on the division among the\n[163.3s] seventh adventist church, we determine\n[165.6s] that from the year\n[167.5s] 1844 the passing of time in the October\n[170.4s] 22nd many people were discouraged and\n[173.4s] the milite movement was divided into\n[176.9s] split of groups into atoms of\n[180.0s] organization. The first we find that\n[182.1s] there was an organization called the\n[183.8s] spiritualist. The second we look for the\n[186.3s] first day Adventist. The third we look\n[189.0s] also for the evangelical Adventist. And\n[191.7s] the fourth one will look for the\n[193.0s] sabotarian Adventist. The Adventists who\n[195.8s] are obeying the Sabbath day and also\n[198.2s] doing what? Waging for the second advent\n[201.3s] of Christ. And we come and realize also\n[205.4s] that after the passing of time man God\n[208.2s] is using a man called\n[210.8s] him and he's giving the vision of what\n[214.2s] has happened in the year on October 22nd\n[217.5s] 1844 and when they come\n[220.8s] together with pioneers like James White\n[223.4s] Joseph Bates and Ellen White they try to\n[226.5s] investigate what happened in the year\n[228.4s] 1844 and there we are finding the birth\n[230.8s] of the remnant\n[232.6s] So I want to jump very quickly up to the\n[235.5s] year 1860 up to the year60 on\n[239.4s] organization development and the form.\n[242.3s] Praise God. You can write organization\n[244.8s] development and the form. When we read\n[246.7s] the year 1860, there's something\n[249.2s] remarkable that happened that in the\n[251.4s] year 1860, 7th Adventist was given the\n[255.5s] name Seventh Adventist given to\n[258.1s] Sabatarian\n[260.1s] Adventist. You know, you know the\n[261.8s] history of the seventh adventist church\n[263.5s] or the Sabarian reaching the year\n[266.9s] 1816, they were given the name 7th day\n[271.4s] Adventist. When you read the book of one\n[274.6s] 4 to4 paragraph number one is saying\n[276.4s] that having voted to adopt a name the\n[279.7s] discussion now turned on what that name\n[281.9s] should be the name church of God was\n[284.8s] proposed and zealously advocated by some\n[288.4s] praise God is the name church of god\n[291.2s] wrong is it a sweet name the seabarian\n[295.8s] was saying hey we can call oursel what\n[298.6s] church of god it was objected that the\n[301.8s] name was already used by some\n[303.7s] denomination and on this account was\n[306.9s] indefinite beside having to the world an\n[309.4s] appearance of\n[311.2s] presumptions. Do we have churches called\n[313.2s] the church of God? Voice of salvation\n[315.9s] and healing church of God. What what\n[318.3s] what church of God? What what church of\n[320.7s] God? We have a lot of people called the\n[322.8s] church of God. But how many\n[330.7s] people see Adventist and the other one\n[334.5s] we share the name Seventh Day\n[336.8s] Adventist. We want to look why. Then I\n[340.1s] continue the name seventh adventist was\n[342.2s] proposed as a simple name and an\n[345.0s] expressive of our faith and position.\n[347.4s] Then the resolution come that we take\n[349.2s] the name Seventh Adventist. So in the\n[351.8s] year\n[353.1s] 1860, Sabatarian Adventist change their\n[355.8s] name to be seventh day adventist and\n[358.5s] seventh adventist have a meaning because\n[361.1s] when we read the book of 1 Samuel is\n[364.0s] 25:25 it is it is number\n[368.2s] as his name it means that our name is\n[372.4s] our character. Let me proceed. This\n[375.8s] resolution was discussed freely and the\n[379.0s] wording was adjusted to that we call\n[382.6s] ourselves seventh adventist. It was\n[385.3s] finally acted upon even though TJ\n[390.7s] Battle and Elder\n[393.0s] Lawrence Spar Andrews and Iraham\n[396.8s] refrained from voting. People did not\n[399.7s] agree with that name. But Ellen White\n[402.3s] was given a vision that this is the name\n[404.6s] that you ought to call yourself. It\n[407.8s] means that when we are in this place we\n[410.2s] are seventh day Adventist. Praise God.\n[413.9s] What is our\n[416.0s] name? We call ourselves seventh\n[418.3s] adventist. Why? Because this name is the\n[420.9s] name the Lord has given us. Let\n[424.5s] proceed. One of four paragraph number\n[427.8s] one. You're right. It say why do we take\n[430.5s] the name Seventh Day Adventist? A\n[432.3s] question worth to be considered. Why do\n[436.2s] we take the name Seven Seventh Day\n[438.1s] Adventist? Why did we not take\n[440.2s] disciples? And it is a good name. Why\n[442.4s] did we not take Christians? Why do we\n[444.9s] call did we not call ourselves the\n[446.8s] church of God? It is a question that\n[449.2s] people are asking themselves. The\n[451.5s] question, who are these people known as\n[454.1s] Seventh Day Adventist? Who are you?\n[461.0s] And what is the work they are trying to\n[465.0s] do are being asked more and more among\n[468.2s] the people of our land as our cause is\n[471.0s] coming more prominently before them. Why\n[474.9s] do we take the name Seventh\n[477.5s] Adventist? People are inquiring that why\n[479.8s] do we take the name Seventh Day\n[480.9s] Adventist Church? You can write it's the\n[483.2s] book called SD\n[484.7s] AWK 7th Day Adventist and their work. SD\n[488.4s] AWK written by Smith. It's saying this\n[491.8s] is our answer that we should give to the\n[493.5s] world. This name is assumed by us for\n[496.6s] only two reason. The number one reason\n[500.0s] is to distinguish us from other\n[503.0s] organized Christian bodies and another\n[506.2s] is to show the nature of our work. That\n[509.9s] is the first reason why we take the name\n[513.0s] seventh adventist. It means that God has\n[515.8s] made us to be a peculiar people. We are\n[519.4s] to be distinguished from the world to\n[522.2s] call ourselves disciples, Christians,\n[525.4s] church of God or or by many other names\n[528.6s] that might be mentioned. I know you can\n[530.8s] call yourself the remnant. You can call\n[533.0s] yourselves young evangelist. No, but our\n[535.8s] name is Seventh Day Adventist Church.\n[539.4s] You can call yourself what the last\n[541.6s] testimony, what anything. But we know\n[544.5s] that our name is Seventh Adventist\n[548.0s] Church or by any other name that might\n[551.1s] be mentioned will be of no account\n[554.0s] because such a name will not distinguish\n[556.5s] us from others who have the same name.\n[560.9s] Reason number two why we have adopted\n[563.5s] the name Seth Adventist is that the name\n[567.1s] we have taken indicates that we have\n[570.0s] enlisted in a work which we understand\n[573.7s] from scriptures. Do you understand your\n[577.2s] work? It means that before calling\n[579.4s] yourself sevenist you have to determine\n[582.7s] and understand the work that the Lord\n[584.6s] has called\n[586.7s] you. The name was have been taken to\n[589.4s] indicate that we have been elixed in a\n[591.1s] work which we understand from the\n[593.4s] scriptures is to be done in the present\n[595.7s] generation having for it chief's\n[598.0s] characteristic the keeping of the same\n[600.3s] there as the Sabbath and a belief in and\n[604.3s] promalgation of the doctrine of the\n[606.7s] second uh second person coming of Jesus\n[611.1s] Christ as now at the dawn. Praise God.\n[616.5s] We are in a work that we understand.\n[618.6s] Secondly, it is that we keep the seventh\n[621.6s] day seventh day Sabbath and we call\n[624.1s] people that Christ is the soon and immen\n[626.3s] and Christ is ready. Christ is coming in\n[628.9s] a short\n[630.4s] while. That is why we take the name Sim\n[633.5s] Baptist and I want to show you that we\n[635.8s] are not ashamed of our\n[637.4s] name. Let you not be ashamed of our of\n[640.2s] your name.\n[642.8s] to SMP 384 paragraph number\n[646.2s] one. Let me tell you it say that we are\n[649.2s] seventh\n[650.5s] adventist. Are we ashamed of our name?\n[654.0s] Are we ashamed of our name? We answer\n[656.6s] no. No, we are not ashamed. It is the\n[660.2s] name the Lord has given us. It points\n[663.0s] out the the truth that is to be the test\n[667.1s] of the churches. Even before us\n[670.5s] presenting the truth of the three angels\n[675.7s] messages y our name is distinguishing us\n[679.4s] and it is showing our work. We are\n[683.8s] seventh adventist and of this name we\n[686.7s] are never to be ashamed. As a people we\n[690.8s] must take a firm stand for the truth and\n[693.1s] righteousness. Thus we shall glorify\n[695.3s] God. We are to be delivered from\n[697.5s] dangers, not ens snared and corrupted by\n[700.1s] them. That this may be, we must look\n[703.3s] ever to Jesus the author and finish our\n[706.4s] faith. That is\n[708.4s] 2384. The paragraph is number two. We\n[711.8s] are not to be ashamed of our name\n[713.8s] because this name is the name the Lord\n[715.8s] has given us. In one B we have read that\n[719.1s] God is the one who given us this name.\n[723.4s] We are never to be ashamed of our name.\n[727.7s] We are never to be ashamed of our name.\n[729.8s] That is the year\n[731.4s] 1860. We given the name seventh\n[733.8s] adventist. That is the organization\n[736.2s] development. The seventh adventist is\n[739.4s] developing. Having adopted the name in\n[741.8s] the year 1816. Now they come in the year\n[746.2s] 1861 that they may unite\n[749.1s] themselves and fast in it is the year\n[752.6s] 1860 that now the Mexican conference is\n[755.3s] being\n[757.6s] organized. The Michigan conference is\n[759.9s] being organized in the year\n[762.4s] 1860. After adopting the name they say\n[765.0s] it was resolved that we recommend to the\n[766.9s] churches in the state of Michigan to\n[769.2s] unite in one conference with the name of\n[771.1s] the Michigan Conference of 7th day\n[775.1s] adventist. Are you understanding me? It\n[778.2s] mean that before the organization of the\n[780.1s] general conference first they must\n[782.3s] organize also the state conference. Do\n[785.0s] you know what a state conference is? It\n[788.1s] is like so region\n[791.3s] conference conference before them\n[794.0s] organizing themsel as a name seventh\n[796.6s] adventist general conference of seventh\n[798.5s] adventist state conference first\n[800.5s] organized themselves and after the\n[802.6s] organization of the state conference\n[804.9s] they send their delegates and go and\n[807.8s] organize their body as general\n[811.1s] conference. Not all church are carried\n[813.4s] by bus to go and organize themsel as a\n[815.8s] general conference. No, they send their\n[818.8s] delegates and they go and organize in\n[821.4s] one body of general\n[823.0s] conference. So when Michigan conference\n[825.2s] was organized, you're finding that the\n[827.2s] resolution was quickly adopted. Then the\n[830.0s] ministers and delegates from the\n[831.7s] churches were declared members of\n[833.4s] Michigan conference. Appropriate\n[836.4s] officers and conference committee were\n[839.2s] elected. So in the year 1861 when\n[841.8s] Michigan conference was organized, the\n[844.1s] chairman was Joseph\n[846.4s] base and the club\n[848.9s] was\n[852.8s] similar of the current year that is in\n[856.2s] the year\n[858.8s] 184042. So Joseph Bates and Smith they\n[863.2s] were elected as the member or as the\n[866.8s] organizers executive committee of the\n[870.0s] Michigan conference. Let me run quickly\n[873.0s] now. They come in the year\n[874.6s] 1863 and they say that state conference\n[878.2s] can organize but we are still confused.\n[882.2s] There are another conferences in\n[884.3s] different places. So what should we do\n[887.6s] for them to attain an perfect\n[890.8s] organization? They must go now to\n[892.8s] organize as a general body. Now they\n[896.3s] come in the year 1863.\n[898.8s] In the year is May\n[901.0s] 1863, the organization of General\n[903.8s] Conference of 7th Day Adventist. In the\n[907.2s] year\n[909.3s] 1863, it say for the purpose of securing\n[913.2s] unity and efficiency in labor, the\n[915.9s] promoting that is in the book of\n[918.5s] 480. It is\n[920.7s] 480. For the purpose of securing unity\n[923.9s] and efficiency in labor, the promoting\n[926.6s] of general entrance of the cause of\n[929.4s] present truth, and of perfecting the\n[931.8s] organization of 7th Day Adventist, we\n[935.0s] the delegates from several state\n[937.6s] conferences hereby proceed to organize a\n[942.5s] general conference. Praise God. So what\n[945.8s] are being sent to organize a general\n[947.4s] conference?\n[949.8s] delegates from state conference or\n[952.8s] delegates from regional conference. Now\n[956.1s] they for them to\n[958.5s] secure perfect unity they must also be\n[963.2s] in a general\n[964.8s] body. There were nine articles in the\n[967.7s] constitution specifying the name general\n[970.4s] conference of 7th day adventist. Three\n[973.4s] offices were called. Number one, the\n[975.6s] first office which was called is\n[979.0s] president. Number two, we have the\n[981.0s] secretary and number three we have the\n[983.8s] treasurer. Those are the exh those are\n[986.9s] the those are the offices which were\n[990.0s] elected and beside that there were also\n[993.5s] an executive committee of\n[998.0s] three. Are you getting me? The executive\n[1001.5s] committee of three as organization was\n[1005.1s] developing the executive committee\n[1007.2s] developed from three to five to 9 to 13\n[1011.1s] to 17 and to\n[1013.3s] 25. It continue an election of officers\n[1016.9s] and executive committee was the next\n[1019.6s] business. So the nominating committee\n[1021.8s] went and elect and they bring their\n[1025.0s] report for the ratification that it may\n[1027.8s] be ratified. So this was their report.\n[1030.8s] The committee of uh of nomination\n[1033.7s] reported as follow. The president with\n[1036.1s] the nomination committee elected was\n[1037.7s] James White. The secretary was SA Smith\n[1042.0s] and the treasurer was ES Wala and we\n[1046.2s] have also the executive committee of\n[1047.8s] what of three. When first organization\n[1051.3s] was being chosed, the executive\n[1053.5s] committee could consist of three people\n[1055.2s] and and one of them being who the pre\n[1060.8s] president. So it was this was the the\n[1063.8s] what the report that they\n[1065.6s] brought on motion the conference proceed\n[1068.5s] to vote on nomination presented. Brother\n[1072.0s] Wy was anominously chosen president but\n[1075.4s] declined to serve. Why? Why did brother\n[1080.4s] White decline to serve? Who can explain\n[1083.4s] in five sentence? H five\n[1086.9s] words. Yes, brother Felix.\n[1095.9s] Thank you. Because you are being told\n[1097.4s] that brother White was the one pressing\n[1099.7s] what\n[1100.4s] organization then he was anonymously\n[1102.9s] elected and to remove the idea that he\n[1106.1s] was not what fighting\n[1108.0s] over over job. He say that let me alone\n[1112.7s] first. After after considerable time\n[1116.2s] spent in discussion they discuss that\n[1118.5s] brother why don't you take this what\n[1120.2s] this seat we see no one can take\n[1123.4s] it the brethren urging reason why you\n[1126.2s] should accept the position they have the\n[1128.7s] reason and solid\n[1131.1s] reason and and why he should not also\n[1134.8s] brother white stood and say that I\n[1136.5s] should not I don't want this position\n[1138.8s] because this and this this resignation\n[1141.2s] was finally accepted and Elder John\n[1143.9s] Bington elected as president in his\n[1146.7s] state.\n[1148.9s] So it is now uh so it so the president\n[1152.8s] was John Bington the secretary Rasmid\n[1157.0s] and the treasurer who\n[1159.3s] escal the nomination for secretary and\n[1162.8s] treasurer was then ratified JN Andrews\n[1165.9s] and GW Amadon were chosen as the\n[1169.2s] remaining members of the executive\n[1172.0s] [Music]\n[1173.3s] committee. So you can write that the\n[1175.5s] first president of the general\n[1177.0s] conference would John Bington. Let us\n[1181.4s] general conference presidents of 7th day\n[1185.2s] Adventist. Number one we have John\n[1188.6s] Bington. He worked from the May\n[1192.4s] 1863 to May 1865.\n[1197.4s] The the conference moved into its work\n[1200.1s] in organizing the general conference of\n[1202.2s] 7th day\n[1203.3s] Adventist as noted elsewhere that I'm in\n[1206.3s] the book of one bio\n[1208.9s] 479 for to\n[1211.5s] 481 the general conference move into the\n[1214.2s] work in organizing the general\n[1215.7s] conference of 7th year adventies as\n[1217.4s] noted\n[1218.3s] elsewhere the conference elected John\n[1220.8s] Bington as president Smith as secretary\n[1224.6s] es wala treasurer Uh James White was\n[1227.4s] firstly uh first unanimously elected to\n[1231.8s] the presidency but he thought it is best\n[1234.6s] to let another carry that\n[1236.4s] responsibility. Bington will be joined\n[1238.8s] by JN Anderson and GW Amadon making the\n[1242.2s] executive committee of three. So the\n[1245.5s] first president of 7th Adventist working\n[1247.6s] from the year 1863 to 1865 is who? John\n[1254.3s] Bington. Coming to the general\n[1256.4s] conference or annual session of 1865, we\n[1259.0s] are finding the second president who is\n[1261.9s] now James\n[1263.9s] White. James White, the second president\n[1267.5s] now of 7th Day\n[1269.7s] Adventist. He worked from the year May\n[1273.3s] 1865 to May 1867.\n[1277.8s] The committee of nomination brought in\n[1280.4s] in a report recommending officers for\n[1283.4s] the coming year for President James\n[1286.1s] White, secretary Uriah Smith, treasurer\n[1289.8s] ID van Horn. They were elected and a\n[1294.8s] general conference committee was named\n[1297.4s] made up of James White, JN Andrews and\n[1300.0s] John Non\n[1302.7s] lo. Are you writing\n[1307.4s] this? That is in the year 1865. They\n[1310.2s] also come again in the year 1865 annual\n[1312.4s] meeting and James White was again\n[1315.7s] reelected. It is the same post they\n[1317.9s] reelected samely. They worked samely.\n[1320.6s] The nomination committee recommended\n[1322.2s] officers for the general conference for\n[1323.8s] presidents James White, secretary Smith,\n[1327.2s] treasurer I van Horn plus an executive\n[1330.5s] committee an executive committee of\n[1332.8s] white and lo that is two bio 116.6 and\n[1340.1s] 21136 number one. So James White coming\n[1343.1s] the second president of the 7th day\n[1345.5s] Adventist church.\n[1348.2s] The third one we are finding the third\n[1349.8s] president is Jon Nevin\n[1352.6s] Andrews working from the May 1867 to May\n[1357.0s] 18 69.\n[1359.8s] You can read on two bio 173 paragraph\n[1362.7s] number one that John Nevin Andrew was\n[1365.7s] elected president of general conference\n[1368.7s] Smith secretary and ID van horn\n[1375.8s] treasurer John Neio 271.6 She said that\n[1380.2s] John Nevis Andrew who had served for two\n[1383.2s] years as president of general\n[1385.8s] conference of 7th day\n[1388.8s] Adventist that is the third president.\n[1391.7s] The fourth president it is James White\n[1396.1s] again but the fourth president is James\n[1400.0s] White. This is now the second term James\n[1402.9s] White second term. The fourth President\n[1405.6s] James White who worked from May\n[1408.9s] 186169 to December 1871.\n[1413.8s] AT69 general conference session says\n[1415.8s] that the nominating committee was\n[1417.5s] brought into the following\n[1418.7s] recommendation for the offices offices\n[1421.3s] and general conference committee for a\n[1423.8s] president was elected James White\n[1426.0s] secretary Ras Smith and treasurer ES\n[1429.0s] Wala and executive committee of James\n[1431.5s] White John Nevis Andrew and J\n[1438.1s] Wagon coming the fourth president of\n[1440.6s] seventh adventist we are finding a man\n[1442.8s] called George\n[1446.0s] Butler elected from May December 1871 to\n[1450.4s] August\n[1452.8s] 1874. That is number\n[1456.6s] five. Number five. Then comes number six\n[1460.8s] again. Who is elected once more? The\n[1463.4s] sixth\n[1465.2s] one. I'm in the fifth or the sixth. The\n[1468.6s] sixth. Now come who? Once again. So this\n[1472.2s] is now the last time James White is\n[1474.2s] finishing his work and now he's dying in\n[1476.6s] the year\n[1477.9s] 1881. James White worked from August\n[1480.6s] 1872 to October 1880. How many years? 6\n[1485.0s] years. But when we combine the years\n[1487.0s] that James White have worked being told\n[1489.4s] of James White was the president of\n[1491.0s] general conference session in in 10\n[1494.7s] years. When you combine those years, how\n[1497.0s] many years are they? 10. In how many\n[1499.4s] terms? theta terms. So you can write\n[1503.3s] from the year 1865 to 1867. You also\n[1506.5s] work 1869 to 1871. You also work 1874 to\n[1511.5s] 1818. You can write that read that on\n[1514.1s] Adventist pioneer biography and pictures\n[1516.8s] page number 24 and the paragraph is\n[1519.5s] paragraph number three. after start\n[1522.4s] working then George Butler Texas once\n[1525.3s] again in October\n[1527.4s] 1880 up to October\n[1531.0s] 1888 8 years elderlas now it is the the\n[1536.0s] second term of elabler is working in a\n[1538.9s] combination of\n[1540.8s] 11\n[1546.8s] years in 11 what years that is now\n[1552.7s] Elder\n[1554.6s] Batler. George Butler. Have you wrote?\n[1557.4s] Have you right? Yes. We have You are\n[1560.0s] going to another one. Another president\n[1562.3s] of the Seventh Adventist whom you can\n[1565.3s] know\n[1568.1s] is\n[1570.0s] Olen A. Olen working from\n[1576.0s] October October 1888. It is just an\n[1579.8s] October\n[1580.8s] 1888 to February 18\n[1585.3s] 97. Love comes another another president\n[1588.4s] who is called\n[1590.4s] George I\n[1594.5s] George Owen working from February\n[1597.1s] 1897 to April 1901.\n[1603.4s] From now April 1901 to May\n[1607.2s] 1922 we are finding also someone who is\n[1609.8s] called Arthur G Daniel\n[1612.5s] ag\n[1614.0s] Daniels. Then there are another\n[1616.7s] one. Then I run to my friend Nelie\n[1620.7s] Wilson. Do you know Nelie Wilson? The\n[1623.3s] father of\n[1624.4s] four. Thank you. The father of Ted\n[1627.6s] Wilson. So those are the\n[1631.4s] uh general conference presidents that we\n[1633.4s] can note in the development of the\n[1635.8s] seventh day\n[1638.0s] adventist. You cannot you can go and do\n[1640.6s] your your research on your research on\n[1644.0s] betweenness the presidents that you can\n[1646.6s] find but them that can be noted as the\n[1650.1s] pioneers of Adventist we are finding is\n[1653.4s] the ones that have tried to I have tried\n[1655.8s] to\n[1656.8s] note I should go to another slide\n[1660.3s] [Music]\n[1672.4s] He served for a lot of\n[1674.4s] years, not all the years, but there's a\n[1677.6s] time\n[1680.6s] that I he was keen on writing what on\n[1684.7s] writing letters and writing reports and\n[1686.7s] bookkeeping. He he really sufferable. It\n[1688.9s] is more than now 20\n[1691.8s] years. It is more than even 30 years. He\n[1694.5s] really served and you when you go and\n[1696.9s] read about the history of Rasm we are\n[1698.7s] finding he was also good in writing\n[1702.0s] editing and he was also because he was\n[1705.2s] also what he could not be the president\n[1707.2s] of the general conference because he\n[1711.1s] was on the leg what leg feet.\n[1717.9s] Yes, I that's why he could not serve as\n[1720.3s] the general conference president because\n[1723.0s] he lo what his land. So he could not\n[1725.8s] move from this place to this place.\n[1727.8s] That's why he was faithful in his work\n[1729.9s] but he only serve as the\n[1732.0s] secretary. So we now go because we\n[1734.8s] looked that in the year 1860 we were\n[1737.1s] given a name and for us to be given a\n[1739.4s] name also we have to be given a sign to\n[1741.8s] point that our name to also the\n[1744.6s] demonstrate the nature of our work. What\n[1748.7s] is the t\n[1754.3s] [Music]\n[1756.5s] Yes. The nature of our work. So we are\n[1758.5s] going for our sign of the seventh\n[1760.3s] adventist. you will allow me to go like\n[1762.6s] this because I only want have one lesson\n[1765.1s] before me but you can go and do your\n[1767.5s] research. So the question what to be\n[1769.9s] considered is what is our sign or our\n[1772.8s] banner? We should be known by two things\n[1775.6s] the nature of our work our character and\n[1778.3s] the work we have been instructed to do\n[1780.2s] which it is being pointed by our name.\n[1782.8s] The also message that we bear as seventh\n[1785.4s] day adventist. It is being pointed by\n[1788.2s] our\n[1790.4s] sign. So Psalm 60 verse number four here\n[1794.3s] the words of the lord is saying that\n[1796.0s] thou hast given a banner to them that\n[1798.1s] fear thee that it may be displayed\n[1800.7s] because of the truth that God has\n[1804.2s] instructed to this church a banner. And\n[1807.0s] when this banner is being displayed, it\n[1809.4s] is being be displayed because of the\n[1811.0s] truth. The Lord has given\n[1813.7s] us. Psalms 20 verse number four verse\n[1816.5s] number 5. We say that we will rejoice in\n[1819.2s] the name of the uh we will rejoice in\n[1821.3s] thy salvation and in the name of our God\n[1824.1s] we will set us set up our banner. The\n[1828.4s] Lord fulfill all thy\n[1831.2s] petition. It means that because of the\n[1833.5s] truth that we bear in the name of our of\n[1836.3s] the Lord our God, we will come and set\n[1839.3s] up our\n[1841.6s] banner. So now comes that God give us a\n[1845.5s] banner into 384 paragraph number three\n[1849.6s] that the banner of the third angels has\n[1851.4s] incribed upon the commandment of God and\n[1854.2s] the faith of Jesus. Our institution have\n[1856.9s] taken a name which set forth the\n[1858.5s] character of our faith and of this name\n[1861.2s] we are never to be ashamed. Praise God.\n[1864.2s] I have been shown that this name means\n[1866.1s] much and in adopting it we follow the\n[1869.5s] light given us from heaven. It means\n[1872.6s] that God has given us the banner of the\n[1874.2s] three angels. What messages that is our\n[1877.4s] banner that we were given by God. In the\n[1881.3s] name of our Lord, we will set up our\n[1884.9s] banner. Let's go. So question and\n[1887.7s] question now you should consider and\n[1891.4s] asked yourself when you look for the\n[1894.2s] seventh adventures calling themselves\n[1895.8s] general conference which has president\n[1898.2s] which was established in the\n[1900.0s] foundation. Question you should consider\n[1902.3s] what happened to this logo then why\n[1906.4s] this? What happened to this logo? Then\n[1909.1s] why this? Let this question linger in\n[1912.5s] your mind that what happened to this\n[1914.6s] logo? Then why\n[1917.2s] this? When we are looking on the history\n[1919.8s] of the seventh day Adventist, we we come\n[1922.6s] to realize that the history of the\n[1924.2s] ancient Israel is a striking\n[1926.0s] illustration of the past experience of\n[1927.5s] the advent body. God led his people in\n[1930.6s] the advent body even as he led the\n[1932.6s] children of Israel from Egypt.\n[1936.5s] It means that when there was a change in\n[1938.6s] seventh adventist, it means that also\n[1940.2s] Israel must have been this change. And\n[1942.5s] for us to establish that that seventh\n[1944.6s] adventist which called themselves so\n[1946.7s] they are not the church of God. We also\n[1948.5s] have to go and look for the earlier\n[1950.4s] seventh adventist in the biblical\n[1953.8s] context. Praise God. So there's\n[1956.6s] something I really love in Deuteronomy\n[1958.6s] 31 verse number\n[1961.0s] 26 that now open your Bible. Deuteronomy\n[1964.8s] 31 verse number 24 25 and\n[1969.2s] 26 it says and it came to pass when\n[1972.7s] Moses had made the end of the\n[1975.4s] writing the words of this law in the\n[1978.0s] book until they were finished that Moses\n[1981.0s] commanded the le which bear the ark of\n[1983.0s] the covenant said take this book of the\n[1985.8s] law and put it in the side of the ark of\n[1988.6s] the covenant of the Lord your God that\n[1991.2s] it may be there for a witness against\n[1995.2s] thee. So we are finding that when Moses\n[1997.9s] had made the end of the writing and if\n[2000.0s] you could have time I know you can go\n[2001.7s] and investigate for yourself. We find we\n[2004.6s] try in GC we come and realize that the\n[2008.2s] history of the ancient Israel is also\n[2009.9s] the history of the seventh seventh day\n[2012.3s] adventist. It mean that\n[2014.8s] if the ancient Israelites had a prophet\n[2018.2s] also the seventh adventist must have a\n[2020.1s] pro a prophets. That's why Isaiah 12:3\n[2023.0s] he said that by a prophet the Lord\n[2025.4s] brought Israel out of Egypt and by a\n[2028.4s] prophet they were preserved. Also it\n[2031.8s] means that by a prophet we were brought\n[2034.6s] out of the world and also by a prophet\n[2037.4s] we are going to be\n[2040.3s] preserved and who is the prophet that\n[2042.5s] has been extracted to this church.\n[2046.5s] That's why also Israelites given the law\n[2049.1s] of Moses and also given the commandment\n[2051.2s] of God. Also this church is being given\n[2054.7s] the law of God which is the scriptures\n[2056.3s] and the spirit of prophecy. Linda\n[2059.1s] messages 33 paragraph 4 is saying that\n[2061.3s] the law of God and the spirit of\n[2063.3s] prophecy go hand in hand to guide and\n[2065.1s] cancel the church. And whenever the\n[2067.3s] church has recognized this by obeying\n[2069.3s] his law, the spirit of prophecy has been\n[2071.7s] sent to guide her in the way of the\n[2075.1s] truth.\n[2077.8s] So the law of God, biblical Bible and\n[2081.2s] the spirit of prophecy, they go hand in\n[2083.6s] hand in guiding the church of\n[2088.8s] God. So the question, what\n[2091.8s] happened? What\n[2094.9s] happened? The question is what happened\n[2098.2s] to this logo and then why\n[2102.4s] this? After the passing of bion the last\n[2105.4s] pioneers in the year 1922 John not lo\n[2110.3s] there comes now things started to change\n[2113.0s] in seventh adventics that's why judges 2\n[2116.6s] verse number 10 say the question you can\n[2120.1s] see on the screen that from the b of the\n[2123.1s] three angels messages of the seventh\n[2125.3s] adventist to the the three wavy lines\n[2129.3s] and the cross in its m east. what\n[2132.7s] happened the thing that have happened to\n[2135.4s] us that's why this church have taken his\n[2137.6s] time to explain the two education\n[2139.0s] messages because of judges 2 verse\n[2140.6s] number 10 that happened in the ancient\n[2142.8s] Israelites saying and also all that\n[2145.6s] generation the pioneers the last one\n[2148.1s] dying in the year 19:22 all this\n[2150.8s] generation gathered unto their fathers\n[2153.3s] and there arose another gen another\n[2156.3s] generation after them which knew not the\n[2159.1s] Lord nor yet the works\n[2162.6s] which he had done for\n[2165.0s] Israel. After the pioneers passed, there\n[2167.7s] arose another another what another body.\n[2170.5s] There was another people which knew not\n[2172.6s] God. All the things that he had done yet\n[2175.6s] done. They knew not God. It means that\n[2177.9s] now the trinity god must do what? The\n[2180.2s] trinity god must happen. So now see the\n[2184.7s] prediction of apostasy in that judges 31\n[2188.7s] verse number 26 to 29. You see the\n[2191.3s] parallel of Moses and Ellen White when\n[2193.4s] they are predicted what is going to\n[2195.1s] happen in seventh adventism. Look and\n[2197.4s] read with me kingly. See this predicted\n[2200.8s] apostasy. Last warning of Moses before\n[2204.0s] death. These are the last warning that\n[2206.2s] Moses is giving to the church before\n[2207.9s] death that take this book of the law and\n[2210.8s] put it in the side of the ark of\n[2212.6s] covenant of the Lord your God that it\n[2216.2s] may be for a witness against thee. For I\n[2219.9s] know thy rebellion and thy stiffness.\n[2223.5s] Behold, while I am yet alive with you\n[2227.1s] this day, you have been rebellious\n[2229.6s] against the Lord. And how much more\n[2232.0s] after my\n[2234.2s] death? Moses is saying that when I am\n[2236.7s] with you now, you are following, you are\n[2239.0s] going into apostasy. Then how after my\n[2242.2s] death?\n[2244.9s] Gather unto me all the elders of your\n[2247.2s] tribe and your officers that I may speak\n[2250.5s] these words in their ears and call\n[2252.6s] heaven and earth to records against\n[2255.0s] them. Moses is making his last work. So\n[2258.8s] consider chapter verse number 29. For I\n[2262.1s] know that after my death ye will utterly\n[2266.1s] corrupt yourself and know and turn aside\n[2270.2s] from the way which I have commanded you\n[2273.0s] and evil will befall you in the latter\n[2275.8s] days because you will do evil in the\n[2278.2s] sight of God to provoke him to anger\n[2280.7s] through the work of your hand that after\n[2283.9s] my death you will go into what?\n[2287.2s] Apostasy. This is the prediction of\n[2292.0s] who that take the Bible and the spirit\n[2295.2s] of prophecy. They have to go hand in\n[2297.8s] hand. I know that after my death\n[2301.0s] rebellion will come. When I am still yet\n[2303.4s] alive with thee, you have brought the\n[2304.7s] what? The apostasy. What that thing\n[2307.5s] happened in the seventh adventist before\n[2309.1s] the death of Ellen White? There comes\n[2314.0s] apostasy. Let me proceed. Now you write\n[2316.3s] this book.\n[2318.7s] 25 LTMS manuscript one of 1915 paragraph\n[2324.0s] 2 start with paragraph\n[2327.3s] 2 that see this predicted apostasy last\n[2330.5s] warning of Moses before death also see\n[2334.3s] this Ellen White last warning before\n[2336.3s] death as\n[2337.5s] was this this predicted\n[2341.2s] apostasy M 25 MTMS manuscript one of\n[2346.5s] 1950 15 paragraph 2 is saying that I\n[2349.3s] tell you now that I when I am laid to\n[2351.8s] rest great changes will\n[2357.3s] take this the words of\n[2359.6s] Moses for I know 27 for I know thy\n[2363.1s] rebellion and thy stiff neck because\n[2366.2s] behold while I am yet alive with you\n[2369.0s] this day you have been rebellious\n[2371.7s] against God and how much more after my\n[2375.4s] death Now Ellen White is writing that I\n[2378.1s] tell you now. This in the year\n[2380.8s] 195. I tell you now that when I am laid\n[2384.9s] to rest great changes will take place. I\n[2388.2s] do not know when I shall be taken and I\n[2391.2s] desire to warn you all against the\n[2392.9s] devices of devil. I want the people to\n[2395.7s] know that I warned them fully before my\n[2400.2s] death. I warned you fully before my\n[2402.8s] death. The is saying that I warn you\n[2404.9s] fully before my death. I do not know\n[2407.5s] especially what changes will take place\n[2409.8s] but they should watch every conceivable\n[2411.8s] sin that Satan will try to\n[2415.1s] immortalize. I do not know when I will\n[2417.3s] be late to rest but when I'm late to\n[2419.8s] rest great changes will take place.\n[2422.4s] That's why is writing in one page 204\n[2426.3s] paragraph number two. Write and read\n[2428.3s] with me kindly line upon\n[2431.2s] line. It say that the enemy of the soul\n[2433.9s] has sought to bring in the supposition\n[2436.2s] that a great reformation will take place\n[2438.6s] among the seventh\n[2441.3s] adventist. The enemy of the soul who is\n[2443.6s] the devil. He has sought to bring\n[2446.1s] suppososition that a great reformation\n[2448.6s] was to take place among the seventh day\n[2451.4s] Adventist and that this reformation will\n[2454.5s] consist in giving up the doctrine we\n[2457.8s] stand as the pillars of our faith and\n[2460.0s] engaging in the process of\n[2463.6s] reorganization. It mean that seventh\n[2465.6s] adventist it reach a point that they\n[2467.8s] must be\n[2468.9s] reorganized. They must give their\n[2472.0s] doctrines and they fulfill the\n[2475.0s] prophecy. So question what this\n[2477.7s] reformation to take place what will\n[2480.8s] result? So you should\n[2483.2s] write if reformation which was predicted\n[2485.8s] by Moses and Ellen White will take place\n[2487.8s] what will result? Number two number one\n[2490.9s] what will result? The principle of truth\n[2494.2s] that God in his wisdom has given to the\n[2496.6s] remnant church will be discarded. That\n[2499.3s] is number\n[2504.0s] one. What this reformation to take\n[2506.2s] place, what will result? Number one, the\n[2509.7s] principle of truth that God is in his\n[2512.9s] wisdom has given to the remnant church\n[2514.6s] will be\n[2516.7s] discarded. The medicine was medicine\n[2519.3s] school\n[2520.4s] sold. Did it enter\n[2522.9s] apostasy? Was our publishing house\n[2526.9s] sold? Was our sanitarium\n[2530.3s] sold? Number two, our religion will be\n[2535.7s] changed. Number three, the fundamental\n[2538.8s] principles that have sustained the work\n[2540.9s] for the last 50 years will be discarded\n[2543.0s] as error. It means that our truth was\n[2546.8s] going to be discarded as error. Number\n[2549.5s] four, a new organization will be\n[2552.7s] established. Which organization was\n[2554.6s] established? General Conference of 7th\n[2556.6s] Day Adventist Church. It means that they\n[2559.7s] must establish another organization with\n[2562.4s] different name with different banner\n[2565.0s] with different teachings.\n[2569.2s] Numbers of new order will be written.\n[2573.4s] Those are the four things that happened.\n[2575.8s] Five things. So now look, books of new\n[2579.6s] orders was written. Number four book was\n[2582.6s] which was written is living temple. I\n[2585.0s] just noted because I don't know if\n[2587.4s] Friday I will find time to speak about\n[2589.1s] the alpha and omega of apostasy but you\n[2591.8s] can go and investigate if I will not\n[2593.9s] talk about the alpha and omega of\n[2595.2s] apostasy that the book living temple\n[2598.1s] which contain pantheism the teaching of\n[2599.9s] the pantheism which is the strength the\n[2602.2s] personality of the father and the\n[2605.3s] son number two book which was written it\n[2608.6s] question on doctrine that is now the the\n[2612.5s] living temple is the alpha of apostasy\n[2615.1s] and question of doctrine is the omega of\n[2617.1s] the\n[2619.4s] apostasy. Number four book which is the\n[2622.4s] movement of destiny written by Leroy\n[2625.7s] Fume and also the coming of the\n[2627.6s] comforter written by Leroy F and\n[2630.1s] defending the god which is written by\n[2632.0s] Vance farm who have read the defending\n[2635.1s] defending godhead. Have you seen that\n[2639.0s] book? Those are the books of new god.\n[2641.4s] You cannot s but\n[2645.7s] books of new order will be written.\n[2648.8s] Number two, we find that the fundamental\n[2651.9s] principles that have sustained the work\n[2654.4s] for the last 50 years will be discarded\n[2656.5s] as error. How were they discarded? Can\n[2660.6s] you look that timeline? In the year\n[2663.1s] 1872, it was the declaration of the\n[2665.6s] fundamental principle of 7th day\n[2668.4s] Adventist. Reaching the year 1874, the\n[2672.4s] 1872 fundamental principles were\n[2676.3s] published. One was published by James\n[2678.8s] White in science of times. You can go\n[2680.7s] and look in the blue estate. It is\n[2682.1s] there. The second one was was published\n[2685.0s] by Smith in a publishing house called\n[2686.9s] review and herald.\n[2690.8s] Reaching the year\n[2692.8s] 1889, fundamental principle\n[2695.7s] was expanded to 28 without the trinity\n[2701.9s] doctrine. Now come the year 1915. The\n[2705.0s] old seventh adventist have been started\n[2707.0s] to be changed. The doctrine has been\n[2709.4s] started to be changed. Now they come out\n[2712.6s] to the year 1931. Now the yearbooks here\n[2715.7s] book the yearbook with new beliefs. Now\n[2718.8s] it is published. Having the trinity\n[2721.1s] doctrine at the second\n[2723.6s] fundamental\n[2726.8s] principle the third if reformation will\n[2729.4s] take place what will result our\n[2731.3s] religion will be changed and a new\n[2734.5s] organization will be\n[2737.0s] formed let me question what to be\n[2740.9s] considered I'm asking you a question and\n[2743.1s] prepare me answer me quickly how can I\n[2745.8s] change the bu a Buddhist or Islam to be\n[2749.0s] a\n[2750.0s] Christian. How can I change a Buddhist\n[2752.4s] or an Islam to be a Christian?\n[2757.1s] Yes.\n[2759.0s] I'm changing Buddha and I'm changing\n[2761.0s] Allah and bringing to them to the\n[2762.7s] knowledge of the one true God. How can I\n[2766.3s] change old DA church to be\n[2769.5s] Catholics? Changing one true God and\n[2771.7s] bringing up who? The Trinity God.\n[2775.8s] Is it simple like that? For me to change\n[2778.6s] Buddha, Buddhist to be to be Christian,\n[2781.2s] I change Buddha. For me to change Islam,\n[2783.8s] now I change Allah and they come and\n[2786.2s] worship the one true God. It means that\n[2789.4s] our religion will be changed. Seventh\n[2791.7s] Adventist was changed when they accepted\n[2794.2s] what the Trinity\n[2796.5s] doctrine. So now read the words of Nelie\n[2799.6s] Wilson. The year 1981, LC Wilson,\n[2803.1s] General Conference president, announced\n[2805.4s] that the church has officially adopted\n[2808.2s] the Trinity Doctrine, which is now\n[2810.5s] number two in the church 28 fundamental\n[2813.7s] beliefs. Not now they are not principle,\n[2816.6s] but they are now beliefs. Pastor Nell\n[2820.6s] Wilson while president of general\n[2823.3s] conference of seventh adventist. He\n[2826.2s] declares before the seventh adventist\n[2828.0s] church that there is another universal\n[2830.9s] and truly Catholic organization. The\n[2833.7s] seventh day Adventist church. They are\n[2837.5s] not now seventh adventist but they are\n[2839.7s] another universal organization. Catholic\n[2842.3s] church. Seventh 7th day\n[2845.1s] Adventist. Our\n[2847.2s] religion will be done what will be\n[2850.0s] changed. It is also predicted in Bible\n[2853.5s] that when they enter a new organization\n[2856.7s] will be formed. Now there comes new 7th\n[2859.7s] day\n[2861.5s] Adventist. It is being predicted in the\n[2863.8s] Psalm 74 verse number four. For them to\n[2866.9s] change seventh adventist fooling. Psalm\n[2869.5s] 74 verse number four. And I jump to\n[2872.2s] verse number 8 9 10 and 11 is saying\n[2874.4s] that thine enemy ro in thy midst. Who is\n[2877.3s] the\n[2878.2s] enemy? Satan. And white have predicted\n[2881.1s] that the enemy of the soul sought to\n[2883.0s] bring in supposition in the seventh\n[2886.3s] adventist. So th enemies ro in the midst\n[2889.8s] of their congregation. The enemy entered\n[2892.2s] the seventh adventist. Then they set up\n[2894.8s] their banners. They set up their sign.\n[2900.6s] They verse number eight saying they said\n[2902.6s] in their heart let us destroy them\n[2905.2s] together. They have burnt up all the\n[2908.2s] synagogues of the god in thy\n[2911.0s] land. Then we as old seven elephantes\n[2914.4s] now are crying that we see not our\n[2916.8s] signs. There's no any other prophet\n[2919.4s] among us. Elen wise has been stoned and\n[2923.3s] killed among us any knoweth how long.\n[2928.7s] And you will read Proverbs 28 28:19 or\n[2932.2s] 29:18. Where there's no vision, people\n[2935.4s] perish. Where the prophet, where there's\n[2937.6s] no prophet, people are going to do what?\n[2939.4s] To\n[2940.3s] perish. So after the enemy have set up\n[2943.1s] their sign, now comes in verse number\n[2945.9s] 10. Oh God, how long shall the adversary\n[2949.4s] approach? Shall the enemy blasphem thy\n[2952.0s] name forever? Then we are being asked,\n[2954.9s] God is withdrawing his hand. Why\n[2958.4s] withdraw thou thy hand? Even thy right\n[2961.2s] hand pluck it out of thy\n[2964.5s] bosom. So it forces God to now withdraw\n[2967.8s] his son from that 7day Catholic and God\n[2971.3s] may raise up his church once\n[2974.4s] more. The enemy entered the church.\n[2977.5s] There come a communical movement in the\n[2979.4s] church and see the commandment the\n[2980.9s] command of God. The adversary has spread\n[2983.4s] out his hand upon all thy pleasant\n[2986.0s] things. For she had seen that the hidden\n[2990.2s] entered into her sanctuary whom thou\n[2993.0s] didest command that they should not\n[2994.9s] enter into thy congregation. God\n[2998.3s] commanded that the hidden seven advent\n[3001.7s] should\n[3003.0s] not do a chemical movement but the\n[3006.9s] enemy try to do what? To get in. to get\n[3011.2s] in. I don't just have a phone but in\n[3014.6s] five of page 90\n[3017.1s] something that coming the 1860 what 1863\n[3021.8s] the executive\n[3022.9s] committee 6 then three then\n[3026.5s] what then 11 then 13 then\n[3036.2s] 25 for to call theirselves gone. So see\n[3041.9s] how our banner is being changed and how\n[3044.2s] this religion is being formed on another\n[3046.3s] religion. Then I just finish. Go with\n[3048.3s] me. Ezekiel 8 verse number 14 to\n[3051.1s] 16. He's saying then he brought me to\n[3054.3s] the door of the gate of the Lord's house\n[3057.0s] which was towards the north and behold\n[3060.4s] there sat a woman weeping for tamuz.\n[3065.4s] So it means that the church of God there\n[3067.4s] come a point that they started to\n[3069.0s] worship\n[3070.8s] Damos. Consider verse 15 and 16. He's\n[3073.7s] saying, \"Then said he unto me, hast thou\n[3077.0s] seen this, oh son of man, turn thee yet\n[3080.6s] again, and thou shalt see greater\n[3083.1s] abomination than you are seeing now?\"\n[3086.0s] And he brought me into the inner court\n[3088.2s] of the Lord's house. And behold, at the\n[3090.6s] door of the temple of the Lord, between\n[3092.7s] the porch and the altar, about five and\n[3097.0s] 20 men with their backs towards the\n[3100.2s] temple of the Lord, and their faces\n[3102.3s] towards the east, and they worship the\n[3105.1s] sons towards the\n[3107.2s] east. So see what is being done in the\n[3109.7s] church of God. They bring up taboos.\n[3112.2s] Number one. Number two, they start\n[3114.5s] worshiping the sun. The sun is worshiped\n[3117.0s] in three\n[3122.0s] ways. How can I put in English? When sun\n[3124.9s] is arising, the midday and what? When\n[3127.7s] sun is setting. So it is God the father,\n[3130.7s] God the son and God the holy spirit. See\n[3134.7s] we have three stages of\n[3137.5s] sun and here is so they start worshiping\n[3141.2s] the trinity god.\n[3143.8s] When the sun is coming from this side on\n[3146.2s] the middle, God the father, God the son\n[3148.2s] and God the holy\n[3149.9s] spirit. Beside worshiping the son, the\n[3152.7s] trinity god, they also start to worship\n[3155.0s] what?\n[3156.8s] Tamuz. What does tamuz means in seventh\n[3159.2s] day adventist? Go with me.\n[3162.1s] HBS.\n[3165.6s] HBS. HBS page\n[3168.9s] 145.4. So you see cross Babylonian\n[3172.4s] origin. He's saying that the same sign\n[3175.1s] of the cross that Rome now worshiped was\n[3178.3s] used in Babylonian mysteries. Read with\n[3181.5s] me was applied by paganism to sign magic\n[3185.6s] purposes was honored with the same\n[3188.8s] honors. Then that which is now called\n[3191.9s] the Christian cross was originally not\n[3195.4s] Christian emblem at all but was the\n[3199.4s] mystic tu of the chaldines and\n[3203.1s] Egyptians. The true origin from the\n[3205.5s] letter T the initial name of Tamuz. So\n[3209.8s] where does the cross come\n[3211.6s] from? The Chaldans and the Egyptians and\n[3214.6s] the Babylonians. That's why the cross is\n[3217.5s] letter T. Do you see\n[3221.0s] that when it is to to really come\n[3223.7s] apostate they must bring that cross into\n[3226.4s] the church they must also worship the\n[3229.2s] trinity\n[3232.5s] god are you getting me that's why now\n[3237.0s] when you term seventh advent now you\n[3239.0s] find two people old seventh adventist\n[3240.7s] and new 7th day adventist it is\n[3243.4s] predicted by len white in 2 SMPP 385\n[3246.2s] paragraph number two he's saying that a\n[3248.2s] company was presented before me under\n[3250.1s] the name Seventh Day Adventist who were\n[3253.0s] advising that the banner or sign which\n[3255.9s] make us a distinct people should not be\n[3258.7s] held. So strikingly they're saying that\n[3261.8s] this banner really separate us from many\n[3265.2s] denominations. Now they saying that the\n[3267.2s] banner of the three angels we should not\n[3269.8s] like that. Then they remove the banner\n[3272.3s] when the adversary come in. Now the\n[3274.2s] adversary set up is what? the banner,\n[3276.8s] the banner of the devil. For they claim\n[3279.6s] that it was not the best policy of\n[3281.3s] securing sus institution. But this\n[3285.0s] distinct banner is to be born through\n[3287.6s] the world to the clause of\n[3291.3s] probation. You read great controversy\n[3293.5s] page 568 paragraph number two say that\n[3295.8s] papies place crosses upon their judges\n[3298.5s] upon their altars and upon their\n[3301.8s] garments. also seventh adventist papers\n[3306.2s] all Catholic seventh day Adventist place\n[3309.0s] crosses upon their churches upon their\n[3312.5s] altars and upon their\n[3316.3s] sit that and the angel only they are\n[3320.7s] wise seven is already wise people are\n[3324.5s] placing using\n[3326.8s] what unithood but they are placing using\n[3330.8s] comp computers\n[3333.2s] computer. But they are placing using\n[3336.4s] what? Some are placing using the\n[3340.4s] hoods. Everywhere seen the insignia of\n[3343.0s] the cross. Everywhere it\n[3345.2s] is outwardly honored and exalted by the\n[3348.8s] teaching of Christ are buried beneath\n[3350.3s] the mass of sens tradition, false\n[3352.6s] interpretation and uh rigorous exaction.\n[3358.1s] So, a question worth asking asking you\n[3361.7s] as I\n[3363.6s] finish. Do you look on the screen? A\n[3367.0s] question worth asking. I'm asking you a\n[3370.0s] question in the book of Psalms 11 verse\n[3372.2s] number\n[3373.3s] 13. I'm asking you a\n[3376.8s] question. Psalms 11 verse number three.\n[3380.2s] That if the foundation be destroyed,\n[3383.1s] what can the Russians do?\n[3387.9s] If the foundation had destroyed, what\n[3389.8s] can the Russians do?\n[3394.2s] Who can give me clear answer? If the\n[3395.8s] foundation, if Steven has really been\n[3400.0s] destroyed, what can the Russians\n[3403.9s] do? Who can give me the answer? Felix.\n[3407.5s] What can the Russians do?\n[3411.0s] rebuilding the the answer is in the book\n[3413.7s] of Isaiah\n[3414.9s] 58:12. Question is, if the foundation be\n[3418.0s] destroyed, what can the Russians do?\n[3420.8s] Then he say, \"And they that shall be\n[3423.4s] shall uh they that shall be of thee\n[3426.0s] shall build the old waste places. Thou\n[3429.7s] shall raise up the foundation of many\n[3431.5s] generation, and thou shalt be called the\n[3433.7s] repairers of the bridge, the restorers\n[3435.8s] of the path to dwell in.\" Praise God. So\n[3439.8s] our work is to go to the old west places\n[3443.7s] and do what? And\n[3445.8s] rebuild because the command now come\n[3448.2s] that we should not come out of the old\n[3452.0s] landmarks. That's why God is saying in\n[3454.2s] the book of Jeremiah 6 verse number 16\n[3455.9s] that thus says the Lord stand in the\n[3458.4s] way. When we are being published like\n[3460.2s] this what should we do? We stand in the\n[3463.3s] way and see and ask for the old 7th day\n[3466.6s] Adventist church and ask that where is\n[3469.6s] the old seventh adventist doctrine and\n[3472.4s] walk therein and we are going to find\n[3474.8s] rest in the second advent of\n[3477.9s] Christ. Now God is\n[3481.0s] calling now God is calling us to restore\n[3484.8s] and be old 7th day Adventist. That's why\n[3488.6s] we are calling ourselves old what?\n[3492.2s] Rebuilding the old foundation. The\n[3496.0s] commandment came in proverbs\n[3498.7s] 22:28 that remove not the ancient\n[3501.2s] landmarks which thy fathers have\n[3504.0s] said that is the command that came\n[3506.9s] because Deuteronomy 32:7 in that ask thy\n[3509.4s] fathers and they will shield thee.\n[3513.0s] Proverbs 32:28 that remove not the\n[3515.0s] ancient landmarks we thy fathers have\n[3517.2s] set. Remove not the old landmarks and\n[3519.5s] enter not in the fields of the fathers.\n[3522.7s] God is calling us to the three angels\n[3524.6s] message of 7th Adventist church. We are\n[3527.4s] being called to restore our\n[3529.4s] banner to become all seventh day\n[3532.5s] Adventist. But when we are come to\n[3534.5s] rebuild the whole foundation I want you\n[3535.9s] to mark this point. Mark this point. We\n[3540.9s] not are coming here. We are not coming\n[3542.1s] with the mind of the world. But mark\n[3544.6s] this point. 1 Corinthians 3 11. For\n[3547.7s] other foundation can no man lay than\n[3550.4s] that which is laid than that is laid\n[3553.8s] which is Jesus Christ. We are not laying\n[3557.4s] any other foundation. We are not we are\n[3560.2s] not doing anything but we are being\n[3562.0s] called to rebel. To rebel. No any other\n[3565.3s] foundation can we lay. We can start.\n[3567.6s] know any other church than that which\n[3569.8s] was laid by who? By Jesus Christ. But\n[3573.7s] when we have come to what to lay the\n[3576.9s] first lesson was the foundation of our\n[3578.9s] work. We go to Ephesians 2 verse number\n[3581.4s] 20. We say that are built upon the\n[3584.0s] foundation of the apostle and the\n[3586.3s] prophets. Jesus Christ himself being the\n[3588.9s] chief cornerstone. And of the first\n[3591.2s] lesson when we are rebuilding we are\n[3593.2s] going first to Jesus who is the Bible\n[3595.2s] and the scriptures. We are going to\n[3597.7s] build also from the pioneers who is\n[3600.2s] Ellen White writings and also we are\n[3603.2s] going to the apostles who are the pio\n[3606.3s] pioneers. Praise\n[3608.4s] God. We are being called mark this\n[3612.7s] point that we are being called to build\n[3615.0s] upon the old foundation. I should learn\n[3618.2s] my lesson at that point because my time\n[3620.1s] is much spent. In the next lesson I will\n[3622.7s] try so much\n[3624.0s] to I should handle something on\n[3628.0s] the I've tried to handle but I will try\n[3632.8s] to finish my lesson on Friday. Is there\n[3634.9s] anyone with a\n[3636.4s] question\n[3639.5s] then I pray then I give you chance.\n[3642.6s] Thank you. Can you can you pray then I\n[3645.2s] give you\n[3648.5s] chance?\n[3654.1s] Our father and God in heaven, thank you\n[3656.8s] so much for this wonderful morning.\n[3659.7s] Thank you for the word that thou have\n[3661.1s] shared with us. I really plead before\n[3662.6s] the cross that before the close of\n[3665.0s] probation, may you help us to restore\n[3667.3s] the old foundation and go back to the\n[3669.8s] old seventh adventist and walk in the\n[3672.2s] true principles of thine way. I really\n[3674.6s] pray may you help that children who are\n[3676.2s] making decision to stand within the ways\n[3677.8s] of righteousness that they may not\n[3680.2s] remove the old landmarks. Above all may\n[3682.5s] thy will be done. I plead in Jesus name."

You need to understand this. their realize that information they are schools to take against Christian law they know necessary for a proposing was one of the object of Islam Islam is the object of their reforms they study the Bible they establish schools that teachers are provided together.

So you just know that from their [Music] own [Music] lyation that existed during that time and that was the image according to them. They realize that they have to learn their own process of work that they are good to their teachers and they mess. Amen. So what did they do after realizing that with me they didn't completely look in These words by using to take the stand with the testimony. Hallelujah. There are people who are such a pain. But in this last days, it will require more and are together. During that time, there was also challenges. Are you together? There was also impossibility impossibilities but it required and this last decided to strengthen the commission must and to be done by must be studs our own teacher methods and principles of the training there. for the translation to take the time with the [Music] testimony. They will receive the mark of the beast. The mark of the [Music] Y if children will continue going in popular education they're going to receive what the mark of the change their schools of the name so we thought that we were living to the light of the present time. So I'm talking I was talking about but now this one is to these people who are sitting in front are we together now we made up the life of the present time we see yeah clearly are we together so we should be advancing schools this is together that in the land of the present time we will see it remarkably that their children continue to go to the popular school they will present as will compel them to assist in giving life to the way of the world [Music] today how many of You know you are talking about yoga but never need to understand this. [Applause] Consing their education from men to children which will bring upon a sing darkness greater than has ever been known before. Are you next? Let me go to the next. Now look at this. is important that young adventist are together. How many are seven in this congregation? Now listen to this. of their message. They never understood the truth of God. Now we are doing a second that we to that history and war. So we are told that we cast aside the spirit of God and thus lose our place in the king in the kingdom. Hallelujah. If seven is sed where they must have a what? We must say the Bible the testimony says that we should or we must so we are at a point where we need to put this into practical that we must have as educated by the way when I was beginning my class that somebody who doesn't want to go to school I I'll be the first person to take him to the We are told that succeed where we must have gain principles which in develop the peace and network together is totally different from the popular education school different from this Now all these things are there for examples they are positioning the so we must have schools I was that was studies on Christian education you guys get that book I think it is page seven is most difficult right this is not a discouragement I have to understand this quotation This one is found that is difficult to practice what right. Hallelujah. I know it is difficult difficult. That is why it requires and what faith. Amen. It is most difficult to practice right principles after having been so long to the practice of our That's more Are we together? This thing is different. Hallelujah. No one is going to be forced to make. Hallelujah. compared to the last days in that as the strongest are like one by the truth by the truth will enter are the forms of that food with them soon. Hallelujah. We need to have we need to have a will to establish what schools I'll be playing with parents by the end of this presentation today because if going to be then we are going to establish our schools. So maybe with a but doesn't mean you see people being in that system will get the likes of they will be putting they will be changing the history but it does not mean air truth together too long have the customs and habits the longer will now have every idea that is false put away from teachers and the students now this one [Music] 28 28 God's purpose in giving the message to the world is to prepare people to stand true to him during the [Applause] Christ is doing Christ is doing that that mean our schools our [Applause] identific I'm interested on all these things but my point of interest so much is that we must have one schools do it together we must own schools so look at that every home should be hallelujah every I'm giving the solutions to education I'm giving the solutions to what education you need to [Music] understand realizing here that everyone from a church. Hallelujah. Do you know that the family is the basic unit of Hallelujah? The family are the same things that will be transformed by the church. Amen. Because church is made up. Let me use my mouth now. these things out. We are told that the family is the basic unit because the church is made of family. Are we together? The church is made of families. The is made of what? So every home should be a church. Now get that. That every in the home life should be a church. A beautiful symbol of the church of God in her in heaven. If parents realized their responsibility to their children, they will not under any circumstance circumstance go and pray at the at them. If parents are going to realize their what kinds are going to responsibility and I know somebody will be asking this people who are rejected by their parents solution. Amen. But parents who are living who has a knowledge of the message need to understand their what the responsibility. So we are told that every home should be a what? A judge. Next slide says for each church. Hallelujah. Every home should be a what? A church. For each what? Church. Now get the quote. The quotation says in all our churches and wherever there's a company of believers. Hallelujah. You see this this thing is narrowing down to personal responsibility part. Amen. Because if every home should be a a church and then if for each church in all our churches and wherever there's a company of what believer church school should be established man I wanted to bring it to a personal responsibility so that church members need to understand that the work of establishing a school begins with you personal know there's a problem today with the church that church members I don't know who they're waiting for I don't know they waiting for the leaders of organization I don't know who they are reaching for they cannot take it at personal what capacity that is why you cannot establish schools now the ones that have been established are paying because people does not take personal what capacity you realize that somebody will take a child but doesn't care anything but the child systemation is able to sacrifice everything and take money to that place so this thing should narrow down to a personal what responsibility Hallelujah. That in all our churches and wherever there is a company of believers, a church school should be established. And I know that there are challenges. Amen. For you to do this, you will require more courage and what? Unpaid. Amen. I know there are challenges even in this last days. I know how the government will be striving so much hard to interfere with this. But that does not make this truth and an air. Are we together? Challenges should not make sugar and and those people should be taught in the last days to know how to shape challenges and shape challenges to shape them. Amen. Are we together? So we are told that a church school should be established and this schools there should be teachers with the true missionary what spirit for the children are to be trained to become missionaries. It is essential that the teachers be educated to act their part instructing children of Sabbath keepers not only in the sciences but in the script scriptures. These schools established in different what localities. Hallelujah. Schools should be established in different localities. We need to have a school in next to this place. We have a school in Kisum. We have a school in Nan. We have a school in they should be established in different what localities and we are told that too this school localities and conducted by godbearing men and we women. Hallelujah. I am showing the qualifications of a teacher as the case demands should be upon the same principles as for the schools of the pro prophets. Hallelujah. Did you see the kind of knowledge that was from the school of prophets? It was a wisdom that exited the universities of United States. So if both people are going to have more courage and what fail then we are going to establish a schools where children will be given a wisdom that exist of the what the land are we together. It is only that people lack courage and what fame. Amen. Even with presenting this today, I laid if you going to pray for it. Amen. And I know most people are praying God will give them what they want. They want if they enter into reforms with what with heart, soul and we we are we together. this reform if you are still entertaining your word your decision and regret regretting but we need to pray that God may give us a humble what spirit and a heart and a will that will help us establish this re reforms so we are told that I say again establish that Establish schools for the children. Whenever there are churches where there are those who assembled to worship God, let there be what? Schools for the children. Hallelujah. Whenever there people who are assembled to do what? Hallelujah. Amen. Today we have churches people are assembling for worship but they cannot work on the young. The young will only meet somebody on a supper during the classes of lessons. Are you together? By the way, we are not going to help but we can we can be talking about movement but we know that uh what is the result of false? Yeah. recruits of false what is false education says to get at the root of the matter the young is separated as from popular education as the old is separated from false I'll read that on Friday it is in 081 that will make my lesson on Friday so I say again establish schools for the children wherever there are churches where there are those who assembled to worship let there be schools for their children. Work as if you were waking for your life to save children from being drowned in the polluting corrupting influence of their life. Are we together? If people would be encouraged, if people would be encouraged, the church in which they are members and establish small humble school buildings in which to do service for God, they will accommodate their own what? Children within their borders. Are we together? I'm reading this and somebody saying, \"Is this possible?\" Hallelujah. It is possible because God has said, \"Amen.\" Yeah, that is possible because God has said, \"Do you think God can give us such and God doesn't give us a solution?\" Do you think this reform God will leave us just to No, it's only because we have not taken a step a step. That is why we have problems in the church. I know and I'm sure that when we shall enter upon this reforms with a willing heart, God will stand for us. Are we together? So we are told that if not more than six children. So look at that in localities where there's a church a school should be established. If there are no more no more than six children to attend, a teacher should be employed. Which should be employed? who will educate the children in the truths of the word of God which are so essential for this last word last days and which it is so important for them to do what to understand a great test is to doing what is coming it will be upon obedience or disobedience to the commandments of God so decision must be made a decision must be made now look at this that is that was churches Where the deceiver in churches we can have what schools but look at this also this one can also be done several churches unite unite. Hallelujah. Several churches to do what? Unite wherever there are few Sabbath schools you know I know in this information movements we are still beginning that is a church where people meet three are together three of them. So we are told that whenever they refuse what schools let the parents let who parents unite together in providing a place for de school where the children of various peoples can come together together. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. And I know I will be asking a class question. this one I also need help but when we establish schools when we establish these schools I will be able to I'll answer I'll ask that question to the class because I need also help so these parents should come together and I know that even when somebody was yesterday because of the the message they are what we call the parents of the faith okay and therefore God has blessed you know that you have many children. Amen. Parents who are here parents by hand get to understand that you don't so many I'll be your first look at this. So we are told let them employ a Christian teacher who was a concentrated missionary who who as a concentrated missionary shall educate the children in such a way to get them to become missionaries themselves. Why? When it is the day for the night, what when no man can do what? We should have private schools in different localities to prepare our youth for our high what? Schools. Are we together? We should have what? Private schools. That is where my question comes. I have I've been struggling to know how this private school can be done. I'm going to ask that question to the class. Prepare an answer. We should private schools. Amen. I'm going very fast. Some we left out and this private schools the following are puppets to be studied schools because we say this look at this look at this that textbooks teachers method and break principles principles but God has given us everything everything is is in in is in his word is why amen. So after schools have been established teachers should be pro provided. Therefore the following should be established the following should be studied. I want somebody will be helping me reading this quotation. I don't know if you can open this open the place of Bible the place of Bible you can be in 124.

The Bible should be the child's first textbook. From this book. From this book, parents are to give instruction. I want to get something. So, the first thing is the Bible. Just copy this and be explaining the following bhani that is al another course of study I'm going to explain while reading simple arithmetic accounting hallelujah simple arithmetic what accounting children needs to know simple arithmetical accounting nature physiology nature physiology history stroke prophecy history stroke prophecy the law the law children must be taught the law the law I'm going to explain that cooker children must know to cook amen same anatomy and physiology children must understand anatomy as what physiology physical geography physical geography hygiene must be music. I'm waiting for the phone. Somebody was telling me this phone. You need your phone. Not mine. Good. Let us see. Music literature. And in literature there's spelling, reading, and writing. And that one will deal with language. Those ones must directly just say it. I find it crazy. It is go to place of Bible education just go to what should be stud the schools and they're just lying there. We shall be reading each one the few steps we explain because even these things are also some of them are studied in popular education but you see this how we need to explain them to people so that people get to understand what they shall be teaching their children should also be taught missionary work should also be will tell you that in this school compound there should be a war. There should be a what? Amen. Where children learn to produce their own what? Hallelujah. So that that form parts of their that form parts part of their lessons. Let me read this to explain the glory. Interesting. So listen to this. I'm reading pamplet 124 page 15 paragraph 3 says the following words 124 page 15 paragraph 3 says this one I have to read no line of manual training is of more value than agriculture agriculture let the teacher call attention to what the Bible says about agriculture the study of let not only theory but what practical I return to simple methods I return to simple methods efforts will be appreciated by the children and you work in the garden and fail will be agree will be agreeable change from the way some routine of the abstract what lessons are we together after the lessons about even was teaching history and prophecy what she take next is now agree agriculture to hell that when people in class they need to relax Are you so compound there should be a hallelujah? Those who desiring to establish schools need to understand this. Every school compound must be a physiology should also be taught. I don't want to read all these things. I plan to read them and I plan to read something in the place of the Bible education but my time is running so much. I don't but I want us to see this 15 minutes. You know people ask questions let me read this the following I'm reading only this part of teachers then because my time is up others also somewhere I don't want to be somebody's time my last class I'll be able to analyze everything so we are told that I'm not now talking about teachers we have seen the topics to be studied in education we have seen that the schools must be established and we've seen the solution how to establish schools parents must have personal responsibility. If there are few school members somewhere, they can unite with others to establish a what? School. And I know it is possible because God has saved. Amen. So it has been the custom to encourage them. It has been the custom to encourage sending children to school when they were more babies needing a mother a mother's. Amen. That is what is happening today. Parents should be they all be teachers of their children until they have reached age what? 10 years 10 years. So first responsibility until 8 or 10 years. Do not send your little ones away to school to a mother should be careful how she trusts the modeling of the infant mind to other hands. Hallelujah. By the way, the mother has a great responsibility in teaching the child more than the the father. The father also has a great responsibility. But the mother's responsibilities have high. Do you know that is very very easy for a character to be transmitted from the mother to the child more than the are the angel went to who? Samson's mother. and is attracted how Samsung was to be educated. So the mothers mothers have a great responsibility. So parents ought to be the best teachers of their children until they have reached 8 or 10 years of age. So who's the best teacher to the child at younger age? Both best parents best but mother will have great responsibility. Okay. Okay. Let let me read this. Let me read this. But both of them has a great responsibility. Parents ought to be the best teachers of their children until they have reached 8 or 10 years of age. Their school room should be what? Open air and the flowers and back. Talk to me. Just talk to me. What is their school room? Somebody just read that aloud. What is their school room? Open air ams the treasures of nature. So we are told about something here. I'm coming back to that. But let me see the qualifications of teachers who are teach children in our schools. We are not a special talent be given to the education of the youth. The principles and habits of the teacher should be considered of greater importance than even is literally qualifications. What should be considered in a teacher? The principles and hies of the teachers. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you are going to establish a school, the first thing to look in the principles and not just teachers because they are teachers manipulation and knowledge in science to instruct. One may have what? sufficient educ education and knowledge in science to do what? To instruct but has it been orained that has tact and wisdom to deal with the human what might mind. Are we together? Those are qualifications. Those who are deciding to establish schools kindly write this. Let none feel that let none feel that having an ear honestness in religious matters is all that is essential in order to become when they need no less of piety. They also need a par knowledge of what? Science. Amen. So a knowledge of science must be the teachers must have and their habits and character must also be the good. They should also qualify to be dealing with minds. Amen. And in this last days we need wise teachers because people have so long been poverted by the educational system. If somebody comes self the teacher cannot deal with the mind you will be having a problem in that school that school and I know the problem I know that there people in teaching this God has placed them here. It is only that you have not recognized them or those abilities belong to somewhere else. The good news of God needs teachers who have a high moral qualities and can be trusted with education of others. Men who are of who are sound in the in the faith and have attacked and patient who walk with God and abstain from every appearance of what? Hallelujah. And abain from every appearance of what? If you take a teacher who cannot abstain from every appearance of you will have a problem in that school. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So teachers who must go to those schools must be a people who can be able to abstain from every appearance of all. I hope you are getting me.

You can deny that you don't have money. Amen. Seventh element have plenty of what? Money. But it does not belong to the what? Here's the problem. We have money but that money doesn't belong in the world. That is why we don't one school as we speak. But we have what? Money establish. We have money that can run gigs.

May God help us. Amen. May God help us to be church members in Jesus name. Amen. Allow me pray then I give time for questions. We thank you dear father in heaven for the solutions and everything are clearly defined in your word. The reason why this church has failed is that all the talents and abilities and faculties that are needed to establish suits today we have plenty of them but they belong the world. Dear Lord in heaven is our prayer. I know there's one parent in this meeting who is desiring to disconnect herself or himself with the world and to be a church man. Lord in heaven as you are helping your people by the end of this meeting. Help the parents in this congregation to be church members so that we might have enough facilities for this church to establish schools and run them. Help us dear Lord in heaven to make us there and help us to be your children. Forgive us for our wrongdoing and help us and walk with us in every step of life. This is my prayer by faith in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Uh I want I want to take very few questions. Let me assure you that we are going to use the time we are going to dedicate to Christians before the end of this meeting because I know when people waste time out somebody should be ending this should be ending",

Are you\n[1016.1s] next? Let me go to the next. Now look at\n[1019.3s] this. is important that\n[1023.2s] young adventist are together. How many\n[1026.2s] are seven in this\n[1029.9s] congregation? Now listen to this.\n[1043.2s] of\n[1047.8s] their message. They never understood the\n[1050.6s] truth of\n[1051.7s] God. Now we are doing a second that we\n[1063.2s] to\n[1066.7s] that history and war. So we are told\n[1071.6s] that\n[1073.5s] we cast aside the spirit of God and thus\n[1079.0s] lose our place in the king in the\n[1081.2s] kingdom. Hallelujah. If seven is\n[1086.1s] sed where\n[1088.0s] they must have a what?\n[1092.3s] We must\n[1094.0s] say the Bible the testimony says that we\n[1098.2s] should or we\n[1099.5s] must so we are at a point where we need\n[1102.6s] to put this into\n[1105.5s] practical that we must have\n[1112.0s] as educated by the way when I was\n[1115.7s] beginning my class that somebody who\n[1117.3s] doesn't want to go to school I I'll be\n[1120.1s] the first person to take him to the\n[1123.4s] We are told\n[1124.6s] that succeed where we must\n[1129.9s] have gain principles which in develop\n[1133.8s] the peace and\n[1135.5s] network\n[1137.6s] together is totally different from the\n[1140.2s] popular\n[1143.6s] education\n[1145.7s] school different from this\n[1151.8s] Now all these things are\n[1154.0s] there for examples they are positioning\n[1159.8s] the so we must have\n[1162.8s] schools I was that was studies on\n[1165.5s] Christian education you guys get that\n[1168.2s] book I think it is page\n[1172.4s] seven is most difficult right this is\n[1177.1s] not a discouragement I have to\n[1179.4s] understand this quotation This one is\n[1184.0s] found that\n[1186.2s] is difficult to practice what\n[1191.2s] right. Hallelujah. I know it is\n[1194.3s] difficult difficult. That is why it\n[1196.6s] requires and what faith. Amen. It is\n[1200.4s] most difficult to practice right\n[1202.4s] principles after having been so\n[1205.3s] long to the practice of our\n[1210.5s] That's\n[1228.2s] more Are we together?\n[1231.4s] This thing is\n[1240.1s] different. Hallelujah. No one is going\n[1242.7s] to be forced to\n[1245.5s] make. Hallelujah.\n[1251.6s] compared\n[1253.3s] to the last\n[1259.2s] days in that as the\n[1262.7s] strongest are like\n[1275.4s] one by the\n[1277.6s] truth by the truth will enter are the\n[1281.2s] forms of that food with them\n[1284.4s] soon.\n[1286.7s] Hallelujah. We need to have we need to\n[1289.7s] have a will to establish what\n[1293.0s] schools I'll be playing with parents by\n[1295.6s] the end of this presentation today\n[1297.8s] because if going to be then we are going\n[1300.5s] to establish our schools. So\n[1304.6s] maybe with a but doesn't\n[1312.8s] mean you see people being in that system\n[1315.9s] will get the likes of they will be\n[1319.4s] putting they will be changing the\n[1321.4s] history but it does not mean air\n[1327.9s] truth together too long have the customs\n[1331.6s] and habits the longer will now have\n[1335.8s] every idea that is false put away from\n[1339.4s] teachers and the\n[1342.3s] students now this one\n[1345.3s] [Music]\n[1347.2s] 28\n[1349.6s] 28 God's purpose in giving the message\n[1353.1s] to the world is to prepare people to\n[1355.8s] stand true to him during the\n[1360.2s] [Applause]\n[1362.0s] Christ is\n[1363.5s] doing Christ is\n[1370.4s] doing that\n[1379.8s] that\n[1383.7s] mean our schools our\n[1394.2s] [Applause]\n[1396.0s] identific I'm interested on all these\n[1398.6s] things but my point of interest so much\n[1401.0s] is that we must have one schools do it\n[1404.6s] together we\n[1406.4s] must own schools so look at that every\n[1410.3s] home should\n[1411.5s] be hallelujah\n[1414.5s] every I'm giving the solutions to\n[1416.8s] education\n[1418.5s] I'm giving the solutions to what\n[1420.6s] education you need to\n[1425.5s] [Music]\n[1429.0s] understand\n[1444.4s] realizing here that everyone\n[1447.8s] from a church. Hallelujah. Do you know\n[1452.9s] that the family is the basic unit\n[1456.0s] of\n[1459.1s] Hallelujah? The family are the same\n[1461.4s] things that will be transformed by the\n[1463.9s] church.\n[1466.0s] Amen. Because church is made\n[1470.4s] up. Let me use my mouth now. these\n[1473.2s] things out. We are told that the family\n[1477.4s] is the basic unit because the church is\n[1479.9s] made of family. Are we together? The\n[1482.6s] church is made of families. The is made\n[1485.6s] of what? So every home should be a\n[1489.0s] church. Now get that. That every in the\n[1492.6s] home life should be a church. A\n[1495.7s] beautiful symbol of the church of God in\n[1498.7s] her in heaven. If parents realized their\n[1502.4s] responsibility to their children, they\n[1504.6s] will not under any\n[1506.9s] circumstance circumstance go and pray at\n[1510.6s] the at them. If parents are going to\n[1513.0s] realize their\n[1514.6s] what\n[1516.4s] kinds are going to responsibility and I\n[1520.9s] know somebody will be\n[1522.5s] asking\n[1524.1s] this people who are rejected by their\n[1527.1s] parents solution. Amen.\n[1529.9s] But parents who are living who has a\n[1532.7s] knowledge of the message need to\n[1534.7s] understand their what the\n[1535.8s] responsibility. So we are told that\n[1537.4s] every home should be a what? A judge.\n[1541.5s] Next slide says for each\n[1544.0s] church. Hallelujah. Every home should be\n[1547.6s] a what? A church. For each what? Church.\n[1551.8s] Now get the quote. The quotation says in\n[1554.3s] all our churches and wherever there's a\n[1556.5s] company of believers.\n[1559.0s] Hallelujah. You see this this thing is\n[1561.2s] narrowing down to personal\n[1562.8s] responsibility part. Amen. Because if\n[1565.4s] every home should be a a church and then\n[1568.6s] if for each church in all our churches\n[1570.6s] and wherever there's a company of what\n[1572.6s] believer church school should be\n[1575.8s] established man I wanted to bring it to\n[1578.7s] a personal responsibility so that church\n[1581.3s] members need to understand that the work\n[1583.6s] of establishing a school begins with you\n[1587.1s] personal know there's a problem today\n[1589.0s] with the church that church members I\n[1590.9s] don't know who they're waiting for I\n[1592.9s] don't know they waiting for the leaders\n[1594.2s] of organization I don't know who they\n[1596.2s] are reaching for they cannot take it at\n[1598.2s] personal what capacity that is why you\n[1600.8s] cannot establish schools now the ones\n[1603.4s] that have been established are paying\n[1605.8s] because people does not take personal\n[1607.8s] what capacity you realize that somebody\n[1610.2s] will take a child but doesn't care\n[1614.0s] anything but the child systemation is\n[1617.4s] able to sacrifice everything and take\n[1619.1s] money to that place so this thing should\n[1621.6s] narrow down to a personal what\n[1623.7s] responsibility\n[1624.7s] Hallelujah. That in all our churches and\n[1628.3s] wherever there is a company of\n[1629.7s] believers, a church school should be\n[1632.5s] established. And I know that there are\n[1635.5s] challenges. Amen. For you to do this,\n[1637.6s] you will require more courage and what?\n[1639.4s] Unpaid. Amen. I know there are\n[1641.8s] challenges even in this last days. I\n[1643.4s] know how the government will be striving\n[1645.1s] so much hard to interfere with this. But\n[1647.3s] that does not make this truth and an\n[1651.0s] air. Are we together? Challenges should\n[1653.1s] not make sugar and and those people\n[1655.8s] should be taught in the last days to\n[1657.4s] know how to shape challenges and shape\n[1660.1s] challenges to shape them. Amen. Are we\n[1662.4s] together? So we are told that a church\n[1664.4s] school should be established and this\n[1666.2s] schools there should be teachers with\n[1669.4s] the true missionary what spirit for the\n[1672.3s] children are to be trained to become\n[1674.6s] missionaries. It is essential that the\n[1676.9s] teachers be educated to act their part\n[1679.4s] instructing children of Sabbath keepers\n[1682.0s] not only in the sciences but in the\n[1685.0s] script scriptures. These schools\n[1688.3s] established in different what\n[1690.5s] localities. Hallelujah. Schools should\n[1693.3s] be established in different localities.\n[1695.9s] We need to have a school in next to this\n[1698.5s] place. We have a school in Kisum. We\n[1700.5s] have a school in Nan. We have a school\n[1702.4s] in they should be established in\n[1704.2s] different what localities and we are\n[1707.2s] told that\n[1708.8s] too this school localities and conducted\n[1712.8s] by godbearing men and we women.\n[1715.4s] Hallelujah. I am showing the\n[1717.1s] qualifications of a\n[1719.7s] teacher as the case demands should be\n[1723.7s] upon the same principles as for the\n[1725.8s] schools of the pro prophets. Hallelujah.\n[1728.8s] Did you see the kind of knowledge that\n[1730.4s] was from the school of prophets? It was\n[1732.5s] a wisdom that exited the universities of\n[1735.6s] United States. So if both people are\n[1738.2s] going to have more courage and what fail\n[1741.3s] then we are going to establish a schools\n[1743.4s] where children will be given a wisdom\n[1745.6s] that exist of the what the land are we\n[1749.1s] together. It is only that people lack\n[1751.3s] courage and what fame. Amen. Even with\n[1755.0s] presenting this today, I\n[1757.6s] laid if you going to pray for it. Amen.\n[1762.2s] And I know most people are praying God\n[1764.6s] will give them what they want. They want\n[1767.0s] if they enter into reforms with\n[1769.5s] what with heart, soul and we we are we\n[1774.4s] together. this\n[1778.4s] reform if you are still\n[1789.3s] entertaining your word your decision and\n[1791.8s] regret regretting but we need to pray\n[1794.1s] that God may give us a humble what\n[1796.1s] spirit and a heart and a will that will\n[1798.2s] help us establish this re reforms so we\n[1801.2s] are told that I say again establish that\n[1804.6s] Establish schools for the children.\n[1807.3s] Whenever there are churches where there\n[1810.6s] are those who assembled to worship God,\n[1812.8s] let there be what? Schools for\n[1815.6s] the children. Hallelujah. Whenever there\n[1820.0s] people who are assembled to do what?\n[1823.0s] Hallelujah. Amen. Today we have churches\n[1825.1s] people are assembling for worship but\n[1826.5s] they cannot work on the young. The young\n[1828.7s] will only meet somebody on a supper\n[1832.0s] during the classes of\n[1833.7s] lessons. Are you together? By the way,\n[1836.7s] we are not going to help but we can we\n[1839.9s] can be talking about movement but we\n[1843.1s] know that\n[1845.0s] uh what is the result of false?\n[1852.9s] Yeah.\n[1854.1s] recruits of false what is false\n[1858.5s] education says to get at the root of the\n[1861.4s] matter the young is separated as from\n[1864.9s] popular education as the old is\n[1866.9s] separated from\n[1869.0s] false I'll read that on Friday it is in\n[1872.2s] 081 that will make my lesson on Friday\n[1874.7s] so I say again establish schools for the\n[1876.7s] children wherever there are churches\n[1879.1s] where there are those who assembled to\n[1881.3s] worship let there be schools for their\n[1883.4s] children. Work as if you were waking for\n[1885.8s] your life to save children from being\n[1888.5s] drowned in the polluting\n[1891.2s] corrupting influence of their life. Are\n[1894.2s] we together? If people would be\n[1896.4s] encouraged, if people would be\n[1898.4s] encouraged, the church in which they are\n[1900.8s] members and establish small humble\n[1903.3s] school buildings in which to do service\n[1905.9s] for God, they will accommodate their own\n[1908.3s] what? Children within their borders. Are\n[1912.0s] we together? I'm reading this and\n[1914.1s] somebody saying, \"Is this\n[1915.8s] possible?\" Hallelujah. It is possible\n[1918.6s] because God has said, \"Amen.\" Yeah, that\n[1923.0s] is possible because God has said, \"Do\n[1925.8s] you think God can give us such and God\n[1928.3s] doesn't give us a solution?\" Do you\n[1930.5s] think this reform God will leave us just\n[1933.5s] to No, it's only because we have not\n[1936.2s] taken a step a step. That is why we have\n[1938.4s] problems in the church. I know and I'm\n[1941.6s] sure that when we shall enter upon this\n[1943.8s] reforms with a willing heart, God will\n[1946.9s] stand for us. Are we together? So we are\n[1950.1s] told that if not more than six children.\n[1952.3s] So look at\n[1953.6s] that in localities where there's a\n[1957.0s] church a school should be established.\n[1959.7s] If there are no more no more than six\n[1963.1s] children to attend, a teacher should be\n[1967.4s] employed. Which should be employed? who\n[1970.4s] will educate the children in the truths\n[1972.4s] of the word of God which are so\n[1975.0s] essential for this last word last days\n[1977.8s] and which it is so important for them to\n[1980.0s] do what to understand a great test is to\n[1982.9s] doing what is coming it will be upon\n[1985.8s] obedience or disobedience to the\n[1988.6s] commandments of\n[1989.7s] God so decision must be\n[1992.4s] made a decision must be made now look at\n[1996.5s] this that is that was churches Where the\n[1999.9s] deceiver in churches we can have what\n[2003.4s] schools but look at this also this one\n[2006.0s] can also be done several churches unite\n[2009.1s] unite. Hallelujah. Several churches to\n[2011.8s] do what? Unite wherever there are few\n[2015.0s] Sabbath schools you know I know in this\n[2017.5s] information movements we are still\n[2019.5s] beginning that is a church where people\n[2022.2s] meet three are together three of them.\n[2025.2s] So we are told that whenever they refuse\n[2027.8s] what schools let the parents let who\n[2032.9s] parents unite together in providing a\n[2035.8s] place for\n[2037.4s] de school where the children of various\n[2040.5s] peoples can come together together.\n[2043.0s] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. And I know\n[2045.9s] I will be asking a class question. this\n[2047.8s] one I also need help but when we\n[2049.7s] establish schools when we establish\n[2051.7s] these schools I will be able to I'll\n[2053.8s] answer I'll ask that question to the\n[2055.4s] class because I need also help so these\n[2058.7s] parents should come\n[2060.3s] together and I know that even when\n[2064.3s] somebody was\n[2067.1s] yesterday because of the the message\n[2071.0s] they are what we call the parents of the\n[2073.7s] faith okay and therefore God has blessed\n[2076.7s] you\n[2079.7s] know that you have many children. Amen.\n[2082.3s] Parents who are\n[2088.0s] here parents by\n[2091.6s] hand get to understand that you\n[2096.4s] don't so many I'll be your\n[2100.2s] first look at this. So we are told let\n[2103.3s] them employ a Christian teacher who was\n[2106.9s] a\n[2108.0s] concentrated\n[2109.6s] missionary who who as a concentrated\n[2112.3s] missionary shall educate the children in\n[2115.0s] such a way to get them to become\n[2117.2s] missionaries themselves. Why? When it is\n[2120.6s] the day for the night, what when no man\n[2124.4s] can do what? We should have private\n[2127.5s] schools in different localities to\n[2130.6s] prepare our youth for our high what?\n[2134.2s] Schools. Are we together? We should have\n[2137.0s] what? Private schools. That is where my\n[2139.8s] question comes. I have I've been\n[2142.3s] struggling to know how this private\n[2144.5s] school can be done. I'm going to ask\n[2146.4s] that question to the class. Prepare an\n[2148.1s] answer. We should private schools. Amen.\n[2152.2s] I'm going very fast. Some we left out\n[2154.7s] and this private schools the following\n[2157.4s] are puppets to be\n[2159.3s] studied\n[2161.7s] schools because we say this look at this\n[2165.7s] look at this that\n[2173.7s] textbooks teachers method and break\n[2176.7s] principles principles but God has given\n[2179.0s] us everything everything is is in in is\n[2181.8s] in his word\n[2183.5s] is why amen. So after schools have been\n[2186.3s] established teachers should be pro\n[2188.5s] provided. Therefore the following should\n[2191.0s] be established the following should be\n[2193.3s] studied. I want somebody will be helping\n[2196.1s] me reading this quotation. I don't know\n[2198.6s] if you can open this open the place of\n[2202.8s] Bible the place of Bible you can be in\n[2207.3s] 124.

Then you read\n[2244.3s] you will be reading few statements to\n[2246.0s] explain because time my time is also\n[2247.9s] running so much. Are you there? Number\n[2250.2s] one. Number one\n[2253.9s] it says it says what shall we teach?\n[2257.0s] What shall we teach? What? Uh,\n[2259.8s] homeschool. Home school. The BI uh\n[2262.2s] number one. Number one, the Bible.

From this book.\n[2272.6s] From this book, parents are to give\n[2279.8s] instruction. I want to get something.\n[2282.5s] So, the first thing is the Bible. Just\n[2284.7s] copy this and be explaining the\n[2286.0s] following\n[2287.2s] bhani that is al another course of study\n[2290.3s] I'm going to explain while reading\n[2292.6s] simple\n[2293.8s] arithmetic accounting hallelujah simple\n[2297.2s] arithmetic what accounting children\n[2300.2s] needs to know simple\n[2302.1s] arithmetical accounting nature\n[2305.2s] physiology nature\n[2308.3s] physiology history stroke\n[2311.6s] prophecy\n[2313.2s] history stroke prophecy the\n[2316.5s] law the\n[2318.6s] law children must be taught the law the\n[2321.1s] law I'm going to explain that cooker\n[2324.9s] children must know to cook\n[2327.9s] amen same anatomy and physiology\n[2331.6s] children must understand anatomy as what\n[2334.8s] physiology physical\n[2337.6s] geography physical geography\n[2340.8s] hygiene must be\n[2345.3s] music. I'm waiting for the phone.\n[2347.4s] Somebody was telling me this phone.\n[2351.4s] You need your phone.\n[2353.9s] Not mine.\n[2355.6s] Good. Let us see.\n[2361.4s] Music literature. And in literature\n[2364.3s] there's spelling, reading, and writing.\n[2368.1s] And that one will deal with language.\n[2372.0s] Those ones\n[2381.8s] must directly\n[2385.3s] just say it. I find it crazy.\n[2388.2s] It\n[2389.4s] is go to place of Bible education just\n[2393.0s] go to what should be stud the schools\n[2394.8s] and they're just lying there. We shall\n[2398.0s] be reading each one the few steps we\n[2400.6s] explain because even these things are\n[2402.6s] also some of them are studied in popular\n[2406.1s] education but you see this how we need\n[2408.8s] to explain them to people so that people\n[2411.4s] get to understand what they shall be\n[2413.2s] teaching their\n[2418.8s] children should also be\n[2421.0s] taught missionary work should also be\n[2432.1s] will tell you that in this school\n[2433.8s] compound there should be a war. There\n[2436.2s] should be a what?\n[2438.8s] Amen. Where children learn to produce\n[2441.5s] their own\n[2442.4s] what? Hallelujah. So that that form\n[2445.6s] parts of their that form parts part of\n[2449.0s] their lessons. Let me read this to\n[2451.5s] explain the glory. Interesting.\n[2494.4s] So listen to this. I'm reading pamplet\n[2497.6s] 124 page 15 paragraph 3 says the\n[2500.6s] following\n[2502.0s] words 124 page 15 paragraph 3 says this\n[2505.6s] one I have to read no line of manual\n[2507.7s] training is of more value than\n[2510.0s] agriculture agriculture let the teacher\n[2512.6s] call attention to what the Bible says\n[2514.9s] about agriculture the study of let not\n[2518.6s] only theory but what practical I return\n[2522.2s] to simple\n[2523.6s] methods I return to simple methods\n[2525.7s] efforts will be appreciated by the\n[2528.5s] children and you work in the\n[2531.3s] garden and fail will be agree will be\n[2535.5s] agreeable change from the way some\n[2538.2s] routine of the abstract what lessons are\n[2541.5s] we together after the lessons about\n[2545.4s] even was teaching history and prophecy\n[2548.1s] what she take next is now agree\n[2550.7s] agriculture to hell that when people in\n[2553.9s] class they need to relax\n[2555.7s] Are you so compound there should be\n[2558.5s] a hallelujah? Those who desiring to\n[2561.8s] establish schools need to understand\n[2563.4s] this. Every school compound must be a\n[2567.4s] physiology should also be\n[2569.6s] taught. I don't want to read all these\n[2571.7s] things. I plan to read them and I plan\n[2573.9s] to read something in the place of the\n[2575.3s] Bible education but my time is running\n[2576.9s] so much. I\n[2578.4s] don't but I want us to see this 15\n[2582.2s] minutes. You know people ask questions\n[2584.4s] let me read this the following I'm\n[2586.1s] reading only this part of teachers\n[2588.6s] then because my time is up others also\n[2592.4s] somewhere I don't want to be somebody's\n[2595.1s] time my last class I'll be able to\n[2597.3s] analyze everything so we are told that\n[2599.4s] I'm not now talking about teachers we\n[2601.6s] have seen the topics to be studied in\n[2603.8s] education we have seen that the schools\n[2606.1s] must be established and we've seen the\n[2608.0s] solution how to establish schools\n[2610.4s] parents must have personal\n[2612.8s] responsibility. If there are few school\n[2615.3s] members somewhere, they can unite with\n[2617.1s] others to establish a what? School. And\n[2619.9s] I know it is possible because God has\n[2621.8s] saved. Amen. So it has been the custom\n[2625.1s] to encourage them. It has been the\n[2627.5s] custom to encourage sending children to\n[2631.1s] school when they were\n[2633.6s] more babies needing a mother a mother's.\n[2637.6s] Amen. That is what is happening today.\n[2639.9s] Parents should be they all be teachers\n[2642.1s] of their children until they have\n[2644.9s] reached age what? 10 years 10 years. So\n[2649.9s] first\n[2651.9s] responsibility until 8 or 10 years. Do\n[2656.4s] not send your little ones away to school\n[2659.1s] to\n[2660.1s] a mother should be careful how she\n[2664.2s] trusts the modeling of the infant mind\n[2667.0s] to other hands. Hallelujah. By the way,\n[2669.9s] the mother has a great responsibility in\n[2673.2s] teaching the child more than the the\n[2675.8s] father. The father also has a great\n[2678.2s] responsibility. But the mother's\n[2679.9s] responsibilities have high. Do you know\n[2682.9s] that is very very easy for a character\n[2685.8s] to be transmitted from the mother to the\n[2688.1s] child more than the\n[2691.2s] are the angel went to who? Samson's\n[2694.9s] mother. and is attracted how Samsung was\n[2698.2s] to be educated. So the mothers mothers\n[2701.4s] have a great responsibility. So parents\n[2703.5s] ought to be the best teachers of their\n[2705.5s] children until they have reached 8 or 10\n[2708.2s] years of age. So who's the best teacher\n[2709.8s] to the child at younger age?\n[2712.5s] Both best parents best but mother will\n[2716.6s] have great\n[2721.6s] responsibility.\n[2723.5s] Okay. Okay.\n[2726.1s] Let let me read this. Let me read this.\n[2728.3s] But both of them has a great\n[2737.0s] responsibility. Parents ought to be the\n[2739.0s] best teachers of their children until\n[2741.1s] they have reached 8 or 10 years of age.\n[2744.2s] Their school room should be what? Open\n[2748.2s] air and the flowers and back. Talk to\n[2751.9s] me. Just talk to me.\n[2754.8s] What is their school\n[2757.2s] room? Somebody just read that aloud.\n[2759.7s] What is their school\n[2761.6s] room? Open air\n[2766.4s] ams the treasures of nature. So we are\n[2771.0s] told about something here. I'm coming\n[2773.3s] back to that. But let me see the\n[2774.5s] qualifications of teachers who are teach\n[2778.1s] children in our schools. We are not a\n[2780.6s] special talent be given to the education\n[2783.5s] of the youth. The principles and habits\n[2786.2s] of the teacher should be considered of\n[2790.0s] greater importance than even is\n[2793.9s] literally qualifications. What should be\n[2796.8s] considered in a teacher? The principles\n[2799.6s] and hies of the teachers. Hallelujah.\n[2803.5s] Hallelujah.\n[2804.9s] If you are going to establish a school,\n[2806.4s] the first thing to look in the\n[2808.1s] principles\n[2810.1s] and not just teachers because they are\n[2813.3s] teachers\n[2826.7s] manipulation and knowledge in science to\n[2828.9s] instruct. One may have what? sufficient\n[2832.0s] educ education and knowledge in science\n[2835.2s] to do what? To instruct but has it\n[2839.2s] been orained that has tact and wisdom to\n[2845.0s] deal with the human what might mind. Are\n[2847.4s] we together? Those are qualifications.\n[2849.6s] Those who are deciding to establish\n[2851.0s] schools kindly write this. Let none feel\n[2853.8s] that let none feel that having an ear\n[2856.9s] honestness in religious matters is all\n[2859.9s] that is essential in order to become\n[2863.2s] when they need no less of piety. They\n[2865.6s] also need a par knowledge of what?\n[2868.3s] Science. Amen. So a knowledge of science\n[2870.9s] must be the teachers must have and their\n[2873.8s] habits and character must also be the\n[2876.6s] good. They should also qualify to be\n[2878.8s] dealing with minds. Amen. And in this\n[2882.2s] last days we need wise teachers because\n[2885.5s] people have so long been poverted by the\n[2887.7s] educational system. If somebody comes\n[2891.3s] self the teacher cannot deal with the\n[2893.6s] mind you will be having a problem in\n[2895.3s] that school that school\n[2898.4s] and I know the problem I know that there\n[2902.0s] people in teaching this God has placed\n[2905.6s] them here. It is only that you have not\n[2907.3s] recognized them or those abilities\n[2909.7s] belong to somewhere else. The good news\n[2911.5s] of God needs teachers who have a high\n[2913.4s] moral qualities and can be trusted with\n[2915.9s] education of others. Men who are of who\n[2918.9s] are sound in the in the faith and have\n[2921.4s] attacked and patient who walk with God\n[2923.8s] and abstain from every appearance of\n[2927.0s] what? Hallelujah. And abain from every\n[2930.4s] appearance of what? If you take a\n[2932.6s] teacher who cannot abstain from every\n[2934.9s] appearance of you will have a problem in\n[2936.9s] that school. Hallelujah.\n[2939.6s] Amen. Amen. So teachers who must go to\n[2942.1s] those schools must be a people who can\n[2945.0s] be able to abstain from every appearance\n[2946.9s] of all. I hope you are getting me. Who\n[2949.7s] stand so closely connected with God and\n[2952.8s] they can be channels of light in\n[2955.3s] Christian world. Gentlemen, we cannot in\n[2958.2s] this day apparel accept teachers because\n[2959.9s] they have been in school two 3 4 by 4.\n[2963.2s] Yes. Yes. The question we should decide\n[2966.1s] whether they are qualified for their\n[2967.6s] work should should be have they with all\n[2971.8s] their acquisition\n[2974.0s] acquisition of knowledge. sat and d\n[2977.0s] beneath the serpent of the true truth as\n[2979.4s] foren what treasure treasure are they\n[2982.6s] partakers of the fruit of the tree of\n[2985.7s] what life amen those are the\n[2988.5s] qualification of teachers so I'm coming\n[2990.7s] to the end of this because I have 10\n[2992.6s] minutes let me read this let me read\n[2996.3s] this let me read\n[2998.9s] this\n[3001.4s] mix what means seventh day adventist\n[3005.8s] Have plenty of what? Money. That is why\n[3009.1s] it it is possible to establish a what? A\n[3012.4s] school. Hallelujah. We have money. Amen.\n[3016.2s] How many are seventh\n[3017.7s] elementist? We have money. Hallelujah.\n[3021.8s] You can deny that you don't have money.\n[3023.9s] Amen. Seventh element have plenty of\n[3026.5s] what? Money. But it does not belong to\n[3029.2s] the what? Here's the problem.\n[3033.4s] We have money but that money doesn't\n[3035.4s] belong in the world. That is why we\n[3037.3s] don't one school as we speak. But we\n[3039.8s] have what? Money establish. We have\n[3042.9s] money that can run\n[3045.0s] gigs. But that money doesn't belong to\n[3047.7s] the king. This is the trouble. There is\n[3051.0s] a number among what they\n[3055.4s] advent to give an impetus to this\n[3058.2s] message to reach the one in the rest of\n[3061.0s] this world generation. If only that\n[3063.5s] money can belong to the church. There\n[3066.9s] are enough possibilities. Amen. Amen. If\n[3069.9s] we need text books, there are enough.\n[3071.9s] Amen. If we need\n[3075.6s] teachers, Hallelujah. There are enough\n[3079.2s] talents. Amen. They are teachers. Even\n[3081.6s] in this meeting, they are teachers who\n[3083.6s] qualify\n[3085.2s] teachers. There are enough\n[3088.4s] village. All the supplies that are ever\n[3091.3s] needed and all ever shall be needed. If\n[3094.6s] only those faculties, those talents,\n[3096.3s] those if only those facilities, this\n[3098.9s] talent, those faculties shall belong to\n[3100.9s] the what? The church. Hallelujah. This\n[3103.8s] is where it's a problem. And I know as\n[3106.3s] people will be looking, do you know\n[3107.9s] today we have\n[3112.3s] problem asking where this is the way for\n[3115.8s] what? You have money but that your money\n[3117.9s] doesn't belong to the church. The\n[3119.8s] church. Hallelujah. We are taking money\n[3122.0s] somewhere else. Amen. And we are told it\n[3126.0s] is a question one day. If my money\n[3128.3s] belongs to the what? The world. Do I\n[3131.0s] belong to the the I was to meet those\n[3134.3s] conditions but my time is up. If my\n[3136.8s] talines my abilities are put into the\n[3139.3s] work of the world as of the world and\n[3141.8s] not into the work of the church as of\n[3143.8s] the church then the question is worth\n[3146.1s] considering. Do I belong to the church\n[3148.8s] myself? Hallelujah.\n[3151.5s] I want to stop that point. The reason\n[3154.6s] why the church is failing to enter the\n[3158.6s] reason why we still have way forward. We\n[3161.0s] teach this truth and people are going\n[3162.5s] this way is that we have plenty of\n[3165.5s] money. We have plenty of means. We have\n[3168.9s] abilities and we have talents.\n[3171.0s] teachers I see a teacher looking\n[3177.7s] at the world the world not to\n[3181.2s] the Jones will ask you that if you are\n[3183.8s] satisfied in the world you belong to the\n[3187.4s] I know it is it is possible to end to do\n[3190.7s] everything that the Lord is calling us\n[3192.8s] to do what to do but only if we are\n[3196.2s] going to belong to the church the church\n[3198.4s] and parents\n[3200.1s] If we are going to commit that our mind\n[3202.1s] to the church then all these things we\n[3204.2s] shall be able to do what? May God help\n[3206.6s] us. Amen. May God help us to be church\n[3209.4s] members in Jesus name. Amen. Allow me\n[3212.0s] pray then I give time for questions.\n[3229.4s] We thank you dear father in\n[3231.6s] heaven for the solutions and\n[3234.6s] everything are clearly defined in your\n[3238.5s] word. The reason why this church has\n[3241.6s] failed is that all the talents and\n[3244.9s] abilities and faculties that are needed\n[3247.5s] to establish suits today we have plenty\n[3250.8s] of them but they belong the\n[3253.6s] world. Dear Lord in heaven is our\n[3256.0s] prayer.

        "full_transcript": "have to expand your brain and think broadly to do that for you to receive the seal of God, then you need to be established upon the truth that you cannot be moved. That is the sealing message. But now for you to be sanctified because the Bible says in John 17:17 that sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is what? Thy word is true. So men are sanctified by the word of God. But now brethren and sisters listen to the book of Maranatha page 231 is not in my slides. I told you that not everything is given in the slides. Many times you stand in the pulpit and God brings things for you to teach. But again you have to prepare for your lesson. Now the book of Marana page 231 if someone is there let me read 231 oh let's turn to paragraph number this is paragraph number four I think 231 paragraph 4 sure [Music] the tradication Now listen that true sanctification is a Bible word that's stop from there. Now what is true sanctification is Bible doctree. So until you understand the true Bible doctree you can be sanctified. What about if you don't understand what is true Bible doctree? It is very difficult for you to be sanctified. Now what says that true sanctification is a Bible docty. Then it says the Bible clearly teaches what sanctification is and how it is to be attained. Sanctify them through truth. Thy word is true. And Paul teaches that believers are to be sanctified by the word. Are you saying that is what I'm teach that believer and to be sanctified by who? By the Holy Ghost. What is believe that's a question that she asks? Jesus told when he speak personality when he is Christ a personality does Christ have a personality? Yes. Does Christ have a spirit, a body? Henceforth is a personality. Does God have a spirit? Does God have a spirit, a body? Yes, the person. What about angels? Does angels have spirit? A body. Hence, angels are apostles. What about the Holy Spirit? Does the Holy Spirit have a spirit? Now she says what is the work of the Holy Spirit? Jesus told his disciples when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into what John 16:3 I think now Jesus tell his disciples that when spirit of truth comes this spirit of truth will guide you into what what truth now brothers if we study the Bible and easy quotations. I've never seen where God has just sent the spirit itself to come and open the not to reveal to prophets or even apostles. And I think they have been looking about even William Miller who had led William Miller to study the Bible. You are looking never read. Let's turn to the Bali writings. Which page is that? Honey writings. Which page is that? I'm forgetting the page about William. Can someone check it? Oh, that's the story about William is in which page Think the teacher who was handling church heritage can help us. Is he around? Is he around? Let's check page 263. No, it is not page 263 page. It is page 81. Really? Let's see. 229. Yeah, sure. Page 229. Thank you. The quotation was like what? Yeah. Paragraph number one. It reads [Music] it. Now listen. Christ says one when he the spirit of truth is come he shall lead you into all what. Now listen when God is reliving uh revealing messages to this farmer called Miller. Now God is sending who? Who is God sending? But what did Christ say about the spirit of truth? That he will come and lead men into all truth. But now when I went right, he said that God sent his angel to move upon the heart of a farmer who had not believed the Bible to lead him to search the prophecies. Angels of God repeatedly visit visited that chosen one to guide his mind and open his understanding prophecies which had never been dark to God's people. The commencement of the chain of truth was given to him. Now when God reveals me to Luke, God send his angel. But now Christ says that when he the spirit of truth is come, he shall lead men into truth. But now here we see that who is leading Miller into the truth to study the scriptures and to open to him the Bible. Whom did God send? But Christ said that who was supposed to come? The spirit of what? The spirit of truth. Now you need to understand a close connection between the spirit and the angels. If you don't understand, then brother tell you you're going to be confused. Turn to the book of Ezekiel. The book of Ezekiel chapter number 11:4. Ezekiel Ezekiel chapter 11. The verse is verse 24. Now listen, let me begin from verse 4 first, then I jump to verse 24. Rather, the Bible says, \"Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, oh son of man.\" Then verse 5 says, \"And the spirit of the Lord fell upon me.\" Now listen, Ezekiel says, \"And the spirit of the Lord upon me and said unto me,\" how you explain that verse to a trinitarian who believe that there's a person called God the Holy Spirit and you believe that the spirit is not a person. Is that what you believe? That is what you believe. You don't believe in trinity. You believe that there's one God the father. Then Jesus Christ the son of God. Then you believe that this the spirit of God which is the spirit of the father and the son. But now the Bible says and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said unto me speak. Now who is saying? Who is saying it is the spirit saying? Do we understand that verse? Who is saying? Who is speaking in that verse? Who is speaking? Listen, I told you my English is not that broad. But understand what the Bible says. The Bible says, \"And the spirit of the Lord fell upon me and said unto me, who is speaking? And the spirit of fell upon me and said unto me and evangelist came to the pulpit and spoke to the church members who was speaking. It is another it is he that was speaking. Now when the of the fell upon me and he said who is speaking and the spirit of the Lord fell upon me said unto me speak the Lord. Who is speaking? Someone saying the Lord the spirit said that the Lord is reporting. Is that true? I know I'm speaking to men who have gone to universities and colleges and some of it from four and I've done I don't know linguistics and lage and what the Bible says spirit of the lord be upon me and said unto me speak the spirit speak the lord that have said oh house of Israel for I know the things that come into your mind everyone of them. Now brother, when you want to understand the Bible, I told you last time, you wish to look at the context of which the Bible is speaking because many of the trinitarians will use this part to prove you that the spirit is a person being turn to Ezekiel chapter 2, especially the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel chapter 2 verse number two. The Bible says, \"And the spirit entered into me and when he spake unto me and said me upon my feet that I heard him that spake to me another spirit. Which spirit was taking their prophets to vision? Which spirit was taking the prospect to vision? It's a question you have to ask yourself. Which spirit was that? Understand the book of revelation. Turn to your Bibles. Turn to your Bibles. I told you much of the Bible. The Bible as the only creed. You need to form your doctrine from the Bible. Brother and sisters, before you go to EG, understand what the Bible speaks. are written from the Bible. The book of Revelation chapter number 17. Let's begin from verse one. The Bible says, \"There came one of the seven angels which had seven vials and talked with me, saying unto me, come hither, I will show you unto thee the judgment of the great who that siteth upon many waters.\" Now he's coming to John here. Who has come to John? It is an angel. Then verse three says, so he who carried him in the spirit, it is an angel. Now the Bible says in verse three, so he carried me away in the spirit into death. So which spirit had carried John into the wilderness? Brethren, turn to the book of Hebrews. Is someone being confused? No, don't be confused. It is very simple. Turn the book of Hebrews, chapter 1:14. Hebrews 1:14. The Bible reads, the Bible says, \"And are they not all ministering?\" Oh, let's begin from verse 13. Says, \"But to which of the angel said he at any time, sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot?\" Then verse 14 says these angels still the Bible still speaks of these angels in verse 14. Are they not all ministering spirits? Now which spirit had carried Ezel to vision? It is angel. Thank you. How when Ezekiel said, \"And that spirit spake unto me, thus say the Lord, it was not the Holy Spirit that was speaking literally, but it was an angel speaking to who?\" To his angel, but now angels don't speak their own words, but they speak what belongs to the father. When they are endured with the Holy Spirit of them, angels don't come down with their own messages. They come down with what they had given from the father. Are we together? Now you have to you have to understand the context of the spirit in the Bible because someone will still confuse you. Let's take an example in the book of Isaiah chapter 59. You need to understand how the Bible explains itself. Turn to the book of Isaiah chapter 59 the vers number 19. It's a verse that many of us always read. The Bible say are you there? If you are there say amen. Are you there? You know some come to devotion without even carrying their Bibles. Now they stare at you. What is this man saying? Also some come to sleep. I'm not like the other. Look this boy is sleeping. Now the Bible says in verse 19 of chapter 59 of Isaiah. So are we there? The Bible says, \"So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and its glory from the rising of the sun. When the king shall come like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up the standard against what?\" Against him. the spirit of the Lord shall lift up the standard against him. Now the Bible says that that person that is going to lift up the standard against him is what the spirit. Now turn to the quotations of Eite in for a man. You understand how was explaining herself. If you want to understand quotations, this is the principles. Let the quotations be the key to unlock another quotation. Then stick firm on the Bible verse principle. Amen. The book form that is manuscript releases volume 4 page 158. Let's check page 158. Then I think it's paragraph 4. form that is manuscript releases volume 4 page 158 paragraph number four. Now listen the Bible says in Isaiah which read in 59:1 19 so shall they appear the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood. The spirit of the Lord shall lift up the standard against what? Against him. Now listen to what EG says. You place yourself in positions and in a society of those who bring temptation upon you. And that is why God is giving us messages of country living to go and stay far away from the cities. Who can be a Christian in the city? Who can be a Christian in the city? There's none. Can ever cheat yourself that you can be a Christian in the city? Very impossible. Now the Bible the says you place yourself in positions and in a society of those who bring temptation upon what? Upon you. And you do not always resist temptation. But the first decided resistant will bring angels your side to strengthen you. When you present your petitions to God for help, an angel lift up the standard for you against the enemy in order that you may not be overcome. Who is lifting? Who is lifting up the stand? Standards. But now Isaiah says when the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of what? The Lord shall lift up the standard against you. But now I says that when sister and brother and children who are listening to me when present petitions to God for help an angel was white drunkard were writing an angel. No are they not all ministering spirits. Now she says that when you present your petitions to to God for hell, an angel lift up the standard for you against what? The enemy in order that you may not be over overcome. That spirit that was taking the reference to see vision was angels. But now listen, as we come back to our laptops and projector that looked at yesterday, let's check this one here. Yeah, this one says that the great office work of what? The Holy Spirit is distinctly specified by our savior. Now, she says that it is the office work of the Holy Spirit. It is not the Holy Spirit itself. But this one is an office work. She speaks of an office work. Can I give you example? When governor says, I know many of you like crying for governors in your area. Then we tell the governor that governor is we vote for you and we know Christians should never take part in such things. But now just example man come and tell that man was saying that you go and vote. No even if you vote your vote will be of none effect to the governor. Now we start crying for the governor and tell the governor you know our place is leaking and we we need help from you. Then the governor says I will come and fix that thing. Then tomorrow he will see the governor wearing overall and gamuts and carrying hammers to come and fix it. Is that the thing? But the governor is going to send his office the delegates who are working with the name of that office. Is that true? Another example maybe those who work in the market places let me say like market the seages are everywhere then the governor says no don't worry brethren and sisters I will come and fix that thing but the governor says no just wait I will send my office there to fix what that thing are you with Thank you. Let me tell you another example. The president says literally the president seeing us but he says that I'm seeing you just miss there teaching things that are not there. I'm seeing you. Is the president seeing us? But why does he say he's seeing us? He has delegates in that office that are giving information to what? To him. Now she said that the great of his work of the Holy Spirit is distinctly specified by our savior and when he is come he will reprove the word of God. See Christ knew that this announcement was a wonderful truth to understand the great of his work of the holy spirit was a wonderful tool. So if you don't understand the of his work of the holy spirit then you are going to be lost. you are going to be still a trinitarian. He was nearing the close of his ministry upon this earth and he was standing in view of the cross with a full realization of the lot of guilt that was to be placed upon him as a sin bearer. Yet his greatest anxiety was for his disciples. He was speaking to find a solace for them and he told them nevertheless I will tell you the truth. It is expedient for me for for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you. But if I depart, I will send him what? And you remember quotation. No one can grab the spirit of what? Another. We want the Holy Spirit, which Jesus Christ. Listen, brethren, harmonizing the quotations to page 337, paragraph 1. Jesus comes to you as the spirit of truth. Study the mind of the spirit. Consult your lord. Follow his way. If you will to the dictates of the mind and flesh, your spirit will lose its proper character and balance. And if you fail to discern and cannot appreciate moral power, then you will seek to carry out the maxims of worldlings. Leave alone that. Check this one. Still harmonizing in sermons and talks volume 2 page 136 paragraph number six. The Lord says what this because he knows it is for our good. He will build a wall around us. The Lord will build what? A wall around us to keep us from transgression so that his blessing and love may be bestowed on us in rich measure. This is the reason we have established a school here. Listen, the Lord instructed us that this was the place in which we should locate and we have every reason to think that we are in the right what place. We have been brought together as a school. Now listen what she says that we have been together as what? As a school. Then we need to realize that the Holy Spirit who is what? As much a person as God is a person is walking through these what grounds unseen by human eyes. Now this person is walking in these grounds but unseen by what? Human eyes. That the Lord is our keeper and our helper. He hears every word we Christ says that he Christ only knows of four personalities. But now what? He says that the Holy Spirit is much a person as God is a person is doing what? He's walking. How? You need to understand how is some of you see this say where this thing was. No. She says that the Holy Spirit who is much a person as God is a person is walking through this what grounds and seen by what human eyes that the Lord is our keep and helper. He hears now again this Holy Spirit does a what a and he does what? He hears every word we are we utter and knows every thought of the m the mind. Are we together? Don't worry it is very easy to understand. Now listen again this quotation will bring confusion. She says in 7 BC 986 paragraph 10, all heaven is interested in our salvation. The angels of God are walking up and down the streets of these cities and marking the deeds of men. Now turn back to this quotation. She says that the Holy Spirit who is much a person as God is a person is working on what this grounds and think by human eyes that the Lord is our keep and helper. He hears every word we ut and knows every thought of the mind. Now listen to this one again. She speaks in review September 6 of 1890 that all heaven is interested in our salvation. The angels of walking up and down of these cities and matching the deeds of what? Now he's walking who is walking it is the Holy Spirit or angels. No no no brother told you not everything is the phone. That is the book H. I want to give you three quotations and then tell me who is walking. So that when you meet someone telling you you see what says the Holy Spirit who is imaging tell him no what about angels now how many people are walking on this earth. If Christ is walking angels are walking holy spirit is walking. Now when angels are walking, what is the work of the Holy Spirit and how is he working? Now turn to a minister of healing. Page 107. Page 107. This page 107 or 207? Let me check. 107 paragraph 3. Yeah, 107 paragraph number two. She says today no curious multitudes flock to the desert places to see and hear Christ. Are we together? That today no curious multitude flock to the desert places to see and hear who the Christ. His voice is not heard in the busy street. No Christ comes from the wayside. Jesus of passes by. She says yet this word is true today. Now listen brother and sister. Today no curious multitude flow to the desert places to see and hear what Christ his voice is not heard in the busy streets no Christ from the wayside Jesus of Nazareth passed by yet this word is true to them Christ walks and sin what what how many are walking now the Holy Spirit is working angels walking Christ walking unseen. How many are walking? Now prove how many are walking? How many are walking? Now listen. He says rather she yet this word is true today. Christ walks and seen through our street with messengers of merc. He comes to our homes with all who are seeking to minister in his name. He waits to cooperate. He is the He is in the midst of us to heal and to bless if we will receive him. Christ walking and sins, angels walking, the Holy Spirit is walking. Now brother, let me ask you a question. When Christ is walking, if Christ is walking, literally you say that he is walking, he's walking and sin, who is now pleading for us in heaven? Who will be pleading for us? If Christ comes down and start walking and you see he's walking here Christ is walking he's unseen. No, how is he walking? Turn to the book of Matthew chapter 25. Listen this I told you this is the most easiest topic to handle than even health. See health you need to study a lot of anatomy and physiology and look at bones and I don't know fibul I don't know synovial fluid no this is direct from the scriptures very easy to understand the book of Matthew chapter 25 are in Matthew chapter 25 then let's turn to verse 31 the bible says when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him. Then he shall sit upon the throne of his what? Of his glory. And before him shall be gathered all nations, and he shall separate them one from another as shepher divideth his sheep from the goats. Ask yourself, where do you want to belong? Sheep or goat? Sheep or goat? Sheep or goat? Sheep. Amen. Who is the lamb of God? Christ himself. Verse 33 says, \"And he shall take the sheep on the right hand on the right hand.\" So those who are going to be glorious and who are going to overcome sin will be upon the right hand of who? Of God. When Christ had overcome, where was he? Sitting at the right hand side of God. Verse 33 says, \"And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goat on the what? The left. Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of what? The world, for I was hungered and he gave me meat. I was thirsty and he gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. Listen, Christ is saying that you who are sitting on my right hand come this kingdom belongs to you from the foundation of the earth. Now he says that when I cry was done what? Was hungry and he gave me meat. When I was thirsty and he gave me drink. I was a stranger and he took me in. Naked and he clothed me. I was sick and he visited me. I was in prison and he came unto me. What Christ? What are you saying? You are in prison. Or do you think the saints will not be like what? Where were you in prison? In verse 37 he says then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when so we thee and hungered what Christ you were hungered somewhere one day I never saw you I think when sister will be there we'll be asking such a question what what are you saying Christ I thought you are bleeding for us in heaven and now you say you are and I've never seen anywhere and they will then they will say Then shall the Russian answer saying, Lord, when so we thee and hungered and fed thee all thirst and gave thee drink, when so we arrange and took thee in all naked and clothe thee, or when so the sick or in prison, and came unto thee, and the king shall answer and say unto them, verily, verily I say unto you, in as much as ye have done unto one of the least of these, my brethren, you have done it unto me. How is Christ walking? How is Christ walking? How is Christ walking? That if you have just done a charity work to someone who was in need, then that thing you did to who was Christ at that time walking? Yes. in the person of that person that you had to help. Turn to the book of Acts. I want you to understand. Turn to the book of Acts chapter 9. The book of Acts chapter 9. Are you in the book of Acts chapter 9? If you are there, say amen. The book of Acts chapter 9 verse number three says this is Saul and as he journeyied he came near Damascus and and suddenly there shine round about him a light from heaven and he fell on the earth and had a voice saying unto him soul soul why persecutest thou me? Who is speaking to Saul? Then Christ says, \"Saul, Saul, why was Saul chasing Christ with pangas and swords?\" Who was soul persecuting? Was Christ at that time walking on the grounds of earth? Was he walking? How? Through human agencies. Thank you, brother. You have used a nice English. through the human agency he was walking. Now he says, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou? Me?\" Now listen verse five. And he said, \"Who art thou, Lord?\" And the Lord said, \"I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.\" Now Jesus tells him, \"No, it is me who thou perse Christ.\" What we read this in the night when the teacher of prophets was presenting that Christ was persecuted in the person of what? His saints, his people. Was Christ walking? Yes. But now Christ was not walking literally from heaven. But those who are imbued by the spirit of Christ when we when they persecuted and those who persecute them are persecuting Christ himself. Because when we receive the spirit of Christ, it is now Christ dwelling in us. Now Paul says that it is not I that live but who liveth in me. Amen. Yeah. Paul says that it is not me that now live. But now that life that is in me is the life of who? Christ. Now when he persecuted that person is not persecuting because of me I no longer lives but now Christ lives in me and when he persecutes me he persecute the owner of the is Christ himself. Now says that that word is still true because Christ still walks and seen. He can walk and sin through the person of his saints. He can walk and sin through his ministers. Now when a minister comes to your home to visit you and then you chase that minister away, whom are you chasing away? Whom are you chasing away? And then one day Christ was telling you that you know one day I came to your home and you just chased me away or what Christ did you come to my home I never saw you. No Christ is with us still in the person of his people. When I'm speaking here, I'm not speaking I myself, but I'm speaking I'm representing Christ himself. Listen this. We read last time when trials overshadow the soul. Remember the words of Christ. Remember that his unseen presence in the person of what? In the person of what? The Holy Spirit. 16 paragraph 2 is some quotation that last time. While Jesus minister in the heavenly above, he is still by his spirit the minister of church on what? On earth. How is Christ with us? Through his spirit. Listen to 70 page 273 paragraph 1. As the divine endorment, the power of the Holy Spirit was given to the disciples. So it will today be given to all who seek a right. This power alone is able to make us wise unto salvation and to fit us for the courts above. Christ want us to Christ want to give us a blessing that will make us holy. These things have I spoken unto you says that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full. Joy in the Holy Spirit is healing. Giving lifegiving joy. In giving us his spirit, God gives us what is God giving us another God. But in giving us his spirit, God gives us what? himself. Now when we receive the spirit of God, we receive God himself. But now in the person of what? His spirit making himself a fountain of divine influence to give health and life to the world. Turn to the book of John chapter 14. I'm coming to the book of Acts. Then I finish up my study. My time is also coming to coming to an end. The book of which book? John chapter 14. Are you in chapter 14 of John? Yeah. Verse 23. The Bible says, \"Jesus answered and said unto them, if a man love me, he will keep what? My words. And my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our body with him.\" How is that possible? Will God the Father come and be in our stomachs? Then Christ also come and say in our stomachs. How are they with us? By the spirit. Even when it says by God giving us his spirit, God gives us what? Himself. That's the end of my study. Say amen. No. Turn to your Bible. That is not the end of my study. Turn to your Bible. in the book of okay the book of acts chapter 5 the last verse I think we'll continue the book of acts chapter 5 I wanted you to realize the connection between the holy spirit and angels amen so that you understand when I say that the Holy Spirit is much a person as God is a person is walking this grounds. Then another place he says that angels of God are moving up and down in our streets. Then what did she mean? We need to understand how does God brings blessings to us is something that we need to understand because there are some ministries who teach something that is very weird. You see our prayers goes to God through osmosis. You know what is osmosis? When you pray your prayers just go to God through osmosis. They just go. You know what is osmosis? Those who those who are privileged to reach from two from one it just moves slowly from where it is concentrated slowly. That is what people teach. Now listen to the book of acts 5:20. Then I finish up 5:20 says, let's begin from verse 19. But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said, who say? Who spake? The angel. He said what? Go stand and speak in the temple to the people or the words of what? Who is speaking there? Do you want to do you want to know what says about this verse? 1888 materials. Open 1888 materials. My last quotation 1547 paragraph 2. Now who is speaking here? But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said, \"Go stand and speak to the temple to the people all the words of this world. Who has just commanded these people to speak?\" The angels turn to 1888 materials. I've said which paid 1547 sorry paragraph number two listen brother sister she says but let us follow the history of the men whom the Jewish priests and rulers thought so dangerous because they were bringing in new and strange teaching on almost every theological subject that is the same as us today. You stand and teach people and people think that what what are you teaching that is not Adventism? See it says the command given by the Holy Spirit. What listen who gave the command in the Bible? But now in reports and tell us and she's not speaking her words but she's speaking what she's given by who? By God. She says the command given by the Holy Spirit, go stand and speak in the temple to the people. All the words of this life was obeyed by the apostles. Who gave the command? It is the Holy Spirit or the angel. Who gave the command? Who gave the command? Says the command was given by the Holy Spirit. The Bible says an angel. Now, how is that possible? How does the Holy Spirit speaks? I want to stop from there. How does the Holy Spirit walks and see? How does it speaks yet? It doesn't have a mouth and legs and hands. But the Bible says Egypt says and the Holy Ghost gave the command. We will still be looking at quotations in Egypt. There was a prophet in the book of verse called Agabas and the Bible has used him many times to explain how the holy spirit said but now may God help us understand as tomorrow we shall continue from there so we understand the office work of the holy spirit they are delegates who works in that office amen then don't believe some strange doctrines that our prayers goes to god through osmosis I don't know which ministry is that teaching that I've s ministries you know you just pray and your prayers come from the father through osmosis and then they are answered hey what's that man we shall look the ministration of all angels how do our prayers goes to the father you have to go back to Jacob's what Jacob's what learn and understand may God bless us all in Jesus name let's pray. We thank your precious father in heaven for this wonderful morning. We have opened thy word. You have led us. I myself am a weak vessel, not worthy to stand before thy people to present thy word. that because of thy mercies upon my life, you still grant me chances to teach thy word. How I pray that you help all of us God that indeed we need to know they are right and we need to be sanctified. We really facing much troubles as youths but this year you have called us to make a decision by our own self to serve thee. Help us to decide to serve thee as the only true God. Help us to decide that at the end of this convention, Father, we might go back and study our Bibles and understand who you are. Right? Give us the spirit of loving thy word. Give us the spirit of loving to study that father we may be build upon the platform of eternal truth. Thank you for the women who are kneeling down here, the men, the old men, the young men, the children. Give us strength, Father, that in these days of atonement, we might look upon our lives that where we are still not worthy, we may be afflicted and come to true repentance that Father, we may live a holy life. May you plant a spirit of hating sin in our life that we hate sin and don't love only righteousness. The duties of this day we commit upon your hand. Help us in everything. We know your presence is here and you are walking here with us. And each and every word we utter, each and every thought we we think of that is not worthy of thee, Father, we know you are noting them down through the ministration of the he angels. Help us to check our paths while thy spirit is leading us to only do the things which are right before thee. We pray that they will prevail as we are making decisions. Father, as youths, help us not to make decisions out of excitement of these truths. But help us to be convicted of the truth in the Bible. That as we come out of this convention, you may say that indeed this is the truth from the Bible. Because you know, after this, we are going to face persecutions. We are going to be separated from our friends. Those who are clinging upon are going to leave us and run away from us. But you know that when you are convicted of thy truth, we know that you are going to be with us. Guide each and every youth who is listening unto thy voice, the children. Father, help us. Provide for us ways. We know you promise us in the Bible that when we believe thy truth and when we are convicted of thy truth and decide to walk in the truth, you are going to provide ways for us to live in this earth. Let all prevail as we claim upon daily unto thy promises is our prayer by faith in Jesus holy name. Amen.",
        "timestamped_transcript": "[0.2s] have to expand your brain and think\n[3.2s] broadly to do that for you to receive\n[5.8s] the seal of God, then you need to be\n[8.9s] established upon the truth that you\n[11.0s] cannot be\n[12.1s] moved. That is the sealing message. But\n[15.4s] now for you to be sanctified because the\n[18.5s] Bible says in John\n[20.6s] 17:17 that sanctify them through thy\n[23.8s] truth, thy word is what? Thy word is\n[27.4s] true. So men are sanctified by the word\n[31.0s] of God. But now brethren and sisters\n[33.7s] listen to the book of\n[35.4s] Maranatha page 231 is not in my slides.\n[38.6s] I told you that not everything is given\n[40.6s] in the\n[41.5s] slides. Many times you stand in the\n[44.0s] pulpit and God brings things for you to\n[47.2s] teach. But again you have to prepare for\n[49.8s] your lesson. Now the book of Marana page\n[59.2s] 231 if someone is there let me read\n[66.5s] 231\n[69.8s] oh let's turn to paragraph number this\n[71.8s] is paragraph number four I think 231\n[74.9s] paragraph 4 sure\n[76.8s] [Music]\n[78.0s] the\n[79.6s] tradication Now listen that true\n[83.6s] sanctification is a Bible word that's\n[86.9s] stop from there. Now what is true\n[90.0s] sanctification is Bible doctree. So\n[93.2s] until you understand the true Bible\n[95.5s] doctree you can be\n[97.6s] sanctified. What about if you don't\n[99.9s] understand what is true Bible\n[102.8s] doctree? It is very difficult for you to\n[105.3s] be sanctified. Now what says that true\n[108.6s] sanctification is a Bible\n[111.7s] docty.\n[113.3s] Then it says the Bible clearly teaches\n[117.4s] what sanctification is and how it is to\n[119.4s] be\n[122.0s] attained. Sanctify them through truth.\n[125.4s] Thy word is true. And Paul teaches that\n[128.7s] believers are to be sanctified by the\n[133.6s] word. Are you saying that is what I'm\n[138.6s] teach that\n[140.8s] believer and to be sanctified by\n[143.8s] who? By the Holy Ghost. What is believe\n[149.0s] that's a question that she asks? Jesus\n[152.1s] told when he speak personality when he\n[157.5s] is Christ a personality does Christ have\n[160.5s] a\n[161.6s] personality? Yes. Does Christ have a\n[165.4s] spirit, a body? Henceforth is a\n[169.2s] personality. Does God have a\n[172.0s] spirit? Does God have a spirit, a body?\n[176.9s] Yes, the person. What about angels? Does\n[180.2s] angels have spirit? A\n[183.2s] body. Hence, angels are apostles. What\n[186.6s] about the Holy Spirit? Does the Holy\n[189.1s] Spirit have a spirit?\n[198.9s] Now she says what is the work of the\n[201.3s] Holy Spirit? Jesus told his disciples\n[204.2s] when he the spirit of truth is come he\n[207.4s] will guide you into what John 16:3 I\n[212.8s] think now Jesus tell his disciples\n[216.5s] that when spirit of truth\n[220.6s] comes this spirit of truth will guide\n[224.0s] you into what what\n[227.7s] truth now brothers if we study the Bible\n[232.0s] and easy quotations. I've never seen\n[235.2s] where God has just sent the spirit\n[238.0s] itself to come and open the not to\n[242.4s] reveal to prophets or even\n[246.3s] apostles. And I think they have been\n[248.3s] looking about even William Miller who\n[251.3s] had led William Miller to study the\n[256.8s] Bible. You are looking never read. Let's\n[260.4s] turn to the Bali writings. Which page is\n[262.2s] that?\n[268.8s] Honey\n[276.8s] writings. Which page is that? I'm\n[278.9s] forgetting the\n[281.2s] page about\n[285.6s] William. Can someone check it?\n[307.7s] Oh,\n[318.4s] that's the story about William is in\n[321.0s] which page\n[322.1s] Think the teacher who was handling\n[324.3s] church heritage can help us. Is he\n[326.2s] around? Is he\n[327.6s] around? Let's check page\n[335.3s] 263. No, it is not page\n[338.7s] 263\n[342.3s] page. It is page 81.\n[346.4s] Really? Let's see. 229. Yeah, sure. Page\n[350.2s] 229. Thank\n[351.5s] you. The quotation was like\n[355.6s] what? Yeah. Paragraph number one. It\n[359.0s] reads\n[362.9s] [Music]\n[364.2s] it. Now\n[366.0s] listen. Christ says one when he the\n[369.0s] spirit of truth is come he shall lead\n[372.1s] you into all what.\n[375.0s] Now listen when God is reliving uh\n[378.2s] revealing messages to this farmer called\n[380.9s] Miller. Now God is sending\n[383.7s] who? Who is God\n[386.0s] sending? But what did Christ say about\n[388.9s] the spirit of\n[390.1s] truth? That he will come and lead men\n[393.0s] into all truth. But now when I went\n[396.4s] right, he said that God sent his angel\n[398.6s] to move upon the heart of a farmer who\n[401.4s] had not believed the Bible to lead him\n[404.7s] to search the prophecies. Angels of God\n[407.9s] repeatedly visit visited that chosen one\n[411.0s] to guide his mind and open his\n[413.5s] understanding prophecies which had never\n[415.7s] been dark to God's people. The\n[418.5s] commencement of the chain of truth was\n[420.4s] given to him.\n[423.9s] Now when God reveals me to\n[427.7s] Luke, God send his\n[430.4s] angel. But now Christ says that when he\n[433.4s] the spirit of truth is come, he shall\n[435.5s] lead men into truth. But now here we see\n[438.4s] that who is leading Miller into the\n[440.4s] truth to study the scriptures and to\n[443.0s] open to him the Bible. Whom did God\n[447.2s] send? But Christ said that who was\n[449.5s] supposed to come?\n[453.0s] The spirit of what? The spirit of truth.\n[456.9s] Now you need to understand a close\n[459.9s] connection between the spirit and the\n[464.2s] angels. If you don't understand, then\n[466.6s] brother tell you you're going to be\n[467.8s] confused. Turn to the book of\n[470.3s] Ezekiel. The book of\n[473.9s] Ezekiel chapter number 11:4.\n[482.8s] Ezekiel Ezekiel chapter\n[487.0s] 11. The verse is verse\n[490.1s] 24. Now\n[492.0s] listen, let me begin from verse 4 first,\n[494.6s] then I jump to verse 24. Rather, the\n[497.2s] Bible says, \"Therefore prophesy against\n[500.9s] them. Prophesy, oh son of man.\" Then\n[504.1s] verse 5 says, \"And the spirit of the\n[507.3s] Lord fell upon me.\" Now listen, Ezekiel\n[511.5s] says, \"And the spirit of the\n[514.3s] Lord upon me and said unto\n[519.2s] me,\" how you explain that verse to a\n[522.7s] trinitarian who believe that there's a\n[524.3s] person called God the Holy Spirit and\n[527.2s] you believe that the spirit is not a\n[529.8s] person. Is that what you believe?\n[534.9s] That is what you believe. You don't\n[537.3s] believe in trinity. You believe that\n[539.6s] there's one God the father.\n[541.8s] Then Jesus Christ the son of God. Then\n[545.5s] you believe that this the spirit of God\n[548.2s] which is the spirit of the father and\n[550.7s] the son. But now the Bible says and the\n[554.2s] spirit of the lord fell upon me and said\n[557.9s] unto me speak. Now who is\n[562.9s] saying? Who is\n[566.0s] saying it is the spirit\n[568.7s] saying? Do we understand that verse? Who\n[571.2s] is saying? Who is speaking in that\n[573.2s] verse? Who is\n[575.6s] speaking? Listen, I told you my English\n[578.4s] is not that broad. But understand what\n[580.5s] the Bible says. The Bible says, \"And the\n[583.8s] spirit of the Lord fell upon me and said\n[586.2s] unto me, who is speaking?\n[594.3s] And the spirit of fell upon me and said\n[597.8s] unto me and evangelist came to the\n[601.8s] pulpit and spoke to the church members\n[604.6s] who was speaking. It is\n[609.6s] another it is he that was speaking. Now\n[612.9s] when the of the fell upon me and he said\n[616.5s] who is\n[620.8s] speaking and the spirit of the Lord fell\n[623.5s] upon me said unto me\n[626.9s] speak the Lord. Who is speaking? Someone\n[630.0s] saying the Lord the spirit said that the\n[634.5s] Lord is\n[639.8s] reporting. Is that true?\n[644.0s] I know I'm speaking to men who have gone\n[646.1s] to universities and colleges and some of\n[648.4s] it from four and I've done I don't know\n[651.0s] linguistics and lage and what the Bible\n[655.1s] says spirit of the lord be upon me and\n[658.1s] said unto me speak the spirit\n[662.4s] speak the lord that have said oh house\n[666.3s] of Israel for I know the things that\n[668.7s] come into your mind everyone\n[671.7s] of them. Now brother, when you want to\n[674.6s] understand the Bible, I told you last\n[677.3s] time, you wish to look at the context of\n[681.0s] which the Bible is\n[682.6s] speaking because many of the\n[684.6s] trinitarians will use this part to prove\n[686.7s] you that the spirit is a person\n[692.3s] being turn to Ezekiel chapter 2,\n[694.9s] especially the book of Ezekiel.\n[699.4s] Ezekiel chapter\n[701.8s] 2 verse number\n[706.4s] two. The Bible says, \"And the spirit\n[709.9s] entered into me and when he spake unto\n[713.2s] me and said me upon my feet that I heard\n[717.2s] him that spake to me another\n[721.8s] spirit. Which spirit was taking their\n[725.7s] prophets to vision?\n[728.1s] Which spirit was taking the prospect to\n[730.6s] vision? It's a question you have to ask\n[732.4s] yourself. Which spirit was\n[737.1s] that? Understand the book of\n[740.2s] revelation. Turn to your Bibles. Turn to\n[743.5s] your Bibles. I told you much of the\n[745.6s] Bible. The Bible as the only\n[748.4s] creed. You need to form your doctrine\n[751.4s] from the Bible. Brother and sisters,\n[753.5s] before you go to EG, understand what the\n[756.4s] Bible speaks.\n[759.2s] are written from the\n[761.6s] Bible. The book of Revelation chapter\n[764.5s] number\n[765.4s] 17. Let's begin from verse one. The\n[767.8s] Bible says, \"There came one of the seven\n[770.7s] angels which had seven vials and talked\n[774.4s] with me, saying unto me, come hither, I\n[778.0s] will show you unto thee the judgment of\n[780.3s] the great who that siteth upon many\n[783.1s] waters.\"\n[785.1s] Now he's coming to John\n[787.7s] here. Who has come to John? It is an\n[791.1s] angel. Then verse three says, so he who\n[795.4s] carried him in the\n[798.2s] spirit, it is an angel. Now the Bible\n[801.7s] says in verse three, so he carried me\n[804.3s] away in the spirit into death. So which\n[808.1s] spirit had carried John into the\n[811.0s] wilderness?\n[817.6s] Brethren, turn to the book of\n[819.7s] Hebrews. Is someone being\n[822.5s] confused? No, don't be confused. It is\n[825.0s] very simple. Turn the book of Hebrews,\n[827.3s] chapter\n[833.8s] 1:14. Hebrews 1:14.\n[837.4s] The Bible\n[839.1s] reads, the Bible says, \"And are they not\n[843.2s] all\n[844.3s] ministering?\" Oh, let's begin from verse\n[846.8s] 13. Says, \"But to which of the angel\n[849.9s] said he at any time, sit on my right\n[853.4s] hand until I make thine enemies thy\n[855.8s] foot?\"\n[859.0s] Then verse 14 says these angels still\n[862.0s] the Bible still speaks of these angels\n[863.8s] in verse 14. Are they not all\n[867.3s] ministering\n[869.1s] spirits? Now which spirit had carried\n[872.2s] Ezel to\n[873.8s] vision? It is angel. Thank\n[879.8s] you. How when Ezekiel said, \"And that\n[882.5s] spirit spake unto me, thus say the Lord,\n[885.2s] it was not the Holy Spirit that was\n[887.0s] speaking literally, but it was an\n[889.6s] angel speaking to\n[891.7s] who?\" To his\n[894.5s] angel, but now angels don't speak their\n[897.4s] own words, but they speak what belongs\n[900.3s] to the father. When they are endured\n[902.2s] with the Holy Spirit of\n[904.4s] them, angels don't come down with their\n[907.3s] own messages.\n[909.0s] They come down with what they had given\n[911.5s] from the\n[913.5s] father. Are we\n[916.1s] together? Now you have to you have to\n[918.4s] understand the context of the spirit in\n[920.3s] the\n[921.2s] Bible because someone will still confuse\n[924.5s] you. Let's take an example in the book\n[927.4s] of Isaiah chapter\n[929.5s] 59. You need to understand how the\n[933.2s] Bible explains itself.\n[936.4s] Turn to the book of Isaiah chapter 59\n[939.4s] the vers number 19. It's a verse that\n[941.4s] many of us always read. The Bible say\n[944.2s] are you there? If you are there say\n[947.3s] amen. Are you there? You know some come\n[949.7s] to devotion without even carrying their\n[951.4s] Bibles. Now they stare at you. What is\n[953.4s] this man\n[955.9s] saying? Also some come to sleep. I'm not\n[959.4s] like the\n[960.4s] other. Look this boy is sleeping. Now\n[963.8s] the Bible says in verse 19 of chapter 59\n[967.2s] of\n[967.9s] Isaiah.\n[969.4s] So are we\n[971.3s] there? The Bible says, \"So shall they\n[975.1s] fear the name of the Lord from the west\n[978.5s] and its glory from the rising of the\n[981.0s] sun. When the king shall come like a\n[984.1s] flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift\n[987.1s] up the standard against\n[989.0s] what?\" Against him. the spirit of the\n[991.9s] Lord shall lift up the standard against\n[994.8s] him. Now the Bible says that that person\n[998.2s] that is going to lift up the standard\n[1000.0s] against him is\n[1002.0s] what the spirit. Now turn to the\n[1005.4s] quotations of Eite in for a man. You\n[1010.1s] understand how was explaining herself.\n[1014.0s] If you want to understand quotations,\n[1016.9s] this is the principles. Let the\n[1019.4s] quotations be the key to unlock another\n[1024.3s] quotation. Then stick firm on the Bible\n[1027.1s] verse\n[1028.5s] principle.\n[1030.2s] Amen. The book\n[1032.4s] form that is manuscript releases volume\n[1038.7s] 4 page\n[1040.8s] 158. Let's check page\n[1044.3s] 158. Then I think it's paragraph 4.\n[1050.9s] form that is manuscript releases volume\n[1054.8s] 4 page\n[1057.3s] 158 paragraph number four. Now listen\n[1060.2s] the Bible says in Isaiah which read in\n[1063.4s] 59:1 19 so shall they appear the name of\n[1065.8s] the Lord from the west and his glory\n[1068.8s] from the rising of the sun when the\n[1071.1s] enemy shall come in like a flood. The\n[1073.1s] spirit of the Lord shall lift up the\n[1075.0s] standard against what? Against him. Now\n[1077.5s] listen to what EG says. You place\n[1080.0s] yourself in positions and in a society\n[1083.3s] of those who bring temptation upon\n[1085.9s] you. And that is why God is giving us\n[1088.4s] messages of country\n[1091.2s] living to go and stay far away from the\n[1093.9s] cities. Who can be a Christian in the\n[1096.4s] city? Who can be a Christian in the\n[1098.8s] city? There's none. Can ever cheat\n[1101.8s] yourself that you can be a Christian in\n[1103.1s] the city? Very impossible.\n[1106.2s] Now the Bible the says you place\n[1109.5s] yourself in positions and in a society\n[1112.2s] of those who bring temptation upon what?\n[1115.0s] Upon\n[1116.0s] you. And you do not always resist\n[1119.6s] temptation. But the first decided\n[1122.7s] resistant will bring angels your side to\n[1125.9s] strengthen you.\n[1128.2s] When you present your petitions to God\n[1130.5s] for help, an angel lift up the standard\n[1135.3s] for you against the enemy in order that\n[1138.7s] you may not be overcome. Who is lifting?\n[1141.8s] Who is lifting up the stand?\n[1144.3s] Standards. But now Isaiah says when the\n[1147.7s] enemy shall come in like a flood, the\n[1149.7s] spirit of\n[1150.8s] what? The Lord shall lift up the\n[1155.2s] standard against you. But now I says\n[1158.8s] that when sister and brother and\n[1161.1s] children who are listening to me when\n[1163.5s] present petitions to God for help an\n[1167.8s] angel was white drunkard were writing an\n[1171.7s] angel.\n[1174.0s] No are they not all\n[1176.9s] ministering spirits.\n[1180.0s] Now she says that when you present your\n[1182.4s] petitions to to God for hell, an angel\n[1186.2s] lift up the standard for you against\n[1189.4s] what? The enemy in order that you may\n[1192.1s] not be over\n[1194.9s] overcome. That spirit that was taking\n[1198.1s] the reference to see vision was\n[1201.2s] angels. But now listen, as we come back\n[1203.6s] to our laptops and\n[1205.5s] projector that looked at yesterday,\n[1208.0s] let's check this one here.\n[1210.2s] Yeah, this one says that the great\n[1212.3s] office work of what? The Holy Spirit is\n[1215.6s] distinctly specified by our savior. Now,\n[1219.1s] she says that it is the office work of\n[1221.7s] the Holy\n[1223.2s] Spirit. It is not the Holy Spirit\n[1226.0s] itself. But this one is an office work.\n[1228.5s] She speaks of an office work. Can I give\n[1232.1s] you example? When governor says, I know\n[1235.4s] many of you like crying for governors in\n[1237.2s] your area.\n[1239.8s] Then we tell the governor that\n[1242.4s] governor\n[1244.0s] is we vote for you and we know\n[1246.6s] Christians should never take part in\n[1247.8s] such things. But now just example\n[1250.0s] man come and tell that man was saying\n[1252.2s] that you go and vote. No even if you\n[1254.6s] vote your vote will be of none effect to\n[1256.7s] the\n[1257.8s] governor. Now we start crying for the\n[1260.5s] governor and tell the governor you know\n[1261.9s] our place is leaking and we we need help\n[1264.2s] from you. Then the governor says I will\n[1267.5s] come and fix that thing. Then tomorrow\n[1271.6s] he will see the governor wearing overall\n[1274.0s] and gamuts and carrying hammers to come\n[1276.6s] and fix it. Is that the\n[1280.2s] thing? But the governor is going to send\n[1282.6s] his office the delegates who are working\n[1286.5s] with the name of that office. Is that\n[1289.4s] true? Another example maybe those who\n[1292.2s] work in the market places let me say\n[1293.8s] like market the seages are everywhere\n[1297.6s] then the governor says no don't worry\n[1299.4s] brethren and sisters I will come and fix\n[1302.2s] that\n[1309.0s] thing but the governor says no just wait\n[1311.5s] I will send my office there to fix what\n[1315.0s] that\n[1317.6s] thing are you with\n[1325.5s] Thank\n[1326.4s] you. Let me tell you another example.\n[1329.1s] The president\n[1338.4s] says literally the president seeing\n[1342.9s] us but he says that I'm seeing you just\n[1346.2s] miss there teaching things that are not\n[1349.1s] there. I'm seeing you. Is the president\n[1352.2s] seeing\n[1353.2s] us? But why does he say he's seeing us?\n[1356.9s] He has delegates in that office that are\n[1359.4s] giving information to what? To\n[1362.6s] him. Now she said that the great of his\n[1366.4s] work of the Holy Spirit is distinctly\n[1368.5s] specified by our savior and when he is\n[1370.7s] come he will reprove the word of God.\n[1373.1s] See Christ knew that this announcement\n[1375.4s] was a wonderful\n[1377.3s] truth to understand the great of his\n[1379.9s] work of the holy spirit was a wonderful\n[1381.8s] tool. So if you don't understand the of\n[1384.1s] his work of the holy spirit then you are\n[1385.6s] going to be lost. you are going to be\n[1387.5s] still a\n[1390.4s] trinitarian. He was nearing the close of\n[1392.6s] his ministry upon this earth and he was\n[1395.2s] standing in view of the cross with a\n[1397.5s] full realization of the lot of guilt\n[1399.6s] that was to be placed upon him as a sin\n[1401.6s] bearer. Yet his greatest anxiety was for\n[1404.1s] his disciples. He was speaking to find a\n[1406.3s] solace for them and he told them\n[1408.4s] nevertheless I will tell you the truth.\n[1410.1s] It is expedient for me for for you that\n[1412.6s] I go away. For if I go not away, the\n[1415.3s] comforter will not come unto you. But if\n[1418.3s] I depart, I will send him what? And you\n[1421.4s] remember quotation. No one can grab the\n[1424.2s] spirit of what? Another. We want the\n[1427.6s] Holy Spirit,\n[1429.5s] which Jesus Christ. Listen, brethren,\n[1433.2s] harmonizing the quotations to page 337,\n[1435.8s] paragraph 1. Jesus comes to you as the\n[1438.2s] spirit of truth. Study the mind of the\n[1440.2s] spirit. Consult your lord. Follow his\n[1442.9s] way. If you will to the dictates of the\n[1445.6s] mind and flesh, your spirit will lose\n[1447.5s] its proper character and\n[1449.4s] balance. And if you fail to discern and\n[1451.9s] cannot appreciate moral power, then you\n[1454.4s] will seek to carry out the maxims of\n[1456.6s] worldlings. Leave alone\n[1458.8s] that. Check this one. Still harmonizing\n[1462.6s] in sermons and talks volume 2 page 136\n[1466.7s] paragraph number six. The Lord\n[1469.2s] says what this because he knows it is\n[1473.0s] for our good. He will build a wall\n[1475.5s] around us. The Lord will build what? A\n[1478.3s] wall around us to keep us from\n[1480.3s] transgression so that his blessing and\n[1483.2s] love may be bestowed on us in rich\n[1486.0s] measure. This is the reason we have\n[1488.0s] established a school here. Listen, the\n[1491.3s] Lord instructed us that this was the\n[1493.5s] place in which we should locate and we\n[1497.0s] have every reason to think that we are\n[1499.2s] in the right what place. We have been\n[1502.3s] brought together as a school. Now listen\n[1504.2s] what she says that we have been together\n[1507.0s] as what? As a school. Then we need to\n[1510.7s] realize that the Holy Spirit who is\n[1513.2s] what? As much a person as God is a\n[1516.6s] person is walking through these what\n[1519.5s] grounds unseen by human\n[1522.8s] eyes. Now this person is walking in\n[1525.3s] these grounds but unseen by what? Human\n[1528.1s] eyes. That the Lord is our keeper and\n[1529.7s] our helper. He hears every word\n[1534.0s] we Christ says that he Christ only knows\n[1537.6s] of four personalities. But now what? He\n[1540.3s] says that the Holy Spirit is much a\n[1542.1s] person as God is a person is doing\n[1544.4s] what? He's walking.\n[1546.8s] How? You need to understand how is some\n[1550.7s] of you see this say where this thing\n[1553.2s] was.\n[1555.1s] No. She says that the Holy Spirit who is\n[1559.2s] much a person as God is a person is\n[1561.8s] walking through this what grounds and\n[1564.7s] seen by what human eyes that the Lord is\n[1568.4s] our keep and helper. He hears now again\n[1571.1s] this Holy Spirit does a what a and he\n[1575.8s] does\n[1577.6s] what? He hears every word we are we\n[1581.8s] utter and knows every thought of the m\n[1585.4s] the\n[1588.3s] mind. Are we\n[1590.4s] together? Don't worry it is very easy to\n[1595.0s] understand. Now listen again this\n[1597.5s] quotation will bring confusion. She says\n[1600.7s] in 7 BC 986 paragraph 10, all heaven is\n[1604.6s] interested in our salvation. The angels\n[1607.3s] of God are walking up and down the\n[1610.3s] streets of these cities and marking the\n[1613.0s] deeds of men. Now turn back to this\n[1615.7s] quotation. She says that the Holy Spirit\n[1618.5s] who is much a person as God is a person\n[1620.7s] is working on what this\n[1624.6s] grounds and think by human eyes that the\n[1627.7s] Lord is our keep and helper. He hears\n[1630.1s] every word we ut and knows every thought\n[1632.6s] of the mind. Now listen to this one\n[1634.4s] again. She speaks in review September 6\n[1638.0s] of\n[1639.0s] 1890 that all heaven is interested in\n[1642.8s] our salvation. The angels of walking up\n[1646.6s] and down of these cities and matching\n[1648.7s] the deeds of what? Now he's\n[1652.2s] walking who is walking it is the Holy\n[1655.7s] Spirit or\n[1658.0s] angels. No no no brother\n[1661.8s] told you not everything is the phone.\n[1663.2s] That is the book\n[1665.1s] H. I want to give you three quotations\n[1668.1s] and then tell me who is\n[1672.4s] walking. So that when you meet someone\n[1674.8s] telling you you see what says the Holy\n[1677.8s] Spirit who is\n[1679.0s] imaging tell him no what about angels\n[1682.1s] now how many people are walking on this\n[1683.8s] earth. If Christ is walking angels are\n[1686.8s] walking holy spirit is walking. Now when\n[1689.7s] angels are walking, what is the work of\n[1691.2s] the Holy Spirit and how is he working?\n[1694.0s] Now turn to a minister of healing. Page\n[1700.2s] 107. Page\n[1703.9s] 107. This page 107 or 207? Let me check.\n[1708.2s] 107 paragraph\n[1710.6s] 3. Yeah, 107 paragraph number two. She\n[1715.8s] says today no curious multitudes flock\n[1719.2s] to the desert places to see and hear\n[1721.4s] Christ. Are we together? That today no\n[1724.6s] curious multitude flock to the desert\n[1726.5s] places to see and hear who the Christ.\n[1729.4s] His voice is not heard in the busy\n[1731.3s] street. No Christ comes from the\n[1733.8s] wayside. Jesus of passes by. She says\n[1737.9s] yet this word is true\n[1740.8s] today. Now listen brother and sister.\n[1744.0s] Today no curious multitude flow to the\n[1746.6s] desert places to see and hear what\n[1749.6s] Christ his voice is not heard in the\n[1752.2s] busy streets no Christ from the wayside\n[1755.8s] Jesus of Nazareth passed by yet this\n[1759.0s] word is true to them Christ walks and\n[1763.3s] sin\n[1765.2s] what what how many are walking\n[1769.3s] now the Holy Spirit is working angels\n[1773.0s] walking Christ walking unseen. How many\n[1776.2s] are walking? Now prove how many are\n[1780.3s] walking? How many are\n[1783.0s] walking? Now listen. He says rather she\n[1787.3s] yet this word is true today. Christ\n[1789.3s] walks and seen through our street with\n[1792.0s] messengers of merc. He comes to our\n[1794.1s] homes with all who are seeking to\n[1796.3s] minister in his name. He waits to\n[1798.3s] cooperate. He is the He is in the midst\n[1800.7s] of us to heal and to bless if we will\n[1803.7s] receive him. Christ walking and sins,\n[1807.2s] angels\n[1808.4s] walking, the Holy Spirit is walking. Now\n[1811.8s] brother, let me ask you a question. When\n[1813.8s] Christ is walking, if Christ is walking,\n[1817.4s] literally you say that he is walking,\n[1819.3s] he's walking and sin, who is now\n[1820.6s] pleading for us in\n[1824.7s] heaven? Who will be pleading for us?\n[1828.3s] If Christ comes down and start walking\n[1830.2s] and you see he's walking here Christ is\n[1831.8s] walking he's unseen. No, how is he\n[1839.1s] walking? Turn to the book of Matthew\n[1841.4s] chapter\n[1842.4s] 25. Listen this I told you this is the\n[1846.1s] most easiest topic to handle than even\n[1848.5s] health.\n[1850.1s] See health you need to study a lot of\n[1851.6s] anatomy and physiology and look at bones\n[1853.9s] and I don't know fibul I don't know\n[1857.0s] synovial fluid no this is direct from\n[1860.6s] the\n[1861.3s] scriptures very easy to understand the\n[1864.6s] book of\n[1865.6s] Matthew chapter\n[1869.0s] 25 are in Matthew chapter\n[1871.7s] 25 then let's turn to verse 31 the bible\n[1875.7s] says when the son of man shall come in\n[1878.3s] his glory and all the holy angels with\n[1881.2s] him. Then he shall sit upon the throne\n[1883.8s] of his what? Of his glory. And before\n[1887.7s] him shall be gathered all nations, and\n[1889.5s] he shall separate them one from another\n[1892.3s] as shepher divideth his sheep from the\n[1895.2s] goats. Ask yourself, where do you want\n[1897.2s] to belong? Sheep or\n[1899.2s] goat? Sheep or\n[1901.2s] goat? Sheep or goat? Sheep. Amen. Who is\n[1905.2s] the lamb of God? Christ himself. Verse\n[1907.4s] 33 says, \"And he shall take the sheep on\n[1910.0s] the right hand on the right hand.\" So\n[1913.3s] those who are going to be glorious and\n[1915.8s] who are going to overcome sin will be\n[1917.6s] upon the right hand of\n[1919.2s] who? Of God. When Christ had overcome,\n[1922.5s] where was he? Sitting at the right hand\n[1925.4s] side of God. Verse 33 says, \"And he\n[1928.0s] shall set the sheep on his right hand,\n[1930.1s] but the goat on the what? The left. Then\n[1934.1s] shall the king say unto them on his\n[1936.2s] right hand, come ye blessed of my\n[1938.1s] father, inherit the kingdom prepared for\n[1940.9s] you from the foundation of what? The\n[1943.3s] world, for I was hungered and he gave me\n[1946.3s] meat. I was thirsty and he gave me\n[1948.6s] drink. I was a stranger and you took me\n[1951.4s] in. Listen, Christ is saying that you\n[1954.8s] who are sitting on my right hand come\n[1956.6s] this kingdom belongs to you from the\n[1958.0s] foundation of the earth. Now he says\n[1960.2s] that when I cry was done what? Was\n[1963.1s] hungry and he gave me meat. When I was\n[1965.4s] thirsty and he gave me drink. I was a\n[1968.2s] stranger and he took me in. Naked and he\n[1970.8s] clothed me. I was sick and he visited\n[1973.1s] me. I was in prison and he came unto me.\n[1976.4s] What Christ? What are you saying? You\n[1979.2s] are in\n[1981.1s] prison. Or do you think the saints will\n[1983.2s] not be like what? Where were you in\n[1985.8s] prison? In verse 37 he says then shall\n[1989.8s] the righteous answer him saying Lord\n[1992.6s] when so we thee and hungered what\n[1996.0s] Christ you were hungered somewhere one\n[1998.6s] day I never saw\n[2000.0s] you I think when sister will be there\n[2002.4s] we'll be asking such a question what\n[2005.2s] what are you saying Christ I thought you\n[2007.3s] are bleeding for us in heaven and now\n[2008.9s] you say you are and I've never seen\n[2013.5s] anywhere and they will then they will\n[2015.8s] say\n[2016.9s] Then shall the Russian answer saying,\n[2019.1s] Lord, when so we thee and hungered and\n[2021.7s] fed thee all thirst and gave thee\n[2024.8s] drink, when so we arrange and took thee\n[2027.9s] in all naked and clothe thee, or when so\n[2031.0s] the sick or in prison, and came unto\n[2033.1s] thee, and the king shall answer and say\n[2035.4s] unto them, verily, verily I say unto\n[2037.0s] you, in as much as ye have done unto one\n[2040.3s] of the least of these, my brethren, you\n[2042.3s] have done it unto me.\n[2045.7s] How is Christ walking?\n[2050.9s] How is Christ\n[2054.0s] walking? How is Christ\n[2058.0s] walking? That if you have just done a\n[2061.8s] charity work to someone who was in need,\n[2065.7s] then that thing you did to who was\n[2068.6s] Christ at that time\n[2070.3s] walking? Yes.\n[2073.4s] in the person of that person that you\n[2075.1s] had to\n[2078.1s] help. Turn to the book of Acts. I want\n[2080.5s] you to understand. Turn to the book of\n[2081.9s] Acts chapter\n[2084.5s] 9. The book of Acts chapter\n[2091.0s] 9. Are you in the book of Acts chapter\n[2094.3s] 9? If you are there, say amen.\n[2097.6s] The book of Acts chapter\n[2099.6s] 9 verse number three says this is\n[2102.9s] Saul and as he journeyied he came near\n[2106.4s] Damascus and and suddenly there shine\n[2109.4s] round about him a light from\n[2111.3s] heaven and he fell on the earth and had\n[2113.9s] a voice saying unto him soul soul why\n[2116.1s] persecutest thou me? Who is speaking to\n[2120.6s] Saul? Then Christ says, \"Saul, Saul,\n[2124.1s] why was Saul chasing Christ with pangas\n[2127.3s] and\n[2129.4s] swords?\" Who was soul\n[2133.9s] persecuting? Was Christ at that time\n[2136.2s] walking on the grounds of\n[2138.5s] earth? Was he\n[2140.8s] walking?\n[2143.8s] How? Through human agencies. Thank you,\n[2146.2s] brother. You have used a nice English.\n[2149.3s] through the human agency he was\n[2154.7s] walking. Now he says, \"Saul, Saul, why\n[2157.6s] persecutest thou? Me?\" Now listen verse\n[2160.6s] five. And he said, \"Who art thou, Lord?\"\n[2163.2s] And the Lord said, \"I am Jesus whom thou\n[2167.2s] persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick\n[2169.8s] against the pricks.\" Now Jesus tells\n[2171.4s] him, \"No, it is me who thou\n[2173.9s] perse Christ.\" What we read this in the\n[2176.7s] night when the teacher of prophets was\n[2178.5s] presenting that Christ was persecuted in\n[2181.7s] the person of what? His saints, his\n[2186.1s] people. Was Christ\n[2188.5s] walking? Yes. But now Christ was not\n[2191.4s] walking literally from\n[2193.7s] heaven. But those who are imbued by the\n[2196.5s] spirit of Christ when we when they\n[2198.5s] persecuted and those who persecute them\n[2200.5s] are persecuting Christ himself.\n[2203.7s] Because when we receive the spirit of\n[2205.5s] Christ, it is now Christ dwelling in\n[2208.8s] us. Now Paul says that it is not I that\n[2212.2s] live but who liveth in\n[2217.6s] me. Amen. Yeah. Paul says that it is not\n[2221.6s] me that now live. But now that life that\n[2224.2s] is in me is the life of who? Christ. Now\n[2227.1s] when he persecuted that person is not\n[2229.5s] persecuting because of me I no longer\n[2231.2s] lives but now Christ lives in me and\n[2233.3s] when he persecutes me he persecute the\n[2235.2s] owner of\n[2236.0s] the is Christ\n[2239.8s] himself. Now says that that word is\n[2243.8s] still true because Christ still walks\n[2246.6s] and\n[2247.7s] seen. He can walk and sin through the\n[2250.4s] person of his saints. He can walk and\n[2253.0s] sin through his ministers.\n[2255.8s] Now when a minister comes to your home\n[2257.5s] to visit you and then you chase that\n[2259.4s] minister away, whom are you chasing\n[2262.2s] away? Whom are you chasing away? And\n[2265.0s] then one day Christ was telling you that\n[2266.4s] you know one day I came to your home and\n[2268.2s] you just chased me away or what Christ\n[2270.3s] did you come to my home I never saw\n[2272.7s] you. No Christ is with us still in the\n[2278.5s] person of his people.\n[2281.9s] When I'm speaking here, I'm not speaking\n[2283.8s] I myself, but I'm speaking I'm\n[2285.8s] representing Christ\n[2290.0s] himself. Listen this. We read last time\n[2292.5s] when trials overshadow the soul.\n[2293.8s] Remember the words of Christ. Remember\n[2296.0s] that his unseen presence in the person\n[2299.0s] of\n[2299.8s] what? In the person of\n[2302.3s] what? The Holy\n[2305.0s] Spirit. 16 paragraph 2 is some quotation\n[2307.8s] that last time. While Jesus minister in\n[2310.1s] the heavenly above, he is still by his\n[2312.2s] spirit the minister of church on what?\n[2314.6s] On earth. How is Christ with\n[2316.2s] us? Through his spirit. Listen to 70\n[2319.2s] page 273 paragraph 1. As the divine\n[2322.1s] endorment, the power of the Holy Spirit\n[2324.6s] was given to the disciples. So it will\n[2326.8s] today be given to all who seek a right.\n[2329.4s] This power alone is able to make us wise\n[2331.4s] unto salvation and to fit us for the\n[2333.8s] courts above. Christ want us to Christ\n[2336.8s] want to give us a blessing that will\n[2338.7s] make us holy. These things have I spoken\n[2341.0s] unto you says that my joy might remain\n[2343.3s] in you and that your joy might be full.\n[2346.6s] Joy in the Holy Spirit is healing.\n[2350.3s] Giving lifegiving joy. In giving us his\n[2354.0s] spirit, God gives us what is God giving\n[2357.7s] us another\n[2359.2s] God. But in giving us his spirit, God\n[2362.4s] gives us what? himself. Now when we\n[2365.7s] receive the spirit of God, we receive\n[2367.8s] God himself. But now in the person of\n[2371.0s] what? His spirit making himself a\n[2374.2s] fountain of divine influence to give\n[2375.8s] health and life to the world. Turn to\n[2378.2s] the book of John chapter\n[2380.8s] 14. I'm coming to the book of Acts. Then\n[2383.3s] I finish up my study. My time is also\n[2385.7s] coming to coming to an end. The book of\n[2388.0s] which\n[2389.0s] book?\n[2391.1s] John chapter 14.\n[2394.6s] Are you in chapter 14 of\n[2397.4s] John? Yeah. Verse 23. The Bible says,\n[2402.6s] \"Jesus answered and said unto them, if a\n[2404.9s] man love me, he will keep what? My\n[2407.5s] words. And my father will love him and\n[2409.9s] we will come unto him and make our body\n[2412.1s] with him.\" How is that possible? Will\n[2414.3s] God the Father come and be in our\n[2416.7s] stomachs? Then Christ also come and say\n[2419.0s] in our\n[2420.8s] stomachs. How are they with\n[2424.1s] us? By the\n[2426.5s] spirit. Even when it says by God giving\n[2429.2s] us his spirit, God gives us what?\n[2432.0s] Himself. That's the end of my study. Say\n[2435.2s] amen. No. Turn to your Bible. That is\n[2437.6s] not the end of my\n[2438.8s] study. Turn to your Bible.\n[2442.9s] in the book\n[2446.3s] of\n[2449.4s] okay the book of acts chapter\n[2452.3s] 5 the last\n[2454.6s] verse I think we'll\n[2457.3s] continue the book of acts chapter\n[2460.4s] 5 I wanted you to realize the connection\n[2463.7s] between the holy\n[2465.8s] spirit and\n[2467.7s] angels amen so that you understand when\n[2471.1s] I say that the Holy Spirit is much a\n[2473.9s] person as God is a person is walking\n[2475.5s] this grounds. Then another place he says\n[2478.4s] that angels of God are moving up and\n[2481.2s] down in our streets. Then what did she\n[2484.3s] mean? We need to understand how does God\n[2487.1s] brings blessings to us is something that\n[2489.9s] we need to understand because there are\n[2491.6s] some ministries who teach something that\n[2493.3s] is very\n[2494.5s] weird. You see our prayers goes to God\n[2497.8s] through osmosis. You know what is\n[2499.3s] osmosis? When you pray your prayers just\n[2501.7s] go to God through\n[2503.4s] osmosis. They just\n[2507.7s] go. You know what is osmosis? Those who\n[2510.7s] those who are privileged to reach from\n[2512.3s] two from\n[2514.9s] one it just moves slowly from where it\n[2518.2s] is concentrated slowly. That is what\n[2521.0s] people\n[2523.7s] teach. Now listen to the book of acts\n[2526.2s] 5:20.\n[2528.0s] Then I finish\n[2531.6s] up 5:20 says, let's begin from verse 19.\n[2535.4s] But the angel of the Lord by night\n[2537.0s] opened the prison doors and brought them\n[2540.0s] forth and said, who\n[2542.7s] say? Who spake? The angel. He said what?\n[2547.9s] Go stand and speak in the temple to the\n[2550.8s] people or the words of what? Who is\n[2554.1s] speaking there? Do you want to do you\n[2556.9s] want to know what says about this\n[2560.5s] verse? 1888\n[2565.6s] materials. Open 1888 materials. My last\n[2570.2s] quotation\n[2572.9s] 1547 paragraph 2. Now who is speaking\n[2576.4s] here? But the angel of the Lord by night\n[2579.0s] opened the prison doors and brought them\n[2581.0s] forth and said, \"Go stand and speak to\n[2584.5s] the temple to the people all the words\n[2587.8s] of this world. Who has just commanded\n[2590.6s] these people to\n[2591.9s] speak?\" The angels turn to 1888\n[2595.5s] materials.\n[2597.4s] I've said which\n[2601.6s] paid 1547\n[2604.7s] sorry paragraph number two listen\n[2608.3s] brother sister she says but let us\n[2611.4s] follow the history of the men whom the\n[2614.1s] Jewish priests and rulers thought so\n[2616.0s] dangerous because they were bringing in\n[2618.4s] new and strange teaching on almost every\n[2620.6s] theological subject that is the same as\n[2622.7s] us today. You stand and teach people and\n[2625.0s] people think that what what are you\n[2626.8s] teaching that is not\n[2629.8s] Adventism? See it\n[2632.6s] says the command given by the Holy\n[2635.7s] Spirit. What listen who gave the command\n[2639.0s] in the\n[2640.3s] Bible? But now in reports and tell us\n[2644.0s] and she's not speaking her words but\n[2646.6s] she's speaking what she's given by who?\n[2650.6s] By God. She says the command given by\n[2654.0s] the Holy Spirit, go stand and speak in\n[2656.2s] the temple to the people. All the words\n[2658.1s] of this life was obeyed by the apostles.\n[2660.7s] Who gave the\n[2661.9s] command? It is the Holy Spirit or the\n[2664.7s] angel.\n[2670.6s] Who gave the\n[2673.4s] command? Who gave the command? Says the\n[2676.2s] command was given by the Holy Spirit.\n[2677.5s] The Bible says an angel. Now, how is\n[2680.0s] that possible?\n[2687.0s] How does the Holy Spirit speaks? I want\n[2689.7s] to stop from there. How does the Holy\n[2692.2s] Spirit walks and see? How does it speaks\n[2695.2s] yet? It doesn't have a mouth and legs\n[2697.0s] and hands. But the Bible says Egypt says\n[2700.9s] and the Holy Ghost gave the command. We\n[2704.6s] will still be looking at quotations in\n[2706.3s] Egypt. There was a prophet in the book\n[2709.0s] of verse called Agabas and the Bible has\n[2713.1s] used him many times to explain how the\n[2715.5s] holy spirit said but now may God help us\n[2718.4s] understand as tomorrow we shall continue\n[2720.9s] from there so we understand the office\n[2724.1s] work of the holy spirit they are\n[2725.6s] delegates who works in that office amen\n[2729.4s] then don't believe some strange\n[2731.0s] doctrines that our prayers goes to god\n[2733.0s] through\n[2734.0s] osmosis I don't know which ministry is\n[2736.1s] that teaching that I've s ministries you\n[2738.6s] know you just pray and your prayers come\n[2741.4s] from the father through osmosis and then\n[2743.0s] they are answered hey what's that\n[2745.2s] man we shall look the ministration of\n[2747.7s] all angels how do our prayers goes to\n[2750.6s] the father you have to go back to\n[2752.1s] Jacob's\n[2753.3s] what Jacob's what learn and understand\n[2757.2s] may God bless us all in Jesus\n[2762.1s] name let's\n[2776.0s] pray. We thank your precious father in\n[2778.6s] heaven for this wonderful\n[2781.1s] morning. We have opened thy word. You\n[2783.5s] have led\n[2784.4s] us. I myself am a weak\n[2787.5s] vessel, not worthy to stand before thy\n[2790.0s] people to present thy word. that because\n[2791.5s] of thy mercies upon my\n[2793.4s] life, you still grant me chances to\n[2797.1s] teach thy word. How I pray that you help\n[2800.2s] all of us God that\n[2801.9s] indeed we need to know they are right\n[2805.3s] and we need to be\n[2807.8s] sanctified. We really facing much\n[2810.0s] troubles as youths but this year you\n[2812.9s] have called us to make a decision by our\n[2815.0s] own self to serve thee.\n[2817.8s] Help us to decide to serve thee as the\n[2820.6s] only true\n[2821.7s] God. Help us to decide that at the end\n[2824.3s] of this convention,\n[2825.9s] Father, we might go back and study our\n[2828.5s] Bibles and understand who you are.\n[2830.9s] Right? Give us the spirit of loving thy\n[2834.0s] word. Give us the spirit of loving to\n[2837.5s] study that father we may be build upon\n[2840.1s] the platform of eternal truth. Thank you\n[2842.7s] for the women who are kneeling down\n[2844.0s] here, the men, the old men, the young\n[2845.7s] men, the children. Give us strength,\n[2849.2s] Father, that in these days of atonement,\n[2851.3s] we might look upon our lives that where\n[2854.6s] we are still not worthy, we may be\n[2856.7s] afflicted and come to true\n[2859.3s] repentance that Father, we may live a\n[2861.5s] holy life. May you plant a spirit of\n[2864.3s] hating sin in our life that we hate sin\n[2866.5s] and don't love only righteousness.\n[2868.9s] The duties of this day we commit upon\n[2870.7s] your hand. Help us in everything. We\n[2873.5s] know your presence is here and you are\n[2875.5s] walking here with us. And each and every\n[2878.3s] word we\n[2879.5s] utter, each and every thought we we\n[2883.1s] think of that is not worthy of thee,\n[2884.9s] Father, we know you are noting them down\n[2886.6s] through the ministration of the he\n[2888.9s] angels. Help us to check our paths while\n[2891.6s] thy spirit is leading us to only do the\n[2894.7s] things which are right before thee.\n[2897.1s] We pray that they will prevail as we are\n[2899.4s] making decisions. Father, as\n[2901.3s] youths, help us not to make decisions\n[2903.8s] out of excitement of these\n[2906.0s] truths. But help us to be convicted of\n[2908.6s] the truth in the\n[2910.4s] Bible. That as we come out of this\n[2912.6s] convention, you may say that indeed this\n[2914.4s] is the truth from the Bible. Because you\n[2916.9s] know, after this, we are going to face\n[2918.6s] persecutions. We are going to be\n[2920.4s] separated from our friends. Those who\n[2923.0s] are clinging upon are going to leave us\n[2925.4s] and run away from us. But you know that\n[2928.3s] when you are convicted of thy truth, we\n[2930.5s] know that you are going to be with us.\n[2932.7s] Guide each and every youth who is\n[2934.2s] listening unto thy voice, the children.\n[2936.9s] Father, help us. Provide for us ways. We\n[2940.2s] know you promise us in the Bible that\n[2941.8s] when we believe thy truth and when we\n[2944.5s] are convicted of thy truth and decide to\n[2946.3s] walk in the truth, you are going to\n[2947.6s] provide ways for us to live in this\n[2949.3s] earth. Let all prevail as we claim upon\n[2952.3s] daily unto thy promises is our prayer by\n[2955.1s] faith in Jesus holy name. Amen."

If you want to see that amusement are dangerous then there are things associated with amuse amusement things associated with modern dance. that the Bible says that it is not that dance that David did with reverence and awe but this of today's modern what modern dance see the things associated with modern dance first Corinthians verse five it says with many of them God was not pleased God was not pleased with they died in the wilderness These things were written for us so that we should not last after evil things as youth as they also lasted. Many were idolatrous. As for some of them, it is recorded. Listen to this. The people sat down. sat down. They eat and do what? Then do you know what they did after sitting, eating and drinking? And after playing. After playing, do you know the next thing that they did? The young men. Do you know the next thing that follows? After sitting, eating, then drinking, then they rose to play. Do you know the next thing? What did they do? The next verse says that it says that neither threeiction let us commit. You are let us it says neither let us commit fornication. Oh just read it says neither neither [Music] let us that English is not penetrating okay so the people what I wanted to pick is that the people sit down to eat and do what then after drinking they committed what so that is the youth so today amen They said, they eat. After eating, they rose to do what? Then Adventist Adventist on page 524 that thing is explained. Paragraph one says that no AH 524.1. [Music] It says that like the Israelites Like like the Israelite of the old write that that the bless eat and did what? Eat and drink. Then they rise up to play. There is me and so that is not the dance that David did. It is called the modern what where people just laugh. There is Smith. There is Joe. DJ DJ DJ DJ. Is that David dancing? How many have those things? Hey, I'm talking to people who are Christians. How many have been in this earth? How many have those things? Just read.

These evils just read these evils. The greatest evil of it. Repeat that. Write that. That the greatest evil of this amusement of today. The greatest evil of this amusement all. Permanent. It is what? What is permanent? That is why today youths are so awkward. Paragraph that follows says paragraph number two. It says that not the time the probation of the earth is closing. Those who are in the times of Noah, they just make themselves in amusement and festives. Those who possess the influence and power were bent to keep the minds of the people. How many are attending parties party after party? How many have ever attended this class? You know people are fine. People are not talking. How many are attending? So these things were in the anti-olivian world. They were the things that make sure that only Noah was saved. Amen. The minds of the youth. How many youth were saved in such a time? How many youths? None. Why? Parties after and songs and amusement and dancing. The devil ensure that these things fill them up. And Noah when Noah was preaching I read something in Ages page 91 says that Noah invested all everything he had in the building of the ark. As he was building the ark he was pre but you know what the world gave back to Noah. They were saying that Noah is a deluded what? A deluded fanatic. Somebody has been just bewitched misled and what bewildered. Now in this in this our life today what is going to make us get lost is the amusement of the world. Amen. Going to excite youths to the places. Just read as you conclude. It says that read write that how many are seeing the same are being repeated in our day. Do you not see the same repeated in our day? While God's servants are giving the message that these things that the end of all things is at hand, the world is absorbing amusement and the pleaser seeking. There is a course of round excitement that causes amusement. Then the people are being prevented from being impressed by the truth. They were really doing according to the Lord's will. Young Sabbath keepers. A nice group here. Unbelievable. And who have yielded to the influence of the world alive that he might be the one. We'll have to be tested and what? So we must be tested and watches whether we are going to stand when the world is following the world or the church is trending back to what Egypt. Amen. While the youths are trending back to they must be tempted and be proved whether their minds are interested in music. They are charm with music or they want to be intelligent spies and what studios that are going to give the last message to this what just read I want you to go to the last thing I'm reading then I just stop continue it says the peril of the last days are upon us the trial is upon the young which they have not anticipated. The young must be brought into this distressing perplexity the genuiness. Amen. The truthfulness of their faith will be what? We are going to be tried and proved. How many find themselves dancing? They when they hear instrumental music just find yourself dancing without How many have ever How many this people in the grace? How many? Okay. You you are going to be tested. Amen. And approved and the genuiness of the genuiness will be read. It continue to says you know youths today profess to be looking for the son of man. Some of us are a bad example to unbelief. Read they have not been willing to give up the They are not been willing to give up the That is why even if I make a call, how many have songs in their phones that are not to the glory of God? We are not willing to give up the we just want to live as the world. Then we are going to preach. We are going to be cut off. Amen. We are going to lose eternity. By the way, L White says in messages to young people page 108.1 that death before dishonor is the motive of every I rather die than to than to sin. That should be our what? Continue reading. It says that it continued by saying they have not been willing to give up the world what is picnics united in the world in attending what is that eh or you you go and check on that they have been united enjoying them the world to attend what picnics X. Mhm. Uh-huh. Read. Uhhuh. They united with what? With the world. Mhm. Just pause. Let us conclude with this book. Jun says that it's better not to sing than to spend much time in singing songs that are not worthy to the glory of God. Amen. It is better to study than to sing. It is better to spend your mean in singing means in singing than in means in preaching than in singing. Testimony volume 1 page 676 paragraph 1 that is the last quote I'm reading says that but if you go and read you write evangelism page 5 11 write that you go and read for your own self 511.1 Ellen White says that singing should not take the hour of prayer and studying of the so if you are not a Bible student do not expect to sing songs that will glorify God. Amen. Much of your times should not be spent in singing, but you don't study. You will not have power over the amusement of the world. Amen. The Bible and the Bible alone is what is going to make us the world. Amen. Testimony volume 1 page 676 paragraph one says, I'm reading a case of this. This woman is called who? Anna Smith. Annie Smith. Yeah. Read read what is written there. I want to conclude. It says it says I that is Ellen White. I spoke to the large congregation. Before we went eastward, people neglected sister Mo. I saw of the duty of giving honor to whom it is due. It appeared to me that wisdom has so departed that they were not capable of appreciating the moral work. I told like I'm telling this church today that there were many among them they were they could they could find time to to mix to to meet. Uhhuh. Just read to meet and sing. They could find time to meet and sing and play their instrumental what? Music. They could give their money to the artist to to produce their photos. They could find money to give the artist to produce their what? photos to meet to sing just it continue by saying they should give money to their artist to multiply their likenesses and they could spend their money to attend public what public amusements they had nothing to give to the the work of what missionary just read it continue to says it continue to say it's Philadelphia and what do we know about they had nothing to give out to a worn out missionary who had embraced the present truth Philadelphia was a church where there was no rebuke and he has come to live with those of like faith I advised them to stop and consider what they were doing and proposed that they shut up their instrument of music. I told them to stop. They leave down their instrument of what? Of music. Music for 3 months for 3 months and take time to humble themsel before God in self-examination. So if you are going to spend time singing and amusement but we don't have money to give to the work what is the advice you stop we stop what selfexamination so music should not take part of prayer and studying of the bible amen amen says that much time should be spending studies more than because what the youth must must decide for himself reuke is to cut loose the world to do away with pleasant to talk about it. There's no and decide for eternity. Amen. We are not only going to follow the ways of the world that we are we are not going to fall again but we want to serve the Lord. So nice says that with one eye single to the glory of Christianity nowadays it's the glory of we wanted to be may God bless us in Jesus. Some place it's better. In our place it's medium and in some places really bad. So, um, is there a comment, a question? [Music] [Music] When you see how [Music] young because some of them cannot understand and some of them what they hear I listen to. Thank you. Is there another person? So let us just conclude as we pray. She drums bit we just include there is no wrong in use of instrumental music but that says that you need to exclude what drum beat there are instrumental music we can use like the h the trim rail the guitar etc but with the drummen Yes. [Music] What about the things we had like when we sing? That is the question. Like Who can answer that? Cuz you can answer that. I don't know how to answer this song, right? But it's I would say basically it's illegal to add your own stuff already used by permission. If you see it's written by you compose your own story. [Music] Thank you [Music] for creating distortion. So here is really [Music] Sir, let us just pray. God, pray with us as we pray. Will you kneel down as we pray? Holy and precious Lord oures. Thank [Music] you. The condition is going to be closed.

The Bible and the Bible alone is\n[1015.0s] what is going to make us the world.\n[1017.7s] Amen. Testimony volume 1 page 676\n[1022.8s] paragraph one says,\n[1027.4s] I'm reading a case of this. This woman\n[1029.9s] is called\n[1031.9s] who? Anna Smith.\n[1035.0s] Annie Smith. Yeah. Read read what is\n[1037.4s] written there. I want to conclude. It\n[1038.9s] says it says\n[1042.7s] I that is Ellen White. I spoke to the\n[1044.7s] large congregation.\n[1048.8s] Before we went eastward,\n[1055.3s] people neglected sister Mo.\n[1061.7s] I saw of the duty of giving\n[1064.4s] honor to whom it is\n[1070.1s] due. It appeared to me that wisdom has\n[1072.8s] so departed\n[1079.4s] that they were not capable of\n[1081.0s] appreciating the moral\n[1084.4s] work. I told like I'm telling this\n[1087.5s] church\n[1089.7s] today that there were\n[1092.0s] many among\n[1095.1s] them they were they could they could\n[1098.0s] find time to\n[1101.2s] to\n[1103.0s] mix to to meet. Uhhuh.\n[1106.9s] Just read\n[1109.4s] to meet and sing.\n[1114.8s] They could find time to meet and sing\n[1116.9s] and play their instrumental what? Music.\n[1123.0s] They could give their money to the\n[1125.9s] artist\n[1129.4s] to to produce their photos. They could\n[1131.7s] find money to give the artist to produce\n[1133.6s] their what? photos to meet to sing\n[1139.4s] just it continue by saying\n[1144.2s] they should give money to their\n[1147.5s] artist to multiply their\n[1153.1s] likenesses and they could spend their\n[1155.5s] money to attend public what public\n[1158.5s] amusements\n[1163.6s] they had nothing to give to the the work\n[1166.0s] of what\n[1168.9s] missionary just read it continue to says\n[1172.8s] it continue to say it's Philadelphia and\n[1176.2s] what do we know about they had nothing\n[1177.9s] to give out to a worn out missionary\n[1182.3s] who had embraced the present truth\n[1185.0s] Philadelphia was a church where there\n[1187.0s] was no rebuke and he has come to live\n[1190.6s] with those of like faith\n[1195.4s] I advised them to stop and consider what\n[1198.1s] they were doing and proposed that they\n[1201.4s] shut up their instrument of music. I\n[1204.0s] told them to stop. They leave down their\n[1206.1s] instrument of what? Of music. Music for\n[1209.0s] 3 months for 3 months and take time to\n[1211.7s] humble themsel before God in\n[1213.3s] self-examination. So if you are going to\n[1215.5s] spend time singing and amusement but we\n[1218.7s] don't have money to give to the\n[1221.2s] work what is the\n[1224.0s] advice you stop we stop what\n[1226.8s] selfexamination so music should not take\n[1229.4s] part of prayer and studying of the bible\n[1232.6s] amen amen says that much time should be\n[1235.4s] spending studies more than\n[1239.4s] because what the youth must must decide\n[1241.8s] for himself reuke is to cut loose the\n[1245.4s] world to do away with pleasant to talk\n[1248.3s] about it. There's no and decide for\n[1250.1s] eternity. Amen. We are not only going to\n[1252.6s] follow the ways of the world that we are\n[1254.6s] we are not going to fall again but we\n[1256.3s] want to serve the Lord. So nice says\n[1258.9s] that with one eye single to the glory of\n[1261.1s] Christianity nowadays it's the glory of\n[1263.7s] we wanted to be may God bless us in\n[1265.8s] Jesus. Some place it's\n[1268.4s] better. In our place it's medium and in\n[1271.8s] some places really bad. So, um, is there\n[1276.6s] a comment,\n[1278.5s] a question?\n[1292.6s] [Music]\n[1301.5s] [Music]\n[1304.0s] When you see\n[1306.9s] how\n[1310.2s] [Music]\n[1318.7s] young because some of them cannot\n[1321.3s] understand and some of\n[1322.9s] them what they hear I listen\n[1327.1s] to.

I don't know how to\n[1414.1s] answer this song, right?\n[1417.7s] But it's I would say basically it's\n[1422.0s] illegal to add your own\n[1425.7s] stuff\n[1433.3s] already used by permission. If you\n[1436.6s] see it's written\n[1443.1s] by you compose your own story.\n[1458.4s] [Music]\n[1478.6s] Thank you\n[1481.3s] [Music]\n[1491.5s] for\n[1505.4s] creating distortion.

All these things concerning me make known to you shall Takius the beloved brother a faithful what? You know Paul says Takius is a faithful minister. You know I've been working with my fellow young evangelist. we've been having with ministers.

Amen. Somebody tell us will come and when he comes what will tasers do? Everything he's faithful he will tell you everything about me. You know these things make me sad today. Imagine do you trust any minister when he goes somewhere and what he's going to speak about your name? Do you even trust me when I've gone somewhere? Do you think somebody will say Maxwell faithful will tell you everything you just very what faithful minister to minister so in this room do you think somebody can send you and say so and so is faithful and when he comes everything you want to know about me I don't have a problem he will tell you you is not my sermon verse number eight whom I did send unto you this very thing that he might know the things concerning you and might comfort your hearts he's coming to know things he he recommends strikers very faithful he's coming and he will know things concerning but what will he do to you comfort verse number onimas now he goes to the second one who the faithful and beloved brother who is of you all things to you shall they make known that are here even on is also with you know Colossians 4:7 talks of ministers whom Paul worked with one is Tus very faithful man number two very what faithful look look at verse number 10 salute you do Aris my fellow captive and Marus the nephew of Anabas who is a nephew a nephew is sister. Amen. And if you is what a son to your brother or sister like I have here that is my nephew. So I thank God the gospel people had relatives. Why didn't you say amen?

Do you know the one who preached to them? The second born who took the message preached to God. And then the last one. Hallelujah. You don't even have any plan. Praise God. Check with me. The Bible [Music] says salute you to my fellow captive and Marus the nephew of Barnabas. So who was Marus the nephew? So Barnabas was a man who encourages I hope you know what Barnabas used to do. He even took the the the son to the what they either sister or a brother there and they were with him in the ministry. Why don't you say amended as a family you know I was in kissing during revival week of prayer and I found I was so much happy with elder ke all the sisters even the ones who are old walks like this I want to go and be he took the message to all the sisters and I loved that and I was so much challenged that what are my sisters can they also be with us. Some of us are here do not think of their brothers and sisters. They preach to people's brothers. They preach to people's mothers but they don't think that their mothers also need to be one true God believers. Amen. Barnabas knew that that is a work that must be done even to the relatives. And some of us think that this message is only meant for you. You don't even share that word. You give people papers but you don't remember your brothers. You give people documents and you think they your brothers will go to heaven and because you just love them because you given How many have ever thought that you don't think about them but listen who you I'm seeing another person called Jesus verse number 11. Are you seeing him Jesus called the name Jesus was a common name called the reason why Jesus again you know you can imagine living with Jesus in the house. Hallelujah. Yes. And Jesus is called justice who are the circumcision. These only are fellow workers who reign of God who did become comfort to me. So which people comforted Paul? These fellow workers they confronted Paul when Paul was in a problem. Please can we have such workers in this last days that we can be a comfort to one another. But if you have a problem you say I want to mention them. Belot Venus also brothers you have a sister also. So I will talk about that one next time. Nelson, James, those are the only brothers. You know when the Bible says those are the only what that means other brothers did not comfort. I don't want to go to that one. Verse number salute you do a father who is of you a servant of Christ always striving for you in what? Prayer. So there's a prayer band member here. I called you. What is a furnace doing? striving, praying on behalf of arms. Praise God. There were people during the time of Paul that were striving. You know the word striving, that means that person is a prayer warrior. I don't know if that is the name striving. Praise God. But there's a man the Bible mentions is striving for others. Praying on behalf of others striving for prayers in behalf of what others are you even you know I was looking at this box. This boxing nothing completely in this box. This is a prayer box. You mean prayer box? You cannot even struggle even make a prayer request for a brother that surely god I have a friend I want to write his name that even if he's not here God may use any to reach him look at the box people do not have prayers which prayers which prayers do we need to have we don't have look at this box even your mother if you don't have a friend does your mother love god but you have why don't you have tried alone since you love this others who like who like what say he can drive on behalf of you. Paul says there are others salute to you do epas who of you are servant or always driving for you in what in the prayers they are in this meeting and people refuse. Honorable brother relative even even a brother to your father so that may strive on their on if our relatives will get lost they will get off because you refuse that a parents cannot do what pray for you there were prayer warriors who are driving on behalf number one by the way Before I go to this, it says always striving for you in the prayers. That you may what? Stand perfect and made fully the will of what? God. There were people during the time of Paul that their work was to pray for God's people to stand what? In the will of who? God. Hallelujah. Verse number 13. Are you there with me? Say amen. For I do testify to him that he has much zeal for you and those inia and those inolish. Meaning this person had a zeal. The zeal he had for the people of God. He was a zeal that he want them to be saved. His desire was to see. Do we have mothers? I'm sorry that our mothers all are outside. They are not here. who were even praying for people that their work is to see even young men even preachers to be saved confirms that I'm aware this person prays hallelujah this person is striving for us please let me ask you what are you known for can people say that surely we know so and so is praying on my behalf are you aware if you are going for miss there's a people praying for me. I know they might not be with me here but they are striving but even if you have a prayer request you can call please kindly kneel down and pray on my behalf. Do you know why we meet problems and we disturbed there are people who have refused to pray for us but can talk that minister that minister is that prayers? Hallelujah. This woman I don't know if if it's a man or a woman. I don't know. Is a what? Three. What is he that people is that what perfect? Is it to see a people perfect church perfect ministers that are not perfect? Paul says he testify that he had much zeal in those prayers. He prays for those in he prays for those in. And then he finishes by saying salute you Dr. Lucas. You know when he say salute to you in it says medical. Hallelujah. In Paul's ministry there were medical missionaries physicians. Hallelujah. And the Bible says that salute Lucas the beloved one. Paul love Luke. Why Luke when his sick was like Rolex walking with remedies. Amen. That ministry was full. You know today I've just seen a message that there's a church here. 57 members were brought [Music] district and do you know why Satan is using such a people they will say the churches are like this the devil is so busy in fact it's in the news I've placed it in the group you can check it and see the stories so dangerous stories so people can think but that is not that is how the devil but devil will not make it Christ has defeated the devil in heaven in the cross in the garden of Eden Christ will still lead praise God there was a beloved physician this man is called who I'm seeing here I'm seeing belat here medical missionary in the room I'm seeing you here I we are with in fact Paul says we are with Lucas the beloved Not. And then he says, \"And and not.\" So when Paul is writing the book of Colossians, he says, \"They're with Lucas and they're with who?\" They're with Demas. So how many people were there when letter was written? Two were next to what? Paul, who who are they? Lucas and who? Demos. Praise God. Lucas and who? Let me give you some of the verses where the name of Deas is mentioned. Uh, can I give you those verses? Filimon 124. The Bible reads, \"Mus Lucas, my fellow workmen, are you there in Philippians? Please check it. Check it. My time is only 7 minutes and I'm praying.\" Philon 1 verse 24. The Bible says, are you seeing it? Musles. And who? Uh-huh. My fellow. So Paul mentions his fellow what? Paul was not working alone. Listen, in this work, you must have fellow workers. I know that there are times that the work was too tough. I told you the other time that there's a time that John Mark had to leave the work. Hallelujah. Because the work was tough. But Paul always had fellow workers. Even at the time they were with Barnabas, they had to separate. They also met challenges the way we do. Hallelujah. Phil, not Philippians. Please speak in a little tone. Hallelujah. Fleon 1 24 confirms not only in the book of Colossians but says Marus and his demas Lucas my fellow what? Work men. My fellow what? Workmen. Workmen. I also see I also see the name of uh this man written again in 2 Timothy 4:10. For Demas had forsaken me. Deas has done what? Having loved the present. In fact, there's a verse says having loved the present age and is gone to Thessalonica to Galatia Titus to Dalmatia. Praise God. A fellow workman with Paul when they were writing letters preaching with Paul and fellow Aman. Do you know the book of Filimon is written to somebody who had you know who was that? The book of filmon is written to a man called who? Onesimus. And did you see the name of Onesimus? Onimus came back and joined Paul. Paul made him a very you know what did Onesimus do in the book of filmon verse number one to three. Let me say there is the Bible says the Bible reads the Bible reads Paul Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and of Jesus Christ and Timothy our brother Timothy our brother and to Filon our dearly beloved and fellow laborer and to our beloved Afiah and Aibus our fellow soldier our fellow soldier the church in thy house the church in that so in the filimon's house there was a what church. Uhhuh. Grace to you. Grace to you and peace from God our fatherh the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I thank my God. I thank my God. Making mention of thee always in my prayers. Depends on you. Always in my word. Yes. There was a church in the house for those who think that they cannot leave big churches. There was a church in the house of filmon. Hallelujah. He always and he tells I remember that church my friend. Read very fast. It says, \"I thank my God, making mention the always in my prayers, hearing of my of thy love and faith, yes, which thou has towards the Lord Jesus, to all the saints, that the communication of thy faith may become effectual, and the knowledge of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. For we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the poed by thee brother might be much bold in Christ to enjoy thee that which is convened convenient yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee being such an one as Paul the aged and now also prisoner of Jesus Christ I beseech thee for my son ones I beseech you for my what my son ones my son what ones the bible whom I be bonds. Uh-huh. Which in time past, Uhhuh. was to thee unprofitable. Or in the time what? Pass. Was to thee what? Unprofitable. Profitable. So that means ones and lived with who? Filament. And he said ones and profitable in the time what? Read the Bible. It says it says I receive thee for my son. Yes. whom I beg my bones which in time pass was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me. Hallelujah. Never think only that made profitable. Even so Paul made Onesmas what profitable Onesimus was chased by servant I will come back to that sermon again I will come not now imagine today I'm saying deas is when letter is written 1 vers 24 he sees being returned back to the work having left hallelujah he was seeing it he was When Paul used to go and preach, he used to be sent when people had convention like this. He was a speaking there were the let me go to conflict and carry 349 paragraph 2 says 349 conflict and carry says among assistants at home were many of his former companions and fellow workers. Luke the physician was with him still. Dus and Mark were also with him. So which people were with him? Luke many commissioners. Mark and with who? See the early years of his profession of men. Mark Christian experience had deepened as he had studed more closely the life of death and death of crimes. He had obtained clear views of the savior's mission. it toils and conflicts reading in the scars scars and increase hands and feet. The marks of Israelis for humanity and the right in which selfis had become willing to fight the master in the back of what? Self sacrifice. Self what? Sacrifice. Mark came back and saw Mark coming back. Das saw Mark leaving the work and brought again to work again. When somebody leaves the work, he has never seen Jesus the way he should see Jesus. Hallelujah. When somebody leaves the work, he has never seen the scars of Jesus Christ who suffered for the world humanity. Mark came back. We are told now sharing the lot of Paul the prisoner, he understood better than ever before that it is infinite gain to win Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. infinite laws to win the world and lose the soul from whose redemption the blood of Christ was shed. In the face of severe trial and adversity, Mark continued steadfast and a wise and beloved helper of the apostle. Why don't you say amen? When Mark came back, he now understood somebody can go home so that when he comes back, he may be strong. All things work together for what? for those who love one and are called according to his word. Praise God. When Mark came back, he was stronger and he became an help of Paul. Why don't you say amen? But now was there seeing the condition what ste for what afterward forsook in referring to this Paul wrote them as forsaken having love this present 2 Timothy 4:10 for anyone please I'm praying For what every word for them butter exchange those who do not know the word butter it means exchanging in traditional African society. If you have a sheep, somebody has got me you do what he noble. How many? How shortsighted be exchange? power. Yes. Possessing only one word. Well, honor deas was a poor ill might proudly call his home while Mark choosing to suffer for Christ's sake possess what being accounted in heaven and what I joined her with his words. Hallelujah. church them has left because of Christ. They must left the work having preached. Please do you know the verse in verse 27 Paul says that I bring my body under what subjection I want this body to understand. I want to control this body that having preached to others I may not be what a time came Dema said this gospel is very tough. You know sometimes you may say you know I can preach with the word but do you know today young men you know Demas was a young person and he went back to Thessalonica. Do you know it is Thessalonica whereby when Paul preaches people are making noise. Do you know it is Thessalonica whereby Paul says that the people of B are not the people like the people of why with them they they wrote these things down and later on they went to do what? This man goes to Thessalonica where by the people were not serious. Why? World again. How poor was Deas milk accepted to suffer for Christ sake. Imagine this quotation says that Deas was poor indeed. However much he might proudly call his own. I have a cup. You know, you cannot just walk for God barefooted. Today I have a car. Do you have a motorbike? You see, you you don't joke. You know, walking for God. You see Hallelujah. Don't look at me. This could say was pouring and however much he might proudly call his words on that now things don't we have today people who do not people who do not understand the sacrifice of Jesus and having preached having suffered having walked in the path humiliation they leave the gospel work and join things so that they may have things called the word and they proudly walk say I cannot walk in a way where I cannot get anything I cannot suffer. Paul in fact Mark choosing to suffer for Christ sake possess it all being accounted in heaven and of a joint hair with his son if you permit our mind to dwell more upon Christ and the heavenly world. We should find a powerful stimulus and support in fighting the battle of the Lord. Why would you say amen? If we can only be in Christ, we can be encouraged. Even if we see the brethren we used to have are now having good big houses, good safets and you if you go to your room you have nothing. You have old mattress and people tell you because you are walking walking walking for the go walking walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walking walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk was poor indeed today those who are poor indeed with big houses with big vehicles poor indeed can love people because they don't have anything amen left the work to go and get worldly riches hallelujah Praise God. It finishes by saying pride and love of the world. Why don't you say amen? Uhhuh. The glorious better so soon be our home. Beside loveliness of Christ all attraction will seem of little work. Hallelujah. I'd rather have Jesus 327 to say mommy to say mommy please I'm encouraging my fellow young men while is coming to this work I told you about lot while is coming please I'd rather 327 327 please please please Das was proud he had things he was proud he had moved bag. He had a vehicles. He had a big good house. He had a suit. And he was telling Mark, \"Who you wake up and a few clothes?\" Do you know if you read the Bible, Paul only had few clothes? Paul didn't have enough Zeus. That is 2 Corinthians 11. You will go and read at home. Hallelujah. And he said, \"No, he cannot make us.\" Number 3:27. Let's sing it. This is Mark singing this song while Demas is proud that he has things. The way today people are proud, we are proud of things we have and we can laugh others and think that those people are lost. They are not good gospel ministers because they lack things that the world have. Hallelujah. But how poor indeed Mark was rich because he has chosen to suffer for the sake of Christ. Hallelujah. 27 [Music] Jesus [Music] is Jesus. [Music] by his heart to be king of our [Music] men in great stus for [Music] I rather Jesus than I rather than the faithful to the I mean than to be the king of our [Music] ra before you go to number three I cannot pray ministers were in the gospel field who are like Mark who sometimes have drawn back and God has given you opportunity ministers who are in the field doing God's work but people tell you my brother please look at this side until you forget suffering and even people even tell you how you will suffer when you follow that course that the Lord has convicted you in his word that it is the cause of Christ but people tell you no no no you see you must have this and when even look others how they have become rich because they have chosen that side you also say in your heart surely I think that is the way but you want to be steadfast in Christ and you want Christ to help you please come forward come forward we pray come forward as we sing number three I want to pray with those who want to be gospel workers and the world promises you good things but you want God to help you know you may think Demas was demas was also a minister like we are but you have seen his name being mentioned fellow servants but he left and that must repeat itself now because they were written for us. Number three is fairer than leaves of red rest blue is sweeter than honey from out the angering spirit reach. I rather ask Jesus and let him lead than to be the king over them. I rather have Jesus than this world. Dear Lord in heaven, I want to thank you so much for allowing me present this evening. Thank you so much for the message. Time is too short and soon and very soon we will be going home. We have seen Paul with his fellow servants who were once [Music] faithful. We have seen Mark coming back to the ministry and accepting Jesus Christ as his personal savior. accepting to suffer, accepting to be poor in the worldly goods which are being seen but rich in heavenly goods which are not seen. Dear Lord in heaven, Dembas chose the world. The spirit of prophecy has confirmed he would have glorified himself with the things he had but he was poor indeed. As we speak, the world is presenting for us goods. a blouse of men. Men are saying please don't waste time in the gospel work. Paul was a missionary just walking to and fro having few clothes didn't have enough things didn't have peace and people are telling young men don't walk like this old you will have nothing to eat. The same messages are being repeated to minister today in the field and some are choosing side. Some are busy in the internet looking people for from abroad to give them money so that they may have good houses, good lands. They may have the upper house of men, good suits. But dear Lord, some are even entering into the worldly businesses which do not glorify your name because they want to have goods of this world. How poor indeed was. But how was Mark? These people are asking you to help them together with myself. Help us to be like Mark found grace in your sight to come back to your work. We pray in Jesus holy name. God bless you.",

So who was Marus the nephew?\n[670.5s] So Barnabas was a man who encourages I\n[673.2s] hope you know what Barnabas used to do.\n[675.5s] He even took the the the son to the what\n[678.3s] they either sister or a brother there\n[680.2s] and they were with him in the ministry.\n[682.1s] Why don't you say\n[683.3s] amended as a family you know I was in\n[686.0s] kissing during revival week of prayer\n[688.2s] and I found I was so much happy with\n[690.2s] elder ke all the sisters even the ones\n[692.6s] who are old walks like this I want to go\n[695.1s] and\n[696.0s] be he took the message to all the\n[704.4s] sisters and I loved that and I was so\n[708.2s] much challenged that what are my\n[710.4s] sisters can they also be with us. Some\n[713.3s] of us are here do not think of their\n[714.9s] brothers and sisters. They preach to\n[716.6s] people's brothers. They preach to\n[718.6s] people's mothers but they don't think\n[720.4s] that their mothers also need to be one\n[722.1s] true God believers. Amen. Barnabas knew\n[726.3s] that that is a work that must be done\n[728.7s] even to the relatives. And some of us\n[731.4s] think that this message is only meant\n[733.0s] for\n[735.8s] you. You don't even share that word. You\n[738.6s] give people papers but you don't\n[741.2s] remember your brothers. You give people\n[743.4s] documents and you think they your\n[745.1s] brothers will go to heaven and because\n[746.7s] you just love them because you given How\n[748.7s] many have ever thought\n[754.7s] that you don't think about\n[758.5s] them but listen who\n[761.9s] you I'm seeing another person called\n[765.1s] Jesus verse number 11. Are you seeing\n[767.9s] him Jesus called the name Jesus was a\n[771.2s] common\n[773.2s] name called the reason why Jesus again\n[778.3s] you know you can imagine living with\n[780.1s] Jesus in the\n[781.6s] house. Hallelujah.\n[784.7s] Yes. And Jesus is\n[787.6s] called justice who are the circumcision.\n[791.4s] These only are fellow workers who reign\n[793.8s] of God who did become comfort to me. So\n[799.2s] which people comforted Paul? These\n[801.5s] fellow workers they confronted Paul when\n[805.3s] Paul was in a problem. Please can we\n[807.2s] have such workers in this last days that\n[809.4s] we can be a comfort to one another. But\n[811.3s] if you have a problem you say I want to\n[813.8s] mention them. Belot Venus also brothers\n[818.9s] you have a sister also. So I will talk\n[821.7s] about that one next time. Nelson, James,\n[825.8s] those are the only brothers. You know\n[827.4s] when the Bible says those are the only\n[830.1s] what that means other brothers did not\n[832.9s] comfort. I don't want to go to that one.\n[835.4s] Verse number salute you do a father who\n[839.4s] is of you a servant of Christ always\n[841.5s] striving for you in what? Prayer. So\n[844.1s] there's a prayer band member here. I\n[845.5s] called you. What is a furnace doing?\n[849.4s] striving, praying on behalf of arms.\n[852.6s] Praise God. There were people during the\n[855.0s] time of Paul that were striving. You\n[856.9s] know the word striving, that means that\n[858.9s] person is a prayer warrior. I don't know\n[860.4s] if that is the name\n[872.0s] striving. Praise God.\n[878.0s] But there's a man the Bible mentions is\n[880.6s] striving for others. Praying on behalf\n[883.3s] of\n[884.0s] others striving for prayers in behalf of\n[886.9s] what others are you even you know I was\n[890.0s] looking at this box. This boxing nothing\n[893.4s] completely in this box. This is a prayer\n[895.2s] box. You mean prayer box? You cannot\n[898.0s] even struggle even make a prayer request\n[900.3s] for a brother that surely god I have a\n[903.0s] friend I want to write his name that\n[905.4s] even if he's not here God may use\n[908.3s] any to reach him look at the box people\n[911.9s] do not have prayers which prayers which\n[914.2s] prayers do we need to have we don't have\n[917.3s] look at this box even your mother if you\n[919.8s] don't have a friend does your mother\n[921.4s] love god but you have why don't you have\n[924.1s] tried alone since you love this\n[928.6s] others who like\n[931.2s] who like what say he can drive on behalf\n[936.3s] of you. Paul says there are others\n[940.2s] salute to you do epas who of you are\n[943.8s] servant or always driving for you in\n[946.9s] what in the\n[949.0s] prayers they are in this meeting and\n[952.0s] people\n[953.0s] refuse.\n[956.5s] Honorable\n[958.4s] brother relative even even a brother to\n[961.4s] your\n[962.8s] father so that may strive on\n[965.8s] their\n[967.9s] on if our relatives will get lost they\n[971.1s] will get off because you refuse that a\n[973.0s] parents cannot do what pray for you\n[975.8s] there were prayer warriors who are\n[977.9s] driving on behalf number\n[982.0s] one by the way Before I go to this, it\n[984.6s] says always striving for you in the\n[986.2s] prayers. That you may what? Stand\n[988.8s] perfect and made fully the will of what?\n[992.1s] God. There were people during the time\n[994.6s] of Paul that their work was to pray for\n[997.4s] God's people to stand\n[998.8s] what? In the will of who? God.\n[1002.0s] Hallelujah. Verse number 13. Are you\n[1004.8s] there with me? Say amen. For I do\n[1007.6s] testify to him that he has much zeal for\n[1011.3s] you and those\n[1013.8s] inia and those inolish. Meaning this\n[1017.5s] person had a zeal. The zeal he had for\n[1020.0s] the people of God. He was a zeal that he\n[1024.3s] want them to be saved. His desire was to\n[1027.1s] see. Do we have\n[1028.7s] mothers? I'm sorry that our mothers all\n[1031.2s] are outside. They are not here. who were\n[1033.8s] even praying for people that their work\n[1036.3s] is to see even young men even preachers\n[1039.8s] to be\n[1040.7s] saved confirms that I'm aware this\n[1044.4s] person prays hallelujah this person is\n[1048.1s] striving for us please let me ask\n[1051.6s] you what are you known for can people\n[1055.4s] say that surely we know so and so is\n[1058.3s] praying on my behalf are you aware if\n[1060.6s] you are going for miss there's a people\n[1063.0s] praying for me. I know they might not be\n[1065.8s] with me here but they are striving but\n[1068.0s] even if you have a prayer request you\n[1069.8s] can call please kindly kneel down and\n[1072.8s] pray on my behalf. Do you know why we\n[1075.7s] meet problems and we disturbed there are\n[1078.1s] people who have refused to pray for us\n[1080.1s] but can talk that\n[1082.4s] minister that\n[1087.6s] minister is that\n[1090.4s] prayers?\n[1092.6s] Hallelujah. This woman I don't know if\n[1095.4s] if it's a man or a woman. I don't\n[1098.4s] know. Is a what?\n[1102.3s] Three. What is he that people is that\n[1105.4s] what perfect? Is it to see a people\n[1109.6s] perfect church perfect ministers that\n[1113.0s] are not perfect? Paul says he testify\n[1117.0s] that he had much zeal in those prayers.\n[1119.7s] He prays for those in he prays for those\n[1123.5s] in. And then he finishes by saying\n[1126.6s] salute you Dr. Lucas. You know when he\n[1129.2s] say salute to you in it\n[1133.4s] says\n[1135.6s] medical. Hallelujah. In Paul's ministry\n[1139.7s] there were medical missionaries\n[1141.1s] physicians. Hallelujah. And the Bible\n[1143.4s] says that salute Lucas the beloved one.\n[1147.4s] Paul love Luke. Why Luke when his sick\n[1151.0s] was like Rolex walking with remedies.\n[1154.3s] Amen. That ministry was full. You know\n[1156.7s] today I've just seen a message that\n[1159.0s] there's a church\n[1167.7s] here. 57 members were brought\n[1179.1s] [Music]\n[1184.6s] district and do you know why Satan is\n[1187.3s] using such a\n[1189.4s] people they will say the churches are\n[1191.8s] like this the devil is so busy in fact\n[1193.4s] it's in the news I've placed it in the\n[1195.0s] group you can check it and see the\n[1197.1s] stories so dangerous\n[1200.5s] stories so people can\n[1206.8s] think but that is not that is how the\n[1209.0s] devil but devil will not make it Christ\n[1211.5s] has defeated the devil in heaven in the\n[1213.9s] cross in the garden of Eden Christ will\n[1217.6s] still lead praise God there was a\n[1220.0s] beloved physician this man is called who\n[1222.7s] I'm seeing here I'm seeing belat here\n[1225.4s] medical missionary in the room I'm\n[1226.9s] seeing you here I we are with in fact\n[1229.7s] Paul says we are with Lucas the beloved\n[1232.1s] Not. And then he says,\n[1234.5s] \"And and not.\" So when Paul is writing\n[1239.3s] the book of Colossians, he says,\n[1241.0s] \"They're with Lucas and they're with\n[1242.8s] who?\" They're with Demas. So how many\n[1245.9s] people were there when letter was\n[1248.2s] written? Two were next to what? Paul,\n[1252.0s] who who are they? Lucas and who? Demos.\n[1256.7s] Praise God. Lucas and who? Let me give\n[1260.7s] you some of the verses where the name of\n[1262.6s] Deas is mentioned. Uh, can I give you\n[1265.4s] those verses? Filimon 124. The Bible\n[1269.6s] reads,\n[1272.9s] \"Mus Lucas, my fellow workmen, are you\n[1277.1s] there in Philippians? Please check it.\n[1279.4s] Check it. My time is only 7 minutes and\n[1282.0s] I'm\n[1283.0s] praying.\" Philon 1 verse 24. The Bible\n[1286.6s] says, are you seeing it?\n[1292.3s] Musles. And who? Uh-huh. My fellow. So\n[1298.6s] Paul mentions his fellow what? Paul was\n[1302.6s] not working alone. Listen, in this work,\n[1305.0s] you must have fellow workers. I know\n[1308.6s] that there are times that the work was\n[1311.5s] too\n[1312.4s] tough. I told you the other time that\n[1315.0s] there's a time that John Mark had to\n[1317.4s] leave the work.\n[1318.7s] Hallelujah. Because the work was tough.\n[1322.0s] But Paul always had fellow workers. Even\n[1324.9s] at the time they were with Barnabas,\n[1326.6s] they had to\n[1327.8s] separate. They also met challenges the\n[1330.6s] way we do.\n[1333.0s] Hallelujah. Phil, not Philippians.\n[1335.9s] Please speak in a little tone.\n[1338.2s] Hallelujah.\n[1340.3s] Fleon 1 24 confirms not only in the book\n[1344.6s] of Colossians but says Marus and his\n[1349.3s] demas Lucas my fellow\n[1352.1s] what?\n[1353.7s] Work men. My fellow\n[1356.5s] what?\n[1358.7s] Workmen.\n[1360.6s] Workmen. I also\n[1362.9s] see I also see the\n[1366.0s] name of\n[1368.8s] uh this man written again in 2 Timothy\n[1373.4s] 4:10. For Demas had forsaken\n[1377.4s] me. Deas has done\n[1379.9s] what? Having loved the\n[1382.6s] present. In fact, there's a verse says\n[1385.4s] having loved the present age and is gone\n[1388.6s] to\n[1390.0s] Thessalonica to Galatia Titus to\n[1394.4s] Dalmatia. Praise\n[1396.4s] God. A fellow workman with Paul when\n[1400.9s] they were writing\n[1404.8s] letters preaching with\n[1407.3s] Paul and fellow Aman. Do you know the\n[1410.8s] book of Filimon is written to somebody\n[1413.8s] who\n[1414.7s] had you know who was\n[1417.6s] that? The book of filmon is written to a\n[1420.3s] man called who? Onesimus. And did you\n[1422.9s] see the name of\n[1424.0s] Onesimus? Onimus came back and joined\n[1427.0s] Paul. Paul made him a very you know what\n[1430.6s] did Onesimus do in the book of\n[1432.9s] filmon verse number one to three.\n[1436.8s] Let me say there\n[1441.4s] is the Bible says the Bible reads the\n[1444.2s] Bible reads Paul Paul a prisoner of\n[1447.2s] Jesus Christ and of Jesus Christ and\n[1449.6s] Timothy our brother Timothy our brother\n[1451.8s] and to Filon our dearly beloved and\n[1454.4s] fellow laborer and to our beloved Afiah\n[1458.2s] and Aibus our fellow soldier our fellow\n[1461.7s] soldier the church in thy house the\n[1463.4s] church in that so in the filimon's house\n[1465.4s] there was a what church. Uhhuh. Grace to\n[1468.5s] you. Grace to you and peace from God our\n[1471.0s] fatherh the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I\n[1474.0s] thank my God. I thank my God. Making\n[1475.9s] mention of thee always in my prayers.\n[1477.9s] Depends on you. Always in my word. Yes.\n[1481.8s] There was a church in the house for\n[1483.4s] those who think that they cannot leave\n[1484.9s] big churches. There was a church in the\n[1487.0s] house of filmon. Hallelujah. He always\n[1490.0s] and he tells I remember that church my\n[1492.2s] friend. Read very fast. It says, \"I\n[1495.4s] thank my God, making mention the always\n[1497.7s] in my prayers, hearing of my of thy love\n[1500.2s] and faith, yes, which thou has towards\n[1502.2s] the Lord Jesus, to all the saints, that\n[1505.0s] the communication of thy faith may\n[1506.6s] become effectual, and the knowledge of\n[1508.8s] every good thing which is in you in\n[1510.8s] Christ Jesus. For we have great joy and\n[1513.0s] consolation in thy love because the poed\n[1516.5s] by thee\n[1519.1s] brother might be much bold in Christ to\n[1521.5s] enjoy thee that which is convened\n[1523.3s] convenient yet for love's sake I rather\n[1526.6s] beseech thee being such an one as Paul\n[1529.4s] the aged and now also prisoner of Jesus\n[1532.0s] Christ I beseech thee for my son ones I\n[1535.4s] beseech you for my what my son ones my\n[1538.5s] son what ones the bible whom I be bonds.\n[1542.2s] Uh-huh. Which in time past, Uhhuh. was\n[1544.8s] to thee unprofitable. Or in the time\n[1547.9s] what? Pass. Was to thee what?\n[1550.9s] Unprofitable. Profitable. So that means\n[1553.8s] ones and lived with who? Filament. And\n[1557.4s] he said ones and profitable in the time\n[1562.4s] what?\n[1564.2s] Read the Bible. It says it says I\n[1568.2s] receive thee for my son. Yes. whom I beg\n[1571.4s] my bones which in time pass was to thee\n[1574.2s] unprofitable but now profitable to thee\n[1578.1s] and to me. Hallelujah. Never think only\n[1581.9s] that made profitable. Even so Paul made\n[1587.8s] Onesmas what profitable Onesimus was\n[1590.6s] chased by servant I will come back to\n[1593.7s] that sermon again I will come not now\n[1597.1s] imagine today I'm saying deas is when\n[1601.0s] letter is written 1 vers 24 he\n[1604.9s] sees being returned back to the work\n[1608.2s] having left hallelujah he was seeing\n[1612.1s] it he was\n[1615.1s] When Paul used to go and preach, he used\n[1617.5s] to be sent when people had convention\n[1620.2s] like this. He was a\n[1624.2s] speaking there were the let me go to\n[1626.6s] conflict and carry 349 paragraph 2 says\n[1630.5s] 349 conflict and carry says among\n[1633.4s] assistants at home were many of his\n[1635.7s] former companions and fellow workers.\n[1638.7s] Luke the physician was with him still.\n[1641.5s] Dus and Mark were also with him. So\n[1644.2s] which people were with him? Luke many\n[1647.0s] commissioners. Mark and with who?\n[1651.1s] See the early years of his profession of\n[1653.2s] men. Mark Christian experience had\n[1655.7s] deepened as he had studed more closely\n[1658.2s] the life of death and death of crimes.\n[1660.5s] He had obtained clear views of the\n[1662.2s] savior's mission. it toils and conflicts\n[1665.1s] reading in the scars scars and increase\n[1668.3s] hands and feet. The marks of Israelis\n[1670.7s] for humanity and the right in which\n[1675.5s] selfis had become willing to fight the\n[1678.3s] master in the back of what? Self\n[1681.9s] sacrifice. Self what? Sacrifice. Mark\n[1684.7s] came back and saw Mark coming\n[1688.9s] back. Das saw Mark leaving the work and\n[1692.6s] brought again to work again.\n[1697.4s] When somebody leaves the work, he has\n[1698.9s] never seen Jesus the way he should see\n[1700.6s] Jesus.\n[1702.8s] Hallelujah. When somebody leaves the\n[1704.9s] work, he has never seen the scars of\n[1706.5s] Jesus Christ who suffered for the world\n[1709.0s] humanity. Mark came back. We are told\n[1713.6s] now sharing the lot of Paul the\n[1717.2s] prisoner, he understood better than ever\n[1719.5s] before that it is infinite gain to win\n[1721.9s] Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. infinite\n[1725.2s] laws to win the world and lose the soul\n[1728.8s] from whose redemption the blood of\n[1731.7s] Christ was shed. In the face of severe\n[1735.3s] trial and adversity, Mark continued\n[1738.0s] steadfast and a wise and beloved helper\n[1740.7s] of the apostle. Why don't you say amen?\n[1742.8s] When Mark came back, he now understood\n[1745.7s] somebody can go home so that when he\n[1748.4s] comes back, he may be strong. All things\n[1751.1s] work together for what? for those who\n[1753.8s] love one and are called according to his\n[1757.5s] word. Praise God. When Mark came back,\n[1761.1s] he was stronger and he became an help of\n[1764.2s] Paul. Why don't you say amen?\n[1766.7s] But now was there\n[1769.2s] seeing the\n[1775.6s] condition\n[1778.1s] what ste for what afterward\n[1783.1s] forsook in referring to this Paul wrote\n[1787.1s] them as forsaken\n[1789.6s] having love this present 2 Timothy 4:10\n[1793.6s] for anyone\n[1795.4s] please I'm praying For what\n[1800.7s] every word\n[1804.4s] for them butter exchange those who do\n[1808.2s] not know the word butter it means\n[1810.9s] exchanging in traditional African\n[1813.3s] society. If you have a sheep, somebody\n[1816.2s] has got me you do what\n[1821.2s] he\n[1822.8s] noble. How many? How shortsighted be\n[1826.0s] exchange? power. Yes. Possessing only\n[1829.7s] one word.\n[1831.5s] Well, honor deas was a poor\n[1836.8s] ill might proudly call his home while\n[1841.8s] Mark choosing to suffer for Christ's\n[1843.8s] sake possess what being accounted in\n[1847.9s] heaven and what I joined her with his\n[1851.4s] words. Hallelujah. church them has left\n[1855.1s] because of Christ. They must left the\n[1858.3s] work having preached. Please do you know\n[1861.0s] the verse in verse 27 Paul says that I\n[1866.6s] bring my body under what subjection I\n[1870.3s] want this body to understand. I want to\n[1873.4s] control this body that having preached\n[1875.5s] to others I may not be what a time came\n[1879.6s] Dema said this gospel is very tough. You\n[1882.3s] know sometimes you may say you know I\n[1884.8s] can preach with the word but do you know\n[1886.6s] today young men you know Demas was a\n[1888.9s] young person and he went back to\n[1890.8s] Thessalonica. Do you know it is\n[1892.2s] Thessalonica whereby when Paul preaches\n[1895.1s] people are making noise. Do you know it\n[1897.6s] is Thessalonica whereby Paul says that\n[1900.6s] the people of B are not the people like\n[1902.6s] the people of why with them they they\n[1906.2s] wrote these things down and later on\n[1908.3s] they went to do what? This man goes to\n[1911.2s] Thessalonica where by the people were\n[1914.2s] not serious. Why? World\n[1918.5s] again. How poor was Deas milk accepted\n[1924.7s] to suffer for Christ sake. Imagine this\n[1928.1s] quotation says that Deas was poor\n[1932.3s] indeed. However much he might proudly\n[1934.3s] call his own. I have a cup. You know,\n[1937.4s] you cannot just walk for God barefooted.\n[1939.8s] Today I have a car. Do you have a\n[1941.4s] motorbike? You see, you you don't joke.\n[1943.9s] You know, walking for God. You see\n[1979.4s] Hallelujah. Don't look at me. This could\n[1981.9s] say\n[1986.2s] was pouring and however much he might\n[1989.0s] proudly call his words on that now\n[1992.6s] things don't we have today people who do\n[1995.8s] not people who do not understand the\n[1998.2s] sacrifice of Jesus and having preached\n[2001.0s] having suffered having walked in the\n[2003.6s] path humiliation they leave the gospel\n[2006.3s] work and join things so that they may\n[2008.6s] have things called the\n[2011.2s] word and they proudly walk say I cannot\n[2014.8s] walk in a way where I cannot get\n[2016.5s] anything I cannot suffer. Paul in\n[2020.5s] fact Mark choosing to suffer for Christ\n[2023.6s] sake possess it all being accounted in\n[2026.5s] heaven and of a joint hair with his son\n[2030.6s] if you permit our mind to dwell more\n[2032.6s] upon Christ and the heavenly world. We\n[2035.7s] should find a powerful stimulus and\n[2038.3s] support in fighting the battle of the\n[2040.3s] Lord. Why would you say amen? If we can\n[2043.4s] only be in Christ, we can be encouraged.\n[2047.2s] Even if we see the brethren we used to\n[2049.6s] have are now having good big houses,\n[2052.2s] good safets and you if you go to your\n[2054.7s] room you have nothing. You have old\n[2056.9s] mattress and people tell you because you\n[2058.8s] are walking walking walking for the go\n[2061.3s] walking walk walk walk walk walk walk\n[2061.8s] walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk\n[2061.8s] walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk\n[2061.8s] walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk\n[2061.8s] walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk\n[2061.8s] walk walking walk walk walk walk walk\n[2062.5s] walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk\n[2062.5s] walk walk walk walk walk walk walk\n[2070.5s] walk was poor indeed today those who are\n[2073.8s] poor indeed with big houses with big\n[2076.1s] vehicles poor indeed can love people\n[2078.8s] because they don't have anything\n[2081.7s] amen left the work to go and get worldly\n[2085.1s] riches hallelujah\n[2086.6s] Praise\n[2087.6s] God. It finishes by saying\n[2092.1s] pride and love of the world.\n[2097.3s] Why don't you say amen? Uhhuh. The\n[2099.7s] glorious\n[2101.4s] better so soon be our home. Beside\n[2104.1s] loveliness of Christ all attraction will\n[2106.7s] seem of little work. Hallelujah. I'd\n[2109.2s] rather have\n[2111.1s] Jesus 327 to say mommy to say mommy\n[2114.8s] please I'm encouraging my fellow young\n[2116.9s] men while is coming to this work I told\n[2119.9s] you about lot while is coming please I'd\n[2127.0s] rather 327\n[2129.9s] 327 please please\n[2132.9s] please Das was proud he had things he\n[2137.0s] was proud he had moved bag. He had a\n[2140.1s] vehicles. He had a big good house. He\n[2143.0s] had a suit. And he was telling Mark,\n[2145.7s] \"Who you wake up and a few clothes?\" Do\n[2148.5s] you know if you read the Bible, Paul\n[2150.1s] only had few clothes? Paul didn't have\n[2152.6s] enough Zeus. That is 2 Corinthians 11.\n[2155.1s] You will go and read at home.\n[2156.9s] Hallelujah. And he said, \"No, he cannot\n[2159.1s] make us.\" Number 3:27. Let's sing it.\n[2162.2s] This is Mark singing this song while\n[2164.5s] Demas is proud that he has things. The\n[2167.6s] way today people are proud, we are proud\n[2169.6s] of things we have and we can laugh\n[2171.5s] others and think that those people are\n[2173.8s] lost. They are not good gospel ministers\n[2176.4s] because they lack things that the world\n[2178.2s] have. Hallelujah. But how poor indeed\n[2182.3s] Mark was rich because he has chosen to\n[2185.1s] suffer for the sake of Christ.\n[2187.4s] Hallelujah.\n[2193.6s] 27\n[2196.0s] [Music]\n[2207.6s] Jesus\n[2210.1s] [Music]\n[2212.0s] is Jesus.\n[2218.7s] [Music]\n[2221.2s] by his heart to\n[2225.9s] be king of\n[2228.2s] our\n[2230.2s] [Music]\n[2232.4s] men in great\n[2244.9s] stus for\n[2247.1s] [Music]\n[2250.4s] I\n[2251.6s] rather Jesus\n[2256.1s] than I rather than the faithful\n[2261.0s] to\n[2262.8s] the\n[2274.4s] I mean\n[2277.0s] than to be the king of\n[2290.2s] our\n[2292.4s] [Music]\n[2300.8s] ra before you go to number three I\n[2303.4s] cannot pray ministers were in the gospel\n[2306.4s] field who are like Mark who sometimes\n[2310.1s] have drawn back and God has given you\n[2311.8s] opportunity ministers who are in the\n[2314.0s] field doing God's work but people tell\n[2316.2s] you my\n[2317.5s] brother please look at this\n[2321.0s] side until you forget suffering and even\n[2324.6s] people even tell you how you will suffer\n[2326.6s] when you follow that course that the\n[2328.2s] Lord has convicted you in his word that\n[2330.8s] it is the cause of Christ but people\n[2333.3s] tell you no no no you see you must have\n[2335.7s] this and when even look others how they\n[2337.4s] have become rich because they have\n[2339.5s] chosen that side you also say in your\n[2341.6s] heart surely I think that is the way but\n[2344.3s] you want to be steadfast in Christ and\n[2345.8s] you want Christ to help you please come\n[2347.4s] forward come forward we pray come\n[2349.4s] forward as we sing number three I want\n[2351.3s] to pray with those who want to be gospel\n[2353.8s] workers and the world promises you good\n[2355.8s] things but you want God to help you know\n[2358.2s] you may think Demas\n[2359.8s] was demas was also a minister like we\n[2362.7s] are but you have seen his name being\n[2364.7s] mentioned fellow servants but he left\n[2367.7s] and that must repeat itself now because\n[2370.8s] they were written for us. Number\n[2373.0s] three is fairer than leaves of red rest\n[2379.3s] blue is sweeter than honey from out\n[2387.8s] the angering spirit reach.\n[2392.8s] I rather ask Jesus and let him lead than\n[2399.1s] to be the king\n[2407.5s] over them.\n[2411.8s] I rather have Jesus\n[2417.0s] than this world.\n[2428.7s] Dear Lord in\n[2431.2s] heaven, I want to thank you so\n[2435.0s] much for allowing me present this\n[2437.9s] evening.\n[2440.6s] Thank you so much for the\n[2442.6s] message. Time is too short and soon and\n[2445.8s] very soon we will be going\n[2448.9s] home. We have seen Paul with his fellow\n[2453.8s] servants who were once\n[2456.1s] [Music]\n[2457.2s] faithful. We have seen Mark coming back\n[2459.7s] to the ministry and accepting Jesus\n[2461.9s] Christ as his personal savior. accepting\n[2465.0s] to\n[2465.9s] suffer, accepting to be poor in the\n[2468.8s] worldly goods which are being seen but\n[2471.8s] rich in heavenly goods which are not\n[2474.5s] seen. Dear Lord in heaven, Dembas chose\n[2478.1s] the\n[2478.9s] world. The spirit of prophecy has\n[2481.3s] confirmed he would have glorified\n[2483.7s] himself with the things he had but he\n[2485.7s] was poor\n[2486.9s] indeed. As we speak, the world is\n[2490.8s] presenting for us goods. a blouse of\n[2494.0s] men. Men are saying please don't waste\n[2496.9s] time in the gospel work. Paul was a\n[2499.0s] missionary just walking to and fro\n[2502.1s] having few\n[2503.8s] clothes didn't have enough things didn't\n[2506.9s] have peace and people are telling young\n[2509.6s] men don't walk like this\n[2512.4s] old you will have nothing to eat. The\n[2516.5s] same messages are being repeated to\n[2518.2s] minister today in the field and some are\n[2521.0s] choosing side. Some are busy in the\n[2523.1s] internet looking people for from abroad\n[2525.6s] to give them money so that they may have\n[2528.5s] good houses, good lands. They may have\n[2531.1s] the upper house of men, good suits. But\n[2534.4s] dear\n[2535.6s] Lord, some are even entering into the\n[2538.8s] worldly businesses which do not glorify\n[2541.9s] your name because they want to have\n[2545.8s] goods of this\n[2547.5s] world. How poor\n[2550.0s] indeed\n[2552.3s] was. But how was Mark?\n[2556.5s] These people are asking you to help them\n[2559.8s] together with myself. Help\n[2562.8s] us to be like\n[2565.9s] Mark found grace in your sight to come\n[2568.3s] back to your work. We pray in Jesus holy\n[2572.0s] name. God bless you."

So you are far advanced with the young evangelist and I'm learning so much here. So thank you. And thank you also for the privilege to share with you. We didn't expect to have that privilege. That's why we came with this casual appearance. So please forgive us about that. Um I want to start with a question. Um who of you wants to be a teacher? Can I have a show of hands? Is there somebody who wants to be a teacher here? Okay. You see I I want to be a teacher. So that counts as well. Can somebody read for for us Hebrews 5:12? painful, for when for the time he ought to be teachers, ye have been that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracle of God and have become such a sub need of milk and not of strong meat. Thank you. So let me ask you again. Who of you wants to be a teacher? Okay, we learn from this verse that Paul wants us to be teacher, right? That's the progression. We we come to learn of the Lord and the Lord gives us gifts and we we get trained and after a while we should be able to teach others to train others and that's how um the church of God multiplies because everybody becomes a teacher and teaches others. So I think that's the vision of Christ. I think that's also the vision of the young evangelists, right? You want to get trained to train others. Um that's the biblical principle. So basically the Bible wants us to be teachers and Paul even rebukes them because they weren't teachers at that time and they shouldn't. Right? So the condition of a teacher should be position that should be acquired by anybody who's part of the church of Christ according to Paul. After a while everybody should be a teacher. So let's read James 3 verse one 3:1 James 3:1 my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. Thank you. My German Bible translates be not many teachers. Be not many teachers. It says in my German Bible. So that's interesting, right? Because Paul says you should be teach us by now. James has a, you know, can you teach us at least according to my wife. So what's right now? Either we get rebuked by uh Paul or by James. No, that's that's not a contradiction right here. But there are two ways of being a teacher and these are inherently different to each other. two ways of being a teacher. Let me tell you which two ways exist there. So there is the way of being a teacher which is all about service. And there's the way of being a teacher which is all about status. There's the way of being a teacher which is all about responsibility. And there's the way of being a teacher which is all about personal gain. There's the way being a teacher which is all about having joy about bringing others to the position of authority and there's the way of being a teacher of having joy in being in a position of authority yourself and those are completely different types being a teacher and since I learned that the young evangelists they are all about training and we want to become teachers and teach others Let us now look at one person in the Bible who was a teacher. But unfortunately at that point of time he wasn't the second character. He was on status. He was all about having authority himself and not bringing others to that position. He was not about responsibility but more about personal gain. Um and we read of that person in J uh John Gospel of John chapter 3. John chapter 3 and please read verse one. Bible read verse one. There was man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus of the Jews. Yes. Thank you. So what what do we learn here about this man Nicodemus? He was a what? Pharisees. Thank you. And what else do we learn of him? He was a ruler of Jesus. Thank you. So he was a Pharisee. He was a learned man. Pharisees. Pharisees usually knew many large parts of the scriptures by heart. He was very knowledgeable. He was also one of the leaders of the Jews probably part of the St. Israel. That is what we also learned from Ellen White. So he was not only a teacher, he was up there up there in the society of the Jews. And what we what we learn also from from the writings of Ellen White is that he had pride about that. He loved being a teacher. He loved having this status of being a teacher. And so it it came to pass that he met Christ. But this meeting back then this meeting it didn't turn out the way it should. Let us look at the another person uh just John chapter 4 and please uh re read for us um verse 7 verse seven there come the woman who married to draw water Jesus said unto her give me to drink what's the name of that woman Samaritan woman yes we know where she comes from but we We all know her name here with Nikas. It was different. We know his name. He was up there. Everybody knew his name. This is just one woman coming to the well. It's not only it's not any woman. She's a Samaritan. She's not even a Jew. She's there. She's not a man. She's a woman. She's a Samaritan. And further we learn that she had many men. So where is she in society? Down there. Right. So Nicodemus is up here and she is down there. When when did Nicodemus approach Jesus? Right. We we looking from from John 3 verse 2, the first part of the verse. Can you read it to us please? Says the same came to Jesus by night. Yes, Nicodemus came by night and it is in the spirit of prophecy that we learn it was around midnight when it is darkest. You know there's much symbolism in that. Can can we read also John 13:E8 please? But in verse 8, Peter said unto him, \"Thou shalt never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered him, \"If I wish thee not, thou was not bad with me.\" Thank you, brother. Um um give me a second. That was the wrong verse. It's verse 30, right? Thank you, brother. It says he then having received the soul went immediately out and it was night. That was it. So this is about Judas and I find it interesting that John adds it was the night when Judas betrayed Jesus. So there's much symbolism in this. night is like there's no light and that was what the the the time when Nicodemus approached Jesus and the the interesting thing is in John 19 verse 39 maybe you can read it again for us brother 1939 the Bible reads and there came also Nicodemus which at the first came to Jesus by night and brought a mixture of Myra and others about 100 pound weight. So from this verse we learn that Nicodemus he changed. He changed and we praise God for that. But John adds here back then he came by night. Back then he was in darkness. So this is what he what what is the symbolism be behind Nicodemus approaching Jesus by night? Why did he come by night? Do you know? Do have you read in in the writings of Ellen White? Why did he come by night? It was his bride. He he didn't want to be seen with Jesus. So that's why he came to him by night. He didn't want to be associated with it was this pride of being a teacher and he didn't want to Yeah. He he had a wrong understanding of of his position as a teacher. Let's go back to the woman at the well. When when did she approach Jesus? John verse 4, I think. I don't know which verse it is, but let's just check it. It's verse six. Can you read it to us? Verse six. It reads, \"Now Jacob said was there. Jesus therefore being weary with his giant sapph.\" Do you know what time it is in our time? 6th hour. Midday. Thank you. And when the sun is at the highest point, that's the biggest light. So dear brethren, there's there's a lot to learn from this. And what what I want to take away from this and I I also I want to be a teacher. I want to be a good teacher. But let's not be a teacher like Nicol Demos was back then. Somebody who thinks of himself highly who who wants to be in a position of authority. You know, authority is nothing we should look look for because if anything, responsibility is a burden. And well, it is necessary that some men have responsibility. But the true followers of Christ, they know the burden that it brings with with itself and and they feel that responsibility. And we know this also from from Moses and many many men they knew that after a while when they were young they didn't know that Moses did not know that but after a while he understood oh authority that that is a heavy heavy burden and it's not something I should try to get it's not a position that is so nice for me so good in a way and if if you think that's a position you want think again. So because responsibility and and authority comes together and there's so much pain connected with this. We we see this especially with Jesus. So I I don't say that we should fear responsibility because if God gives us responsibility, we are ready for it. But we ourselves, we should always try to well to to not to think too highly of ourselves, right? So yeah, that's that's the thought I I wanted to to give you on on your way as as missionaries. Let's let's let's be humble. Let's stay humble. And if God may may raise us to a position of authority, it should be his will. But we from ourselves we we are it's good for us to just think of ourselves and just use that authority that we have right now and not look to to get too much of it. Yes. So um let us pray and of course it will kneel with me. Our dear father in heaven, your church needs responsible men and men who are able for the office of authority. And I pray that many men of this kind will arise from this group. So that's why I pray before anything else for the spirit of humility, for humbleness, for honesty. Dear father, please give this spirit to this precious group of young people and please lead them that there may be many men will arise that um many many teachers will come to the position of authority but by your will dear father not by one's own will that we pray in the precious name of Jesus. Amen.",

Is there somebody\n[37.8s] who wants to be a\n[39.3s] teacher\n[40.9s] here? Okay. You see I I want to be a\n[44.3s] teacher. So that counts as well.

So the condition of a teacher\n[142.2s] should be position that should be\n[145.0s] acquired by anybody who's part of the\n[148.1s] church of Christ according to Paul.\n[151.1s] After a while everybody should be a\n[153.3s] teacher.\n[155.8s] So let's read James 3 verse one\n[162.9s] 3:1 James\n[165.3s] 3:1 my brethren be not many masters\n[169.6s] knowing that we shall receive the\n[171.1s] greater condemnation.\n[173.3s] Thank you. My German Bible translates be\n[177.4s] not many\n[179.2s] teachers. Be not many teachers. It says\n[182.2s] in my German\n[183.5s] Bible. So that's interesting, right?\n[186.6s] Because Paul says you should be teach us\n[188.8s] by now. James has a, you know, can you\n[191.8s] teach us at least according to my\n[194.7s] wife. So what's right now? Either we get\n[198.1s] rebuked by uh Paul or by\n[201.6s] James. No, that's that's not a\n[203.9s] contradiction right here. But there are\n[205.8s] two ways of being a teacher and these\n[208.7s] are inherently different to each other.\n[211.4s] two ways of being a\n[213.3s] teacher. Let me tell you which two ways\n[217.0s] exist there. So there is the way of\n[221.1s] being a teacher which is all about\n[224.4s] service. And there's the way of being a\n[226.6s] teacher which is all about status.\n[230.1s] There's the way of being a teacher which\n[232.5s] is all about\n[235.1s] responsibility. And there's the way of\n[237.1s] being a teacher which is all about\n[239.0s] personal gain.\n[241.0s] There's the way being a teacher which is\n[244.2s] all about having joy about bringing\n[246.9s] others to the position of authority and\n[249.9s] there's the way of being a teacher of\n[252.2s] having joy in being in a position of\n[255.3s] authority\n[257.0s] yourself and those are completely\n[259.8s] different types being a teacher and\n[262.9s] since I learned that the young\n[265.2s] evangelists they are all about training\n[267.4s] and we want to become teachers and teach\n[269.6s] others\n[271.0s] Let us now look at one person in the\n[274.8s] Bible who was a teacher. But\n[277.3s] unfortunately at that point of time he\n[280.4s] wasn't the second\n[282.0s] character. He was on status.

He was\n[292.5s] not about responsibility but more about\n[295.2s] personal gain.\n[298.0s] Um and we read of that person in J uh\n[302.6s] John Gospel of John chapter 3.\n[309.6s] John chapter 3 and please read verse\n[312.6s] one. Bible read verse\n[314.8s] one. There was man of the Pharisees\n[317.9s] named\n[318.8s] Nicodemus of the Jews.\n[322.5s] Yes. Thank you.\n[325.4s] So what what do we learn here about this\n[328.4s] man\n[330.7s] Nicodemus? He was a what? Pharisees.\n[334.2s] Thank you. And what else do we learn of\n[336.4s] him? He was a ruler of Jesus. Thank you.\n[341.6s] So he was a Pharisee. He was a learned\n[343.8s] man. Pharisees. Pharisees usually knew\n[347.0s] many large parts of the scriptures by\n[349.7s] heart. He was very knowledgeable.\n[354.8s] He was also one of the leaders of the\n[357.9s] Jews probably part of the St.\n[360.9s] Israel. That is what we also learned\n[363.4s] from Ellen White. So he was not only a\n[367.1s] teacher, he was up\n[370.0s] there up there in the society of the\n[373.5s] Jews. And what we what we learn also\n[376.6s] from from the writings of Ellen White is\n[378.6s] that he had pride about that.\n[381.5s] He loved being a teacher. He loved\n[384.9s] having this status of being a teacher.\n[388.4s] And so it it came to pass that he met\n[391.9s] Christ. But this\n[393.9s] meeting back then this meeting it didn't\n[397.7s] turn out the way it should.\n[401.4s] Let us look at the another person uh\n[404.7s] just John chapter\n[407.2s] 4 and please uh re read for us um verse\n[412.6s] 7 verse seven there come the woman who\n[416.5s] married to draw water Jesus said unto\n[419.1s] her give me to drink\n[423.8s] what's the name of that woman\n[426.9s] Samaritan woman yes we know where she\n[429.4s] comes from but we We all know her name\n[432.1s] here with Nikas. It was different. We\n[435.4s] know his name. He was up there.\n[437.9s] Everybody knew his name. This is just\n[441.4s] one woman coming to the\n[444.6s] well. It's not only it's not any woman.\n[448.0s] She's a\n[449.1s] Samaritan. She's not even a Jew. She's\n[451.8s] there. She's not a man. She's a\n[454.7s] woman. She's a Samaritan.\n[457.6s] And further we learn that she had many\n[461.1s] men. So where is she in society? Down\n[464.7s] there. Right. So Nicodemus is up here\n[468.2s] and she is down\n[470.9s] there. When when did Nicodemus approach\n[475.0s] Jesus? Right. We we looking from from\n[478.4s] John 3 verse 2, the first part of the\n[481.7s] verse. Can you read it to us please?\n[483.2s] Says the same came to Jesus by night.\n[487.2s] Yes, Nicodemus came by night and it is\n[491.3s] in the spirit of prophecy that we learn\n[493.0s] it was around midnight when it is\n[499.2s] darkest. You know there's much symbolism\n[501.9s] in that. Can can we read also John 13:E8\n[506.0s] please?\n[507.8s] But in verse\n[511.7s] 8, Peter said unto him, \"Thou shalt\n[515.2s] never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered him,\n[518.2s] \"If I wish thee not, thou was not bad\n[521.1s] with\n[522.8s] me.\" Thank you, brother. Um\n[529.1s] um give me a second. That was the wrong\n[531.0s] verse.\n[533.6s] It's verse 30, right? Thank you,\n[536.5s] brother. It says he then having received\n[539.5s] the soul went immediately out and it was\n[542.6s] night.\n[544.2s] That was it. So this is about Judas and\n[548.5s] I find it\n[550.0s] interesting that John adds it was the\n[553.4s] night when Judas betrayed Jesus. So\n[556.6s] there's much symbolism in this. night is\n[559.7s] like there's no light and that was what\n[564.4s] the the the time when Nicodemus\n[568.0s] approached Jesus and the the interesting\n[571.8s] thing is in John 19 verse 39 maybe you\n[576.3s] can read it again for us brother\n[580.8s] 1939 the Bible reads and there came also\n[584.6s] Nicodemus which at the first came to\n[586.6s] Jesus by night and brought a mixture of\n[589.0s] Myra and others about 100 pound weight.\n[594.2s] So from this verse we learn that\n[596.7s] Nicodemus he changed. He changed and we\n[599.3s] praise God for that. But John adds here\n[603.6s] back then he came by\n[606.0s] night. Back then he was in darkness.\n[611.3s] So this is what he what what is the\n[615.0s] symbolism be behind Nicodemus\n[617.8s] approaching Jesus by night? Why did he\n[620.0s] come by night? Do you know?\n[625.1s] Do have you read in in the writings of\n[627.0s] Ellen White? Why did he come by\n[630.0s] night? It was his bride. He he didn't\n[633.4s] want to be seen with\n[635.4s] Jesus. So that's why he came to him by\n[639.2s] night. He didn't want to be associated\n[643.1s] with it was this pride of being a\n[645.8s] teacher and he didn't want to Yeah. He\n[649.1s] he had a wrong understanding of of his\n[651.2s] position as a\n[652.8s] teacher. Let's go back to the woman at\n[655.2s] the well. When when did she approach\n[657.5s] Jesus? John verse 4, I think. I don't\n[661.0s] know which verse it is, but let's just\n[663.6s] check it.\n[671.4s] It's verse six. Can you read it to us?\n[673.5s] Verse six. It reads, \"Now Jacob said was\n[677.1s] there. Jesus therefore being weary with\n[679.9s] his giant sapph.\"\n[684.2s] Do you know what time it is in our time?\n[686.3s] 6th hour. Midday. Thank you. And when\n[690.4s] the sun is at the highest\n[693.0s] point, that's the biggest light.\n[697.1s] So dear brethren, there's there's a lot\n[699.4s] to learn from this. And what what I want\n[701.7s] to take away from this and I I also I\n[705.4s] want to be a teacher. I want to be a\n[706.7s] good teacher. But let's not be a teacher\n[709.5s] like Nicol Demos was back then. Somebody\n[712.9s] who thinks of himself highly who who\n[716.3s] wants to be in a position of authority.\n[718.8s] You know, authority is nothing we should\n[721.6s] look look for because if anything,\n[725.7s] responsibility is a burden. And well, it\n[729.4s] is necessary that some men have\n[732.7s] responsibility. But the true followers\n[737.0s] of Christ, they know the burden that it\n[740.0s] brings with with itself and and they\n[743.1s] feel that responsibility. And we know\n[745.0s] this also from from Moses and many many\n[747.5s] men they knew that after a while when\n[751.8s] they were young they didn't know that\n[753.8s] Moses did not know that but after a\n[756.9s] while he understood oh authority that\n[759.7s] that is a heavy heavy burden and it's\n[763.1s] not something I should try to get it's\n[766.6s] not a position that is so nice for me so\n[769.6s] good in a way and if if you think that's\n[773.2s] a position you\n[775.1s] want think\n[776.9s] again. So because responsibility and and\n[782.4s] authority comes together and there's so\n[785.8s] much pain connected with this. We we see\n[789.0s] this especially with Jesus. So I I don't\n[792.4s] say that we should fear responsibility\n[794.6s] because if God gives us responsibility,\n[797.4s] we are ready for it. But we ourselves,\n[800.8s] we should always try\n[804.0s] to well to to not to think too highly of\n[807.9s] ourselves, right? So yeah, that's that's\n[811.7s] the thought I I wanted to to give you on\n[814.6s] on your way as as missionaries. Let's\n[817.8s] let's let's be humble. Let's stay\n[819.7s] humble. And if God may may raise us to a\n[823.1s] position of authority, it should be his\n[825.5s] will. But we from ourselves we we are\n[830.3s] it's good for us to just think of\n[833.8s] ourselves and just use that authority\n[837.0s] that we have right now and not look to\n[839.1s] to get too much of it. Yes. So um let us\n[845.4s] pray and of course it will kneel with\n[861.1s] me.\n[862.9s] Our dear father in\n[865.8s] heaven, your church needs responsible\n[869.1s] men and men who are able for the office\n[872.8s] of\n[873.8s] authority. And I pray that many men of\n[877.4s] this kind will arise from this\n[879.9s] group. So that's why I pray before\n[883.4s] anything else for the spirit of\n[886.9s] humility, for\n[888.8s] humbleness, for honesty. Dear father,\n[892.6s] please give this spirit to this precious\n[895.9s] group of young\n[897.4s] people and please lead them that there\n[901.0s] may be many men will arise that um many\n[906.4s] many teachers will\n[908.4s] come to the position of authority but by\n[911.8s] your will dear father not by one's own\n[914.6s] will that we pray in the precious name\n[917.1s] of Jesus. Amen."

And what do we know about Philadelphia? Philadelphia was the church where there was no rebuke and only praise. It I would say from all the seven churches was the best because even was really good had a small rebuke. Yeah. And then the laudisa it's embarrassing. We don't even want to talk about it. There's no praise at all and a lot of rebuke. So we we have to admit that we are part of these and it's not so nice. Uh and we see around the state of Christianity nowadays. It's not as we want it to be. Maybe in some place it's a little better. I'm sure here it's a little bit better. In our place it's medium. And in some places maybe really bad. So um what was taking place in the time of the early church? In the time of the early church with Ephesus. I um we have here some texts where it says for example and there was um Philillip and he had four daughters who prophesied. And then Paul was saying to the ladies, \"Hey ladies, please please please if if you prophesy please wear a head covering.\" So they were prophet prophesying all the time. So it was very common that there were prophecies that the Lord came over the men and women and gave prophecies. It was very common. So common that the Lord had to say please wear a head covering all all these prophecies. Please at least wear a head covering. So it was very common at that time. We I don't know anything about um prophets in the time between Ephesus and Philadelphia. probably there were here and there one but not much at least they're not very well known I I don't know any maybe you know some uh then we know um in the time of Philadelphia do you know a prophet who was living in the time Philadelphia as far as I know it was between 1798 and about 1900 maybe 1920 do you know any who was living at that time who was it okay yeah so we agree in that there at least one we know maybe there were more I don't know but at least one we know uh unfortunately she's not living anymore and uh as we found out uh in the church of Laisa there's not not so much there's no praise at all so um maybe that has something to do with that we don't have a prophet today or do you know a prophet amongst us is there a prophet here did did you know any somewhere could it could be could be There's somewhere a prophet. I I was thinking long. I didn't come up with one. Uh but maybe you have one here. Can I Does anybody know of a prophet nowadays? Yeah, there's one again. Yeah, false prophets were always around. Yeah, that that's that's that's um unfortunately the case, I'm sure. um for every for every true prophet, Satan will send five false prophets to uh make us um confused. That's unfortunately the case. So, but but um I mean here it's it's it's a nice group here of people who really want to go with the Lord, who really dedicate their lives for his service, who were who were really um devoted to the Lord. So that makes me very happy. And when we combine here uh the text that we're we're reading. So at uh Eli's time there was no prophet because uh the word of the lord was very rare because the leaders were really in a very bad um apostasy. In the times of Ephesus there were loads of prophets because the people were really faithful to to the teachings of Jesus. Then there was nothing. And then there was the church Philadelphia which had only praise. There was a very big prophet. And um then there was nothing anymore because we're now in Laosa. But we have also the promise from Acts two that in the end your sons and daughters will have dreams and your ancients and your old men and women will have visions. And even that's a quote from Joel chapter 2 where even he was prophesying in the end time at the very end we will have many um visions and dreams. So since I see now with a lot of joy in my heart that people are coming back to where they should be. We are coming back to the message that were was preached in the time of Philadelphia. I think we agree in this that all these things that we learn here about the father and the son and many other things about country living and health reform and and clothes reform and all these reforms that's that's just going back to the time of Philadelphia. So if we have really um groups here with uh lots of people who go back to the teachings that we know from Philadelphia from that time that were uh rediscovered at that time. I mean they were not new but at that time they were really keeping them. So we can expect that the Lord will be merciful to us again and he will send us also some visions and some prophe prophecies from some people and I wouldn't be surprised if one day like in a group like this somebody will come in in the morning and say oh brothers and sisters you know what this this night an angel came and you know what he said we should do this and this and he explained that Bible text and he was saying to me this and this yeah that was so unbelievable And uh don't don't laugh about him. Don't kick him out. I think that's that's what we can expect that will happen. And so don't be so um judgmental about these thing this person who might come. You can prove him. There are lots of proofs we have in the Bible. There will definitely come also some who will who will claim that. But there are wrong prophets. We have good Bible knowledge here in our group and many other groups nowadays. So you can prove. So what did he say? Uh ah okay. He met in he was in heaven. He met Abraham. Ah, forget it. Sit down. We don't want to hear you. He He is against the Bible. But Abraham is dead. So you we we can understand um if if everything that he says is in um conformity with the Bible that we know, I think very well now. um and his life is in in um accordance with the reforms and and he's a good Christian and unselfish and uh he's a loving person then and he's um yeah all these tests that we have then he's fulfilling them or or she it might be a she and it says the sons and daughters it will be also uh ladies elderly ladies and young ladies will have dreams and visions So this is what um I want to tell we what we can expect for the last days. We need special guidance. We have a lot of guidance here from uh Ellen White. But for the last days we might need some more that we can really be sure that there will I mean even she wrote that there will be still many things that we have to unlearn and learn and uh truth is progressive and we will learn more things. So there might be uh a ne necessity even especially in these last days when there are coming some problems that we don't really know how to react. I mean we had all the all these vaccines and there might come other problems uh in this world where we really not sure what what to do. Should we go this way or this way and then it might be very well um that God will give us special guidance. So this I wanted to encourage you to be aware of this and everybody leads a life that he might be the one or maybe even everyone uh can be enlightened directly by dreams and visions by the lord because uh it says here um in I think it was in first Corinthians strive to um have have visions and prophecies. It's it's it's something that we can desire. So that's what I wanted to say to you and I want to encourage you to continue on your road. I'm really happy to see all these faithful people. Uh go with the Lord and may you be blessed.",

We I don't know anything about um\n[111.4s] prophets in the time between Ephesus and\n[114.2s] Philadelphia. probably there were here\n[115.8s] and there one but not much at least\n[117.5s] they're not very well known I I don't\n[119.4s] know any maybe you know some uh then we\n[121.9s] know um in the time of Philadelphia do\n[125.4s] you know a prophet who was living in the\n[127.3s] time Philadelphia as far as I know it\n[129.3s] was between 1798 and about 1900 maybe\n[133.6s] 1920 do you know any who was living at\n[136.8s] that\n[138.6s] time who was it\n[143.5s] okay yeah so we agree in that there at\n[145.5s] least one we know maybe there were more\n[147.4s] I don't know but at least one we know uh\n[149.8s] unfortunately she's not living anymore\n[152.6s] and uh as we found out uh in the church\n[156.7s] of Laisa there's not not so much there's\n[160.2s] no praise at all so um maybe that has\n[163.4s] something to do with that we don't have\n[165.6s] a prophet today or do you know a prophet\n[167.4s] amongst us is there a prophet here did\n[170.6s] did you know any somewhere could it\n[173.2s] could be could be There's somewhere a\n[174.9s] prophet.

So since I see now\n[294.5s] with a lot of joy in my heart that\n[296.5s] people are coming back to where they\n[299.0s] should be. We are coming back to the\n[300.9s] message that were was preached in the\n[303.0s] time of Philadelphia. I think we agree\n[305.4s] in this that all these things that we\n[307.1s] learn here about the father and the son\n[309.3s] and many other things about country\n[311.6s] living and health reform and and clothes\n[314.0s] reform and all these reforms that's\n[316.1s] that's just going back to the time of\n[318.3s] Philadelphia.

I\n[332.2s] mean they were not new but at that time\n[333.8s] they were really keeping them. So we can\n[337.4s] expect that the Lord will be merciful to\n[339.8s] us again and he will send us also some\n[343.0s] visions and some prophe prophecies from\n[346.0s] some people and I wouldn't be surprised\n[349.0s] if one day like in a group like this\n[351.5s] somebody will come in in the morning and\n[353.2s] say oh brothers and sisters you know\n[355.3s] what this this night an angel came and\n[357.5s] you know what he said we should do this\n[359.0s] and this and he explained that Bible\n[361.3s] text and he was saying to me this and\n[363.3s] this yeah that was so unbelievable And\n[365.7s] uh don't don't laugh about him. Don't\n[367.6s] kick him out. I think that's that's what\n[369.9s] we can expect that will happen. And so\n[372.3s] don't be so um judgmental about these\n[375.5s] thing this person who might come. You\n[377.8s] can prove him. There are lots of proofs\n[379.7s] we have in the Bible. There will\n[381.3s] definitely come also some who will who\n[383.4s] will claim that. But there are wrong\n[385.0s] prophets. We have good Bible knowledge\n[387.3s] here in our group and many other groups\n[389.7s] nowadays. So you can prove. So what did\n[392.2s] he say? Uh ah okay. He met in he was in\n[395.2s] heaven. He met Abraham. Ah, forget it.\n[397.4s] Sit down. We don't want to hear you. He\n[399.5s] He is against the Bible. But Abraham is\n[401.9s] dead. So you we we can understand um if\n[405.2s] if everything that he says is in um\n[408.2s] conformity with the Bible that we know,\n[410.5s] I think very well now. um and his life\n[414.5s] is in in um accordance with the reforms\n[419.2s] and and he's a good Christian and\n[421.3s] unselfish and uh he's a loving person\n[425.0s] then and he's um yeah all these tests\n[429.3s] that we have then he's fulfilling them\n[431.5s] or or she it might be a she and it says\n[433.8s] the sons and daughters it will be also\n[436.5s] uh ladies elderly ladies and young\n[438.6s] ladies will have dreams and visions So\n[441.8s] this is what um I want to tell we what\n[445.1s] we can expect for the last days. We need\n[447.5s] special guidance. We have a lot of\n[449.5s] guidance here from uh Ellen White. But\n[452.6s] for the last days we might need some\n[454.6s] more that we can really be sure that\n[457.0s] there will I mean even she wrote that\n[458.9s] there will be still many things that we\n[460.5s] have to unlearn and learn and uh truth\n[463.2s] is progressive and we will learn more\n[465.1s] things. So there might be uh a ne\n[468.2s] necessity even especially in these last\n[470.6s] days when there are coming some problems\n[473.1s] that we don't really know how to react.\n[475.3s] I mean we had all the all these vaccines\n[477.3s] and there might come other problems uh\n[480.0s] in this world where we really not sure\n[482.2s] what what to do. Should we go this way\n[484.4s] or this way and then it might be very\n[487.0s] well um that God will give us special\n[490.3s] guidance. So this I wanted to encourage\n[492.6s] you to be aware of this and everybody\n[495.3s] leads a life that he might be the one or\n[498.4s] maybe even everyone uh can be\n[500.5s] enlightened directly by dreams and\n[502.4s] visions by the lord because uh it says\n[505.7s] here um in I think it was in first\n[509.2s] Corinthians strive to um have have\n[512.5s] visions and prophecies. It's it's it's\n[514.6s] something that we can desire. So that's\n[517.2s] what I wanted to say to you and I want\n[518.9s] to encourage you to continue on your\n[520.6s] road. I'm really happy to see all these\n[523.0s] faithful people. Uh go with the Lord and\n[526.9s] may you be blessed."

        "full_transcript": "According to the book of 1 Corinthians, he is telling us that no man can lay no other foundation than that which was laid by Christ. And when Christ was calling the Millerite movement that the birth of the Remnant church must be established, he he tried step by step for the advancement of this truth. And when the church apostiated and we separated ourself that we may come and establish this church, when you have come and establish this church, it means that we are not establishing another foundation. But we are uh we want to build the foundation that were laid by Christ, that were laid by the prophets and that were laid by the pioneers of the church. Praise God. Are you getting me up to that point? So we want to discuss a topic called ordination and credential. And before I do anything I want to can you write ordination. What is the meaning of ordination? Go with me in Noah dictionary ordination. Can you first come you tell me I read on my own ordination. You write the meaning of ordination. ministers, elders and judge members. I want you to be keen and I don't want to see any elder not writing. Kindly, you may forgive me on that, but kindly write. Kindly, please write ordination. You write give me the meaning of ordination. I want you to read with me. The state of being ordained or appointed establish order or tendency consequent of an decree. Number two, virtue always vice have natural relation to the happiness and mystery of life representative. Let me just proceed. Let me run with you in number three. in the priest priestbyarian and congregational church. The act of settling or establishing a license clergy man over a church and congregational with pastoral charge and authority. Also the act of conferring on a clergy the powers of a minister of the gospel without the charge or oversight of a particular church. or a particular church but with general powers of an evangelist who is authorized to form churches and administer the sacramental of baptism and the Lord's supper where he may be called to officiate I want you to mark the last words the first statement is saying that the state of being ordained or appointed it means that ordination for you to be ordained First you must be appointed. That is number one. The second one when you are ordained an evangelist or an elder first you have to consider that what is your biggest work to do sacramentals to do baptism and to do the Lord's supper. Praise God. It means that we have to be ordained ordination must be in the church of God. Number two, give me credential. Credential. Then I try to tell you one thing. [Music] Credential. Credential. Yes. Credential. Because the reason why we try to investigate this thing because when we are looking for the advent movement, we look for the year 1861 when this church was being established when uh because in 1860 as we know the seventh the saparian adventist was given the name 7th day adventist and as we proceed in the year 1861 the first conference which was organized was the mystigan conference and when mystigan conference was organiz organized. First they try to elect the chairman and they try to elect CL cla and after that there is first step of organization when you want to flee to the gospel order first we have to come to the organization but there's first step when we want to say that this body has been organized this first step that we got to follow can we read credential you have been told that that which give credit. Write that. That which gives credit, that which give a title or a claim to confidence, the warrant on which belief, credit or authorities claimed among strangers as the letters of commendation and power given by a government or ambassador or envoy which give him credit at a foreign court. So the powers of working miracles given to apostles may be considered as their credentials. authority to them to propagate the gospel and entitling them to credit. First word credential is that which give a credit. It means that when I have my credential, it means that I have been given a credit by this organization to go and propagate this thing. Are we okay? When I am in uncertain circle, I can been given a credit. I can been given a pro a water credential. Then when I go to another company which we are working with but not here in Kenya maybe in America I can show my credential they say ah you are our own we are in one organization we are in one circle to do this work. Are we okay? So why credential? Because there's something that tendency that has come to this church that was in seventh adventist church that when the church when we want to put this church in order in every way people there has been two what two mind that when we organize our church will come Babylon do people have those minds that when I organize I will lose my son give me the value when we organize that many people fear that when I organize I'm going to lose my influence. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. But before we organize, we must know that the first step of organization is ordination and credential. Ordination and credential. Go with me in the book of one bio. The book of one bio. The book of one by page 455. 455 paragraph number three. You hear first when the Mexican conference was organized because we have to know that 7th adventure general was organized in the year 1863 but Michigan conference was organized in the year 1861. So when the Mexican conference was organized what was the first step which was being taken? Read with me. It reads, it reads, \"Resolved that our minister papers consist of a certificate of orination.\" That it was resolved. Our minister's papers consist of certificate of ordination. First, the papers of ministers must consist of one, the certificate of coordination. Coordination. Let me ask you, can I have a certificate of coordination before reaching that coordination? for certificate. It means that someone being he must be scrutinized. His ways must be first investigated before being ordained. So fast they told that it was in that it was in par that that our minister's papers consist of certain valition also credentials to be signed by chairman and of the conference. So right the first step of coronation before writing that can you read a 18 a 18 uh act of apostle 18 act of apostle page 18 it reads it reads it was at the ordination of the 12 it was at the ordination of the 12 that the pastor step was taken in the organization of the church that the first step was taken in the ordination of the of the church. So when we want to call ourselves that we have organized into one body, what should we do? Ordination. Ordination. Praise God. Amen. That a church be without ordination without redemption. It is not organized. It is going to be praise God. [Music] Because the Christ has given was that go and bring the gospel baptizing them in the name of the father the son and the of the holy spirit in you. So it means that you cannot preach and bring people to church without baptizing them and without being bapt without baptizing someone it means that you must be ordained. So the first step of organizing church is doing what is called ordination. Are we clear at that point? So when we are in ordination is being given a credit to offer sacmental services the Lord that is number one mark that so let us go one by so when I I am being given credentials what should be done first a credential is being given to ministers there are credential can be given to ministers who are being ordained there are also Credential that can be given ministers to do to preach the gospel. Preach the gospel. Credential is what is called lense. Because we know the other day that in the year 1833 Miller was given license. But when did Miller started preaching? Yes. 1831. And he was licensed in which year? It means that I cannot just enter the gospel today and I am being given the credential today. Are we sure at that point I cannot enter the ministry to do the gospel work today and in this day or in this year being given a credential it cannot work. It is confusion and below that a credential should be signed by the chairman and the cler of the conference. That is number one. Number two that which credential shall be renewed annually? This credential shall be renewed annually. annually. Praise God. So it means that when I been given a credential in the next year this credential should be renewed that is they shall be renewed annually. So the question it means that if given a credential has been he has not been faithful in this work in the next year can he but let me ask you if I have been in this church and in the next church or in the next should I be ordained again should be ordained And then no. C O D 173. C O D 173. C O D 173. 171 not 1731 paragraph is paragraph number seven. Verse 21 paragraph 7. It reads paragraph 7. Paragraph 7 reads. If a person who has been ordained to the ministry, if a person who had been to the ministry on account of ma fails to have his credential renewed by the conference who fails to have it credential renewed to the conference is he in that condition authorized to baptize? Is he in that condition authorized to baptize to officiate at communion to officiate at communion and perform the marriage ceremony? to the point of according to the question number one he has to he can baptize he can baptize it mean that someone who is not being ordained cannot baptize that is number one the holy communion and communion can women be ordained it means that they can officiate holy communion thank you Number three, they cannot perform a marriage ceremony. Number three, they cannot perform marriage means an elder who not can perform a marriage ceremony. Go with me in 173. It is 173 paragraph number four. It reads, it reads, \"Would it be proper for one who has been ordained as an elder of a local church 173. Yes. Read now. Would it be proper for one who has been ordained Will it be proper for one who has been ordained as an elder of a local church of an elder of a local church but has not been reelected but has not been reelected in that church to take the lead in the breaking of bread? Can he lead in the breaking of the bread on baptism? That is a question. What is the answer? If he has been ordained as an elder church, if an elder has been ordained as an elder of this church and has been faithful in church duties, if that has been church duty although we moved to another church again, it might be for him to officiate request by the church. Amen. Can you again? It means that he has to lose his credential and before he can read again he must be scrutinized again that anger canain also ministers can be okay to be what should be P A P A N The time is there for you. Prepare your questions. I'm almost ending. PM PM from a trip I'm sure before ordination I'm not going to start topic min ordination paragraph paragraph number one ordination in the is the church's public recognition of divine Because this by the laying on of hands the church authorizes minister to teach the church authorize the church the church authorizes ministers to teach that is number one baptize to baptize and organize churches and organize churches. So who has been given to organize churches? The ministries. Who? The ministries. Ministers. And if a minister has been ored, how many works can you do? Then he can teach. Number two, baptized. Number three. Praise God. Amen. So after that acts 13:1 before being sent forth it says before being sent forth as missionary to the heist ministers it say but before being sent forth as missionary these apostles were solely dedicated to God these apostles were solely dedicated to God by fasting by prayer and by two prayer and the laying on of hands and number three by coordination. has been authorized by the church. They must be authorized by the church. Not only to teach the not only if you are not only to teach the truth but to perform the rights of baptism but to perform the rights of baptism and to organize churches number two to organize churches being invested fullical authority to teach the truth to baptize and organize churches. So before baptize you must be that your ordination must be authorized by the church. I can hear. Thank you. Number two reads before the nation and ministers write this that beforeation miners should give evidence that they have dedicated themselves the work should give their obligation that they dedicated their works to themselves the work. So if that minister is lagging here to here to here and dedicate yourself to God can dedicated his word to God but to God. There must be evidence on the part of those who take the song position of the shepherds that they have without reservation to be given themselves to the word. You must dedicate yourself first to the work of God. They must take Christ as their personal savior. They must take Christ as their personal savior. Hands laid upon men to ordain them for the ministry before they are thoroughly examined. Hands are laid upon them to the ministry before they are thoroughly examined as to their qualification for the sacred. But how much better would it be to make work before accepting them as ministers? But how much better would it be to make thorough work before accepting them as ministers than to have to go through this rigid examination? That to have to go through this rig examination become established in their position. Yes. And I'm not it must be scrutinized. Number one. Second item. There are two things in the ministry of God and the work of God. They are only licensed ministers and they are also ordained minister. I can be licensed as minister or I can be given a credential as a minister but I cannot baptist. I wish I get at that point. I can be licensed and I will bring the truth but I cannot do what you baptist. I cannot be baptized. Can you do one bio page 2 bio 173 biome 173 173 The paragraph is paragraph number one. Can you hear me? In the year 1867, what has happened? And I give you the age of baptism that has been in the 173 number one. The statistical report of the conference session list 28 today ministers say the statistical report of the conference session. This is the statistical report on the conference side in the year 1867 listed 28 ordained ministers. How many ordained ministers? 28 ordained ministers. 10 licensed minister. 10 licensed ministers. 4320. Praise God. Amen. It means that I can be I can be lined. It means that not every ministers can do can do baptism can do lot marriage also also marriage praise God ministers let any minister define just baptizing and holding or if you are not being also in this work you will lose your predation and your ordination. So the church must ple into gospel order that these doors that the devils let in should be closed. So let me give some of the examples of the ericated miners. You write the year it was in the year 1854. You write ADVP page 14 ADVP Adventist Bion and Pictures Page 14.2 age because some may say that what age they receive one of this example two number two it says it says John not became a Sabbathke keeping Adventist he became a Sabbathke keeping Adventist through the labor of John Neon Andrews of John Neon Andrews began preaching immediately and was obeyed in 1854 began preaching immediately. He became a he says he became preaching. He began preaching immediately. He began preaching immediately. I was obeying in the year 1854. Can you he was in which year? 1854. 1854. At which year? Go to the last words. It says when he was only 22 years old. Can you stud it say was the first man to receive was the first man to receive and who was later to be known as the seventh day child this when he was only 22 years only 22 years old it means that a minister of 22 years old andained if he has been faithful in his work praise God amen when he was 32 years You can read with me page 98.5 page 98 number 598 number five 989 John Lboro Mhm. Huh? Page 98. 98. Yes. Number five. Two by page 98. The paragraph is paragraph number five. It reads 98 paragraph 5. Yes. Go and James. Can you if you can stress where Smith was 32 years? Uh how it says says the motion carried Smith was 32 years of age. Smith was 32 years of age. I have just the day before been ordained to the ministry. The ministry at which 32 years old are clear at that point the young can be ordained the alo can be done what can be ordained. So it means that we want to make a point of guidance we have given authority to that day. The reason I have shown you brother John was because the although this church in the year 1854 has not had a strong organization but they had strong leadership. No one could be recklessly allowed to or baptize before. So it means that when you guys are being ordained is considered. Can you read this book 360? You can write on choosing leadership or coordination with six. 360 it reads it says continu has done not bear the balance he had he has had to bear in keeping things together let's work with him and sustain him yes brother MG Kellogg has done what he could brother MG Kellogg has done what he could he has an excellent spirit and he has an excellent spirit no No one has the word of tot. in spirit. No one has a word to find with him to find with him. If it means that church members have been calling and I ask you is there anyone with international then someone can I have a then he is being found disgra it says he is conscious he is cautious very timid and selfish and selfish consensious consensious and devoted to the world and devoted to the world but become not be discouraged if the labor he puts forth will not see result in immediate good. Great. He was ordained at the camp meeting. He was ordained at the meeting and this will be a courage and strength to him. And this will be a courage and strength to him. His wife is a thoroughly converted woman. Unite before his wife must be what? Thorally converted. A thoroughly converted woman. Woman. Praise God. that is is not converted. He's not even as Adventist. Can I because my wife is unconverted? She has upon accountance expression of contentment and peace to the immediate surrounding. It means that also my wife must be considered if he's really is she really converted? Is she really converted? Going to the next one. Next paragraph. TD O in the blue estate. TD in the blue state to give you time that you may add or you may ask your questions. TD the doctrine of Christ. So 2 to8 one says 2 to8. Can I give another migraine? [Music] It says it says the officers of the church recognize the New Testament. The church recognizing the New Testament are bishops are bishops or elders or elders and deacons. Bishops, elder and deacons. Because as stated in Philippians 1 verse number one go to the next one says the terms bishop the terms bishop and elder an elder defining office of the church defining the bishop's church are used synonymously so an elder also can be called bishop you write Titus 1 vers 5 to 7 go to the next one according to the record found in the new testament according to the reports found in the new testament the elders were appointed by the apostles The elders were appointed by the apostles or some are designated by them. Some are designated by them. Is to designate an elder. Apostles apostle. An elder canate an elder. But the apostle is a vist. The office of the [Music] is going to the next one. The seven men who were in charge of the daily administration. Number five. Five. Yes. The qualification of a bishop and elder. Theification of addition and put in the following scriptures. And put forth in the following scriptures. 1 Timothy 3 1-7 1 Timothy 3 1-7 Titus 1:5-9 to 9. We are on the Sabbath. Vision number eight. Number eight. Number eight. Yes. The end of the church at Jerusalem. The sed Jerusalem. Sat with the apostle in the past council. Sat with the apostle in the past council. And the decision made then was sent out in the joint name of the apostles and elders. Go to the next one. [Music] Save the inspire apostle. saying the inspired lay hands suddenly on a onlay hand upon a certain man in in some of our churches in some of our churches in this seventh adventist church organizing and ordaining elders has been premature the organizing and has been really premature rule has been disregarded rule has been disregarded consequently stable has been brought upon the church there will not be so great haste in electing leaders. There are so leaders as to ordain men who are in no way fitted for the respons but they are really unfitted with the work of we should have noticed but God has us to follow the order of men who need to be converted men who need to be converted elevated and noble and noble refined refined before they can serve the cause of God in any capacity to be converted. If I was having on some 12 years with this church, but has been I have not been really converted. I should the church will not take time to read them. Let gather both good and bad. It takes time for to be developed. There must be time to learn what men really are. The next one, the family of the one suggested for office should be considered. The family of all shall be considered family. The family shall be considered. Are they in subjection? Are they in subsp are his children? The children are not converted. when it is the right of this church because they are qualified. It means that when you hear this that when my child is going to the institution the man is going to revote the the parents are going to receive the mark of the why because he's the head of the church also when an elder has been put at the head of the church and his child is going to the institution it means that the early church is going to receive the mark of beast Thank you my brother. It means that should not even be connected with the institution of the beast. Are you judgment? If your effort is on the other side, you walk to the on the other side and you also can you ask an elder of the church it means that he belongs to that city. If it's not a church member, can it be can we take elders from church to be an of this church? Can it be possible? It means that you can take an effort on that is not a church member. It means that the reason of me should be renewed to that again. He can be ordained. But if not, you cannot be without it. Will they do to the father's influence? To the father's influence. So it means that my child has not honored me in my house. If he has not tacked it not tacked wisdom or power of holiness at home in the managing his house it is safe to conclude that the same defect will be carried to the church. It is said that the same defect will be carried to the into the church. That's fine. These churches are our churches are good. Our churches are blind. Why? I can say church is blind because the church is not because of the church of blindness. Even the church will be blind. We not going to receive eternity. with the blind child. It says if he has not tal power goodness at home in managing his own family it is safe to conclude that the same defects will be carried into the church and the same unsanctified management will be seen there. It will be far better to criticize the man. It will be far better to criticize the man before he is put into office. You must be criticized before being put into an office. After what? But then after better to pray and cancel before the taking decisive step. To pray and cancel before taking into that office than to labor to correct the consequence of a wrong move. [Music] 2 31 316 316 I want to give you time 316. The paragraph is paragraph number one. It says it says sister as your husband might be some might be of some use in the church. Kindly save [Music] me. Okay. Okay. And you kind of your hand kindly. Should I call you by name? Sister S. Your husband might be of some use in the church. Indeed. Your husband is converted. When your husband start to pres your husband has strength and he has strength. Sister S. Sister, your husband might be of some use in the church. Of some use to the church. If your influence or what it ought to be, if your influence is what it should ought to to be. But influence your influence is by now. It cannot be of use to the church. But example and influence example and influence disqualifies him to exert a sanctifying influence in the church. Disqualify him. again. No. No. Says it says home influence more than more than counteract his effort for good. More than counteract for good. You are holy and qualified to be the wife of an elder to be a wife of elder of the child. Your husband is disqualified and is disqualified to be an elder. You are really disqualified, unquestim It says your husband has a work to do to set his heart and house in order to set his house and heart in order. When he is converted that will be converted then he can strengthen his brother then he can come and strengthen the church. So just stay away. We need not your help before being converted. But after conversion come and we we need your influence but before we need you. Praise God. Are we clear? So how many of you have been baptized by elders? Means that I am an elder before I cannot baptize. So a question I was going to give you. You read with me 1. 1 48 1 It says matters for conference consideration says that is paragraph five. The paragraph is paragraph number five. The ministry this conference session said Paul you can tap your name. Thank you for that. Now it says the minister of this conference session we want to establish this church in the exist. Is that your will? It is also my will. If it is our will then let us agree to what our pioneers agreed read. It reads, it reads the minutes of this conference session, the many minutes of this conference session support some interesting items of business interesting items for business. Mhm. From Wisconsin. Yes. Calling for the opinion of the conference. How shall we treat divorced marriages? There has been this chart. This chart has a lot of problem. Are we okay? This church really has a lot of problem. The question is number one, how shall we treat divorce? What divorce marriages? Number two, shall preachers from other denominations embracing the message preach and baptized among us on the strength of their former relation standing as ministers? It says it says shall preachers from other denomination shall preachers from other denominations embracing the message embracing the message preach and baptize among us if I am from another denomination but I am embracing this message shall I preach and baptize preach and baptize preach and baptize in the strength of their form ordination and standing and missing standing as ministers. Let me say that brother organization another denomination but he was can I preach again? That is a question I don't want you to answer. The third question it says it says shall young preachers shall young preachers before being ordained before being be allowed to baptize be allowed to baptize shall and young preachers before being shall me allow baptizaptions after satisfying themselves the full intent of the first Christian yes and asserting that that that who is involved Yes. Was accepting into judge membership those couples. Yes. Comprising of individuals who have been divorced resolved that the matter of divorce marriage be referred to the conference committee. I'm going to discuss the matter of divorce marriages. But divorce marriage in a church. It should be referred to the conference committee. It says true. It should be referred to the conference committee. Not any minister elder found in the church following the wizard let him be referred to what the government committee was that solution number two solve number two what was the question that ministers other denominations go to the question number two question number two this ministers evangelist shall preachers from other denominations shall preachers from other denominations preaching the message the message this message of one true God preach and baptize among us should preach and baptize among us on the strength of theiration on the strength of theordination understanding as ministers should we come and stand that I am a minister of this because I believe this truth this is all that ministers of other denominations some of present truth Please should give proofs of being called to preach the message. They should first give proof of being called to what? To preach the message. Yes. And be ordained among us. Then they should first give truth for years. Number two, they must be doing what again?

The godhead. Praise God. I don't know that because it say number one is the the godhead the father the father the son the son see the holy spirit is the holy spirit I don't want to are they different shall they be allowed to baptize among us shall elders who have not been ordained allowed to baptize among I don't want to read that. Number three. Question number three. Number three. Yes. It reads, \"Shall young preachers shall young preachers for being ordained before young preachers being ordained be allowed be allowed to baptize resolved. It was resolved that no person omega that no person young or old an evangelist young or an old elder should administer ordinances before being obeyed should not administer ordinances ordinances baptism and lots it means an elder who has not been ordained should not be allowed to baptize Yes. Praise God. It means that if you are baptized by what baptized by an elder who has not been obeyed, you have to be rebaptized again. If you baptized by an elder who has not believed in, you have to be baptized. And I know you know what the message means. You read me SP1.5 as you prepare your question. SPN reads it reads I saw the nominal chart page two SPM 3.8.8 It says it. So those who have been drawing the churches just read says it say I saw those who have been baptized as the churches. I saw that those who have been baptized as going into the churches have to be baptized again as the faith. They have to be baptized again into the door or they go missing. Those who have not been baptized since 1844. Those who have not been baptized since 1844. You have to be before Jesus come. You have to be baptized before Jesus comes. This church will not progress. The reason why our publishing house is not working. Ministers are converted. Elders are unconverted. The church members you are not able to pro. Why? Because you are not being baptized. You have been baptized by someone who does not allow the message. If I could have time, we could read over and after I know you know what the third angel's message is. After the third angel's message, you have to be rebaptized again. After learning the Sabbath message, you have to be rebaptized again. Let me conclude at that point. Can you read? Then I saw those who stand making up the bridge and standing in the former sees 184 written the commandments and so follow the yes as the first day instead of the seven. Yes. See the light shown out of the Muslim. Yes. Given up the institutions of the pop. Are you understanding? [Music] It reads, can you kindly understand this kindly?

You will leave the institution of the word for the pop and are keeping God's Sabbath would have to go down into the water. You have to go down into the waters and be baptized in the faith of the sanctuary and be baptized in the faith of the sanctuary and keep the commandment of God and the faith of Jesus. Praise God. Amen. If you are baptized and you have gone back to the institution of the beast, Babylonian institutions, you have to be rebaptized again. How many have gone to the institution of the beast after being baptized? How many have been baptized by the elders in the institutions of the beast? You have to go down into the water again. But you cannot go down to the you will not have any progress. there will be no progress in you. I don't know how to explain but too many years this person. Praise God. Any question? That's not a comment. Yeah.",
        "timestamped_transcript": "[0.0s] According to the book of 1 Corinthians,\n[1.8s] he is telling us that no man can lay no\n[4.2s] other foundation than that which was\n[6.7s] laid by Christ. And when Christ was\n[9.7s] calling the Millerite movement that the\n[12.8s] birth of the Remnant church must be\n[14.6s] established, he he tried step by step\n[18.3s] for the advancement of this truth. And\n[21.4s] when the church apostiated and we\n[24.2s] separated ourself that we may come and\n[27.1s] establish this church, when you have\n[29.1s] come and establish this church, it means\n[30.9s] that we are not establishing another\n[32.9s] foundation. But we are uh we want to\n[35.6s] build the foundation that were laid by\n[38.5s] Christ, that were laid by the prophets\n[41.4s] and that were laid by the pioneers of\n[43.7s] the church. Praise God. Are you getting\n[46.0s] me up to that point? So we want to\n[48.2s] discuss a topic called ordination and\n[50.1s] credential. And before I do anything I\n[53.6s] want to can you write ordination. What\n[55.5s] is the meaning of ordination? Go with me\n[57.7s] in Noah dictionary\n[62.4s] ordination.

Number two,\n[100.4s] virtue always vice have natural relation\n[103.1s] to the happiness and mystery of life\n[106.3s] representative. Let me just proceed. Let\n[109.0s] me run with you in number three. in the\n[113.0s] priest priestbyarian and congregational\n[115.9s] church. The act of settling or\n[119.4s] establishing a license clergy man over a\n[123.2s] church and congregational with pastoral\n[126.4s] charge and authority.

Then I try to tell you one\n[204.9s] thing.\n[205.7s] [Music]\n[209.6s] Credential.\n[211.9s] Credential.\n[216.4s] Yes. Credential. Because the reason why\n[219.5s] we try to investigate this thing because\n[222.1s] when we are looking for the advent\n[223.9s] movement, we look for the year 1861 when\n[227.4s] this church was being established when\n[230.0s] uh because in 1860 as we know the\n[232.7s] seventh the saparian adventist was given\n[236.0s] the name 7th day adventist and as we\n[239.4s] proceed in the year 1861 the first\n[242.2s] conference which was organized was the\n[244.1s] mystigan conference and when mystigan\n[247.0s] conference was organiz organized. First\n[249.0s] they try to elect the chairman and they\n[252.5s] try to elect CL cla and after that there\n[256.4s] is first step of organization when you\n[259.4s] want to flee to the gospel order first\n[261.8s] we have to come to the organization but\n[264.2s] there's first step when we want to say\n[266.8s] that this body has been organized this\n[269.8s] first step that we got to follow can we\n[272.8s] read\n[274.3s] credential you have been told that that\n[276.8s] which give credit. Write that. That\n[280.1s] which gives credit, that which give a\n[283.0s] title or a claim to confidence, the\n[285.7s] warrant on which belief, credit or\n[288.2s] authorities claimed among strangers as\n[291.7s] the letters of commendation and power\n[293.7s] given by a government or ambassador or\n[296.1s] envoy which give him credit at a foreign\n[299.4s] court. So the powers of working miracles\n[302.1s] given to apostles may be considered as\n[304.6s] their credentials. authority to them to\n[307.4s] propagate the gospel and entitling them\n[310.4s] to credit. First word credential is that\n[315.0s] which give a\n[317.5s] credit. It means that when I have my\n[320.4s] credential, it means that I have been\n[322.9s] given a credit by this organization to\n[325.9s] go and propagate this thing. Are we\n[329.4s] okay? When I am in uncertain circle, I\n[332.7s] can been given a credit. I can been\n[335.2s] given a pro a water credential. Then\n[338.2s] when I go to another company which we\n[340.7s] are working with but not here in Kenya\n[343.1s] maybe in America I can show my\n[344.7s] credential they say ah you are our own\n[347.8s] we are in one organization we are in one\n[350.4s] circle to do this work. Are we\n[353.5s] okay? So why credential? Because there's\n[357.2s] something that tendency that has come to\n[359.5s] this church that was in seventh\n[361.4s] adventist church that when the church\n[364.2s] when we want to put this church in order\n[367.3s] in every way people there has been two\n[369.8s] what two mind that when we organize our\n[372.9s] church will come\n[374.1s] Babylon do people have those minds that\n[377.1s] when I organize I will lose\n[380.3s] my son give me the\n[384.0s] value when we organize\n[386.8s] that many people fear that when I\n[388.5s] organize I'm going to lose my influence.\n[390.4s] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do\n[391.9s] this. But before we organize, we must\n[394.5s] know that the first step of organization\n[396.6s] is ordination and\n[398.9s] credential. Ordination and credential.\n[401.2s] Go with me in the book of one\n[404.3s] bio. The book of one bio.\n[408.2s] The book of one\n[409.6s] by page\n[414.4s] 455. 455 paragraph number three. You\n[418.1s] hear first when the Mexican conference\n[420.2s] was organized because we have to know\n[422.2s] that 7th adventure general was organized\n[426.2s] in the year\n[427.3s] 1863 but Michigan conference was\n[430.3s] organized in the year 1861. So when the\n[433.3s] Mexican conference was organized what\n[435.1s] was the first step which was being\n[436.7s] taken?\n[438.0s] Read with me. It reads, it reads,\n[440.5s] \"Resolved that our minister papers\n[442.8s] consist of a certificate of orination.\"\n[444.7s] That it was resolved.\n[447.4s] Our minister's papers consist of\n[450.2s] certificate of ordination. First, the\n[452.0s] papers of ministers must consist of one,\n[455.2s] the certificate of coordination.\n[457.5s] Coordination. Let me ask you, can I have\n[460.2s] a certificate of coordination before\n[462.4s] reaching that coordination?\n[465.6s] for\n[467.9s] certificate. It means that someone being\n[471.6s] he must be\n[473.8s] scrutinized. His ways must be first\n[476.4s] investigated before being ordained. So\n[479.6s] fast they told that it was in that it\n[483.8s] was in\n[485.2s] par that that our minister's papers\n[488.7s] consist of certain valition also\n[492.2s] credentials to be signed by chairman and\n[497.0s] of the\n[498.1s] conference. So right the first step of\n[503.6s] coronation before writing that can you\n[507.0s] read a\n[509.6s] 18 a\n[512.0s] 18 uh act of apostle 18 act of apostle\n[517.0s] page 18\n[520.6s] it reads it reads it was at the\n[522.6s] ordination of the 12\n[525.0s] it was at the ordination of the 12 that\n[528.4s] the pastor step was taken in the\n[529.8s] organization of the church that the\n[531.4s] first step was taken in the ordination\n[533.8s] of the of the church. So when we want to\n[536.0s] call ourselves that we have organized\n[537.6s] into one body, what should we do?\n[539.4s] Ordination. Ordination. Praise God.\n[541.8s] Amen. That a church be without\n[543.6s] ordination without redemption. It is not\n[547.1s] organized. It is going to\n[549.7s] be praise God.\n[553.5s] [Music]\n[554.9s] Because the Christ has given was that go\n[559.0s] and bring the gospel baptizing them in\n[561.1s] the name of the father the son and the\n[563.3s] of the holy spirit in you. So it means\n[565.3s] that you cannot preach and bring people\n[567.4s] to church without baptizing them and\n[570.6s] without being bapt without baptizing\n[572.7s] someone it means that you must be\n[575.6s] ordained. So the first step of\n[577.5s] organizing church is doing what is\n[579.5s] called ordination. Are we clear at that\n[582.3s] point?\n[583.7s] So when we are in ordination is being\n[586.7s] given a credit to offer sacmental\n[589.5s] services the Lord that is number\n[593.3s] one mark that so let us go one by so\n[597.4s] when I I am being given credentials what\n[601.5s] should be done first a credential is\n[605.1s] being given to ministers there are\n[607.6s] credential can be given to ministers who\n[610.2s] are being ordained there are also\n[613.0s] Credential that can be given ministers\n[615.0s] to do to preach the gospel. Preach the\n[618.0s] gospel. Credential is what is called\n[621.0s] lense. Because we know the other day\n[623.5s] that in the year 1833 Miller was given\n[627.3s] license. But when did Miller started\n[631.1s] preaching?\n[632.9s] Yes. 1831. And he was licensed in which\n[636.4s] year? It means that I cannot just enter\n[639.0s] the gospel today and I am being given\n[641.8s] the credential today. Are we sure at\n[645.0s] that point I cannot enter the ministry\n[648.0s] to do the gospel work today and in this\n[650.5s] day or in this year being given a\n[652.2s] credential it cannot work. It is\n[655.0s] confusion and\n[659.3s] below that a\n[662.1s] credential should be signed by the\n[664.6s] chairman and the cler of the conference.\n[668.5s] That is number\n[670.4s] one. Number\n[672.9s] two that which credential shall be\n[676.0s] renewed\n[677.8s] annually? This credential shall be\n[680.1s] renewed annually.\n[683.4s] annually. Praise God.\n[686.5s] So it means that when I been given a\n[688.6s] credential in the next year this\n[690.9s] credential should be renewed that\n[695.5s] is they shall be renewed annually. So\n[699.0s] the\n[699.9s] question it means that if given a\n[704.5s] credential has\n[706.5s] been he has not been faithful in this\n[710.2s] work in the next year can\n[712.9s] he but let me ask you if I have been in\n[717.2s] this church and in the next church or in\n[720.9s] the\n[722.4s] next should I be ordained\n[726.5s] again should be ordained And then no. C\n[730.6s] O D 173. C O D\n[736.6s] 173. C O D\n[739.5s] 173. 171 not\n[742.3s] 1731 paragraph is paragraph number\n[744.8s] seven. Verse 21 paragraph 7.\n[748.9s] It reads paragraph 7. Paragraph 7 reads.\n[751.4s] If a person who has been ordained to the\n[753.3s] ministry, if a person who had been to\n[756.6s] the ministry on account of ma\n[760.1s] fails to have his credential renewed by\n[762.0s] the conference who fails to have it\n[764.3s] credential renewed to the conference is\n[766.6s] he in that condition authorized to\n[769.2s] baptize? Is he in that condition\n[771.7s] authorized to baptize to officiate at\n[774.4s] communion to officiate\n[777.0s] at communion and perform the marriage\n[779.7s] ceremony? to the\n[782.6s] point\n[784.7s] of according to the question number one\n[790.5s] he has to he can baptize he can baptize\n[793.6s] it mean that someone who is not being\n[795.4s] ordained cannot baptize that is number\n[797.9s] one\n[799.6s] the holy communion\n[801.6s] and communion can women be ordained\n[805.8s] it means that they can officiate holy\n[808.9s] communion thank you Number three, they\n[811.8s] cannot perform a marriage ceremony.\n[813.9s] Number three, they cannot perform\n[815.5s] marriage means an elder who not can\n[819.0s] perform a marriage\n[822.7s] ceremony. Go with me\n[825.0s] in\n[828.6s] 173. It is 173 paragraph number four. It\n[832.6s] reads, it reads, \"Would it be proper for\n[835.6s] one who has been ordained as an elder of\n[837.8s] a local church\n[841.6s] 173. Yes. Read now. Would it be proper\n[845.0s] for one who has been ordained Will it be\n[847.2s] proper for one who has been ordained as\n[849.6s] an elder of a local church of an elder\n[851.9s] of a local church but has not been\n[853.9s] reelected but has not been reelected in\n[856.6s] that church to take the lead in the\n[858.2s] breaking of bread? Can he lead in the\n[859.9s] breaking of the bread on baptism? That\n[861.7s] is a question. What is the answer? If he\n[864.1s] has been ordained as an elder church, if\n[866.3s] an elder has been ordained as an elder\n[868.3s] of this church and has been faithful in\n[870.2s] church duties, if that has\n[873.5s] been church duty although we moved to\n[876.5s] another\n[879.6s] church again, it might be for him to\n[882.4s] officiate request by the church. Amen.\n[890.0s] Can you again? It means that he has to\n[892.9s] lose his credential\n[896.0s] and before he can read again he must be\n[900.8s] scrutinized\n[903.1s] again that anger canain also ministers\n[907.7s] can\n[910.8s] be\n[916.8s] okay to be what should\n[919.9s] be P A P A N The time is there for\n[926.0s] you. Prepare your questions. I'm almost\n[929.3s] ending. PM PM\n[936.0s] from a trip I'm sure before ordination\n[939.6s] I'm not going to start\n[942.9s] topic\n[945.8s] min ordination paragraph paragraph\n[948.6s] number one ordination in the is the\n[951.0s] church's public recognition of divine\n[962.8s] Because this by the laying on of hands\n[969.0s] the church authorizes minister to teach\n[971.5s] the\n[973.7s] church authorize the church the church\n[976.9s] authorizes ministers to teach that is\n[979.8s] number one baptize to baptize and\n[982.2s] organize churches and organize churches.\n[984.9s] So who has been given to organize\n[987.0s] churches? The ministries. Who? The\n[989.7s] ministries. Ministers. And if a minister\n[992.2s] has been ored, how many works can you\n[994.1s] do?\n[995.1s] Then he can teach. Number two, baptized.\n[998.8s] Number three. Praise God. Amen. So after\n[1003.0s] that acts 13:1 before being sent forth\n[1006.8s] it says before being sent forth as\n[1008.8s] missionary to the heist ministers it say\n[1012.5s] but before being sent forth as\n[1014.2s] missionary\n[1016.8s] these apostles were solely dedicated to\n[1019.0s] God these apostles were solely dedicated\n[1022.2s] to God by fasting by prayer and by two\n[1027.0s] prayer and the laying on of hands and\n[1028.9s] number three by coordination.\n[1032.2s] has been authorized by the church. They\n[1035.1s] must be authorized by the church. Not\n[1037.5s] only to teach the not only if you are\n[1040.6s] not only to teach the truth but to\n[1042.4s] perform the rights of baptism but to\n[1044.3s] perform the rights of baptism and to\n[1046.3s] organize churches number two to organize\n[1048.4s] churches being invested fullical\n[1051.9s] authority to teach the truth to baptize\n[1055.0s] and organize churches. So\n[1057.1s] before baptize you must\n[1060.0s] be that your ordination must be\n[1062.4s] authorized by the church. I can hear.\n[1074.6s] Thank you. Number two reads before the\n[1080.0s] nation and ministers write this that\n[1082.5s] beforeation\n[1084.0s] miners should give evidence that they\n[1085.9s] have dedicated themselves the\n[1088.0s] work should give their obligation that\n[1091.1s] they dedicated their works to themselves\n[1093.6s] the work. So if that minister is lagging\n[1096.4s] here to here to here and dedicate\n[1098.8s] yourself to God\n[1103.8s] can dedicated his word to\n[1107.5s] God but to God.\n[1112.6s] There must be evidence on the part of\n[1114.5s] those who take the song position of the\n[1116.2s] shepherds that they have without\n[1118.8s] reservation to be given themselves to\n[1121.0s] the word. You must dedicate yourself\n[1123.1s] first to the work of God. They must take\n[1126.4s] Christ as their personal savior. They\n[1128.3s] must take Christ as their personal\n[1129.8s] savior. Hands laid upon men to ordain\n[1132.4s] them for the ministry before they are\n[1134.0s] thoroughly examined. Hands are laid upon\n[1137.0s] them to the ministry before they are\n[1138.7s] thoroughly examined as to their\n[1140.6s] qualification for the sacred. But how\n[1143.6s] much better would it be to make work\n[1146.2s] before accepting them as ministers?\n[1148.5s] But how much better would it be to make\n[1151.2s] thorough work before accepting them as\n[1154.2s] ministers than to have to go through\n[1156.7s] this rigid examination? That to have to\n[1159.0s] go through this rig examination become\n[1162.2s] established in their position. Yes. And\n[1165.0s] I'm not\n[1174.5s] it must be scrutinized. Number one.\n[1178.0s] Second\n[1184.0s] item. There are two things in the\n[1186.8s] ministry of God and the work of God.\n[1188.9s] They are only licensed ministers and\n[1191.3s] they are also ordained minister. I can\n[1194.3s] be licensed as minister or I can be\n[1196.5s] given a credential as a minister but I\n[1198.7s] cannot baptist. I wish I get at that\n[1203.1s] point. I can be licensed and I will\n[1206.3s] bring the truth but I cannot do what you\n[1209.4s] baptist. I cannot be baptized.\n[1213.2s] Can you do one\n[1215.6s] bio page 2 bio 173 biome\n[1222.2s] 173 173 The paragraph is paragraph\n[1225.7s] number one. Can you hear me? In the year\n[1228.0s] 1867, what has happened? And I give you\n[1231.0s] the age of baptism that has been in the\n[1235.6s] 173 number one. The statistical report\n[1238.6s] of the conference session list 28 today\n[1241.8s] ministers\n[1243.9s] say\n[1246.1s] the statistical report of the conference\n[1248.1s] session. This is the statistical report\n[1250.3s] on the conference side in the year 1867\n[1254.0s] listed 28 ordained ministers. How many\n[1256.4s] ordained ministers?\n[1258.0s] 28 ordained ministers. 10 licensed\n[1261.2s] minister. 10 licensed ministers.\n[1264.8s] 4320.\n[1266.3s] Praise God. Amen. It means that I can be\n[1269.5s] I can be\n[1273.0s] lined. It means that not every ministers\n[1276.1s] can do can do baptism can do lot\n[1281.3s] marriage also also marriage praise God\n[1286.0s] ministers let any minister define just\n[1288.7s] baptizing and holding\n[1291.6s] or if you are not being also in this\n[1295.3s] work you will lose your predation and\n[1297.8s] your\n[1300.0s] ordination. So the church must ple into\n[1303.4s] gospel order that these doors that the\n[1306.8s] devils let in should be closed. So let\n[1311.2s] me give some of the examples of\n[1315.0s] the\n[1316.9s] ericated\n[1319.5s] miners. You write the year it was in the\n[1323.0s] year 1854.\n[1324.7s] You write\n[1326.2s] ADVP page\n[1328.5s] 14\n[1330.6s] ADVP Adventist Bion and Pictures Page\n[1334.4s] 14.2\n[1337.3s] age because some may say that what age\n[1340.9s] they receive one of this example\n[1344.0s] two number two it says it says John not\n[1350.6s] became a Sabbathke keeping Adventist he\n[1353.0s] became a Sabbathke keeping Adventist\n[1355.2s] through the labor of John Neon Andrews\n[1358.6s] of John Neon Andrews began preaching\n[1360.7s] immediately and was obeyed in 1854 began\n[1363.8s] preaching immediately.\n[1367.2s] He became a he says he became preaching.\n[1370.8s] He began preaching immediately. He began\n[1373.0s] preaching immediately. I was obeying in\n[1375.0s] the year 1854. Can you he was in which\n[1378.7s] year? 1854. 1854. At which year? Go to\n[1382.5s] the last words. It\n[1385.2s] says when he was only 22 years old. Can\n[1388.9s] you stud\n[1391.0s] it say was the first man to receive\n[1395.2s] was the first man to receive and who was\n[1398.0s] later to be known as the seventh day\n[1399.9s] child this when he was only 22 years\n[1404.7s] only 22 years old it means that a\n[1407.4s] minister of 22 years old andained if he\n[1411.4s] has been faithful in his work praise God\n[1416.2s] amen when he was 32 years\n[1418.8s] You can read with me page\n[1422.6s] 98.5 page 98 number\n[1429.4s] 598 number\n[1432.8s] five\n[1444.7s] 989 John Lboro Mhm. Huh? Page 98. 98.\n[1450.4s] Yes. Number five. Two by page 98. The\n[1454.2s] paragraph is paragraph number five.\n[1458.3s] It reads 98 paragraph 5. Yes. Go and\n[1463.0s] James. Can you if you can stress where\n[1465.2s] Smith was 32 years? Uh how it says says\n[1470.0s] the motion carried Smith was 32 years of\n[1473.0s] age. Smith was 32 years of age. I have\n[1476.2s] just the day before been ordained to the\n[1478.6s] ministry. The ministry at which 32 years\n[1485.2s] old are clear at that point the young\n[1488.4s] can be ordained the alo can be done what\n[1491.6s] can be\n[1493.2s] ordained. So it means that we want to\n[1496.5s] make a point of guidance we have given\n[1499.4s] authority to that day. The reason I have\n[1504.1s] shown you brother\n[1506.4s] John was because the although this\n[1511.7s] church in the year 1854 has not had a\n[1515.4s] strong organization but they had strong\n[1519.4s] leadership. No one could be recklessly\n[1522.6s] allowed to or baptize\n[1525.7s] before. So it means that when you guys\n[1528.7s] are being ordained\n[1531.1s] is considered. Can you read this\n[1535.3s] book\n[1540.5s] 360?

And I know\n[3017.0s] you know what the message means.\n[3021.8s] You read me SP1.5 as you prepare your\n[3024.6s] question. SPN\n[3029.5s] reads it reads I saw the nominal chart\n[3033.5s] page two\n[3036.3s] SPM\n[3047.9s] 3.8.8 It says it. So those who have been\n[3052.2s] drawing the churches\n[3056.7s] just read says it say I saw those who\n[3059.7s] have been baptized as the churches. I\n[3061.7s] saw that those who have been baptized as\n[3063.4s] going into the churches have to be\n[3065.0s] baptized again as the faith. They have\n[3067.1s] to be baptized again into the door or\n[3068.9s] they go missing. Those who have not been\n[3071.6s] baptized since 1844. Those who have not\n[3073.8s] been baptized since 1844. You have to be\n[3076.5s] before Jesus come. You have to be\n[3078.1s] baptized before Jesus comes.\n[3084.0s] This church will not progress. The\n[3085.8s] reason why our publishing house is not\n[3088.7s] working. Ministers are converted. Elders\n[3092.0s] are unconverted. The church members you\n[3094.6s] are not able to pro. Why? Because you\n[3098.1s] are not being\n[3099.7s] baptized. You have been baptized by\n[3101.8s] someone who does not allow the message.\n[3107.6s] If I could have time, we could read over\n[3110.4s] and\n[3113.9s] after I know you know what the third\n[3116.2s] angel's message\n[3118.8s] is. After the third angel's message, you\n[3121.7s] have to be rebaptized again. After\n[3124.1s] learning the Sabbath message, you have\n[3126.7s] to be rebaptized again. Let me conclude\n[3129.3s] at that\n[3132.2s] point. Can you read? Then I saw those\n[3134.8s] who stand making up the bridge and\n[3137.4s] standing in the former sees 184 written\n[3140.7s] the commandments and so follow the yes\n[3144.2s] as the first day instead of the seven.\n[3146.3s] Yes. See the light shown out of the\n[3149.1s] Muslim. Yes.\n[3152.0s] Given up the institutions of the pop.\n[3157.8s] Are you understanding?\n[3161.8s] [Music]\n[3165.7s] It reads, can you kindly understand this\n[3168.6s] kindly?\n[3170.6s] It reads, it reads, \"The night I saw\n[3172.8s] those whose hands are engaged in making\n[3174.6s] up the bridge, the night I saw that\n[3176.3s] those whose hand are engaged in making\n[3178.3s] up the bridge and are standing in the\n[3180.4s] gap and are standing in the gap that are\n[3182.6s] formerally since 1844 formerally since\n[3185.5s] 1844 broken the commandments.\n[3188.2s] The\n[3192.4s] commandment way of\n[3197.2s] eating\n[3199.7s] marri as to keep the first day instead\n[3202.2s] of the seven. You want to keep the first\n[3204.2s] day instead of the and you have seen the\n[3206.4s] light shone out of the most holy place.\n[3208.8s] See the light sh out of the most holy\n[3211.0s] place. Change their course. You must\n[3212.8s] change your course even at the\n[3214.6s] institution of the poor. You will leave\n[3216.7s] the institution of the word for the pop\n[3219.7s] and are keeping God's Sabbath would have\n[3222.6s] to go down into the water. You have to\n[3225.0s] go down into the waters and be baptized\n[3227.3s] in the faith of the sanctuary\n[3230.7s] and be baptized in the faith of the\n[3232.5s] sanctuary and keep the commandment of\n[3234.6s] God and the faith of Jesus. Praise God.\n[3236.8s] Amen. If you are baptized and you have\n[3238.7s] gone back to the institution of the\n[3240.9s] beast, Babylonian\n[3243.4s] institutions, you have to be rebaptized\n[3246.9s] again. How many have gone to the\n[3249.0s] institution of the beast after being\n[3251.3s] baptized? How many have been baptized by\n[3253.8s] the elders in the institutions of the\n[3256.0s] beast? You have to go down into the\n[3258.8s] water again. But you cannot go down to\n[3261.4s] the you will not have any progress.\n[3264.8s] there will be no progress in\n[3269.6s] you. I don't know how to explain\n[3274.8s] but too many years this person.\n[3284.8s] Praise God. Any question?\n[3291.8s] That's not a comment. Yeah."

You see I'm wondering but you'll be telling us your name first and then you ask how many do you welcome? Yes. Would you give him a mic of Yes, it's working. Good evening. My name is Baraka and I'm glad to be here. So, I'm much can say confused or uh what term can I use? Yes. But allow me read the book of John chapter 17 verse uh verse 15 before I ask my question. This Jesus praying I pray that thou should shouldest take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from the evil. So uh my question goes to uh the handle topic in the afternoon true education. All of us here I believe you are schooled and uh if not I don't know but for me personally I've uh finished campus 844 system and currently I'm looking for an employment and uh in the presentations I heard that anyone working or schooling in Babylonian institution in the last days in which we are right now will uh all or parents taking their children to Babylonian schools or institutions will receive the mark of the beast. So I'm asking and this is a very serious question. The book of Daniel chapter one we see Daniel and his brothers taken to Babylon. Nemiah working as a cup bearer in uh in the king's palace. Yes, he was. Daniel and his brothers were in Babylonian king kingdom and they were working in the palace and yet they were faithful. We see Nemiah too working as a cup bearer in the king's palace. So I was asking myself as a saved member uh is it wrong to be employed for example I'm I'm a an accountant and a finance analyst if I'm employed in an institution uh in fact we were told that Babylon and the Rome as has taken over almost every institution sor even the government itself. See if I'm employed in any government institution or non-governmental institution. Is it wrong? That my first question. The second question uh in this room I know the PA system, the laptops, our phones, our dress codes, our everything are made from these institutions. the system, our phones and everything are made from all this. So I'm I'm a little bit confused. So I need much clarification that if indeed uh we are to reform in true education, what line a clear line will will we take or will I take personally? because maybe I've not learned much from other lessons but that was my first lesson and lastly if I get children if I'm married I'm not married if I be married my children what form like when the the seven adventist church began in in in 1863 there were institutions there were sanitariums there were schools in these last days one true god Do we have institutions? Do we have sanitariums? Because if I have a wife, my wife wants to be want to deliver. Will I not take her to a Babylonian oipital or any well will I take her my children all that when they are sick? Not let let me not speak of health reform but let let me speak of other institutions. So even the IT men here all of us we learn these skills there. Even Daniel and the brothers, they learn those skills. They Moses being trained in the king's palace. So that's my question. Thank you. Thank you. Answers the Bible three stories are spiritual. How many answers? 1 2 3 I ask you be short. Yes. To the point. Happy happy Sunday. Happy Sunday. Uh thank you. Uh I want to be short and precise but I want to say this as I begin. Let the Bible speak. Uh he has given a case study of Nemiah. Daniel that is where I want us to begin from. Uh if you go to the book of Daniel, let's begin from the book of Daniel chapter 1 so that we get the answer of his question first. Daniel chapter 1 we are beginning from verse number one. Daniel chapter 1 and the verses one. The scripture reads in the third year of the reign of Joakim the king of Judah came the king of Babylon and Jerusalem and besieged it. The Lord gave Joim the king of Judah into his hands with part of the vessels of the house of God which he had carried into the land of Shina the house of his God. And he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his God. And the king spake unto Ashpenas the master of the Unix that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and of the king's sin and of the princes. Go to verse four. Read with me and you understand the Bible. Children in whom was no blemish. But Lord, skillful in all wisdom and turning in knowledge, understanding, science and such had the ability in them to stand in the king's palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongues of the childins. So from that point we get the requirement of Nebuchadzza to Ashenaz concerning the unex whom he was to bring. So the question comes what was they to learn in Babylon? They were to learn the language of the child beans because these people already they had one understanding of wisdom turning in all knowledge and understanding science and such had the ability in them to stand in the king's palace. So they had that you read the book who was the place a book called place in Bible education. Do you have it there? I want I want a hard copy. I only mark in the hard copy. If you go to the book place of Bible education in education bring me the hard copy. I want to read something on that written by Adono Trevia Jones. It will tell you that these people had the understanding from where? Get me the book parts and prophets pay 2 596. Yeah, that's what I want. Help me with it. You come and buy this book. He's only 600 shillings. I want us to read the book place of Bible education. Get me the book parts and prophet page 596. Education of Daniel. Uhhuh. So I want you to read this. Go to chapter 8 of the place of Bible education. Please go with me very fast. That chapter 8 it should be page 67 in this book 596. You read lesson before I read this I want to give the Bible principle alone. So these people were accounting in everything that they required. Okay, let's move to chapter 2 of Daniel uh chapter one sorry. So after that there was a test that this were to pass and that test Daniel and the fellow said don't give us the food from the king's me king's table but give us water and you know the things okay so I want you to prove this verse 12 prove thy servant I beseech thee 10 days and let them give us pulses to eat and water to Then let our countenance be looked upon before thee, and countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat, as thou seeest, deal with thy servants. So he consented with them in this matter, and prove them 10 days. Verse 15 is very critical. At the end and at the end of the 10 days the accountants what you can look appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat. One thus took away the portion of their meat and the one that they should drink and gave them passes. As for these four children, God gave them one knowledge, two skills in learning and wisdom. And Daniel had understanding in all vision and dream. Verse 18. Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, the princes the unic brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar and the king communed with them. And among them all was found none like Daniel, Naniah, Michelle and Nazar. Therefore today they before the king. Verse 20. And in all matters all matters is it left out? Is it left out? Is farming left out? What about globe making and dress cutting? What about electrical engineering? Call it. What about flying aircraft? What is left out in all? Y all is like I'm reading God has the ability to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. So it says and in all matters of what is called wisdom and knowledge and understanding the king inquired that the king inquired of them. He found them 10 times better than all one magicians. Two, three, everyone. So I'm asking this question to you. I'm posing a bit. Listen to my question. Whom do you think were the lecturers in Babylon at this time? I'm reversing the my question again. Whom do you think were the lecturers or the teachers in Babylon at this time teaching and lecturing Daniel, Azariah and Michelle? See the same magicians and astronomers. Okay, that is when you go to Daniel chapter 2, you get that they do not understand why the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God. God is good. Which knowledge do you think you can be 10 times wiser than your lecturer? Yes. Which knowledge do you think you can be 10 times wiser than your parents who are still in Babylon? So where do you think they got this knowledge? Where I want to give you where they got the knowledge. More with me. If you have the book less of Bible education, I want you listen to what I read. Page 68. Now blemish and wellpowered. This will require that they should be physically sound, wellbe and symmetrical. The world trans wisdom, knowledge and science is vers Hebrew is death, murder, pogma and are cruc the second is extension of the first, the third and the second. So listen. Therefore the requirement of kingzar in selecting of this youth was that they should be physically sound. Is that right? symmetrical belt and that mentally they should be one skillful in deciding what is called valuable knowledge. Do you know what's called valuable knowledge? Do you know what's called valuable knowledge? Huh? The valuable knowledge is this. You have the ability to discern when to plant. Is that a knowledge that is valuable which adds value? Uhhuh. skillful ability to acquire such knowledge turning in the acquisition of knowledge by thinking and application. You get this point. You know many people go to school they think but where to apply is the problem. And I ask you this question where do you apply Pythagoras theorem in the real world? Who has been told where to apply Pythagoras theorem in the real world? Yes. Who knows where to apply Pythagoras theorem in the real world? So this is what these people had the ability to discern and acquire that knowledge and where to apply it. Understanding how to correlate, classify, systemize the knowledge which they had faculty discern was valuable knowledge and which they were cunning in gathering. So let me take you where they acquired that knowledge. Go to the book of 1 Samuel. I'm telling them where they acquire the knowledge as to stand up. 1st Samuel 19:20. Read with me. 1st Samuel 19:20. And also 2 Kings 6 1-6. I'm reading that. Then we just finish. Yes. Yeah. And Saul sent messengers to take David. And when they saw the company of the prophets Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So then we just stop there. So it's this there was the schools of the prophets before these children of Israel were c were taken captive. So this all knowledge that was revealed in the Babylonian as a country by then was acquired in the schools of the prophets. Two, these men were living under the guidance of their parents. Okay? So their parents were building a character within heaven. So there's a part of a parent to play in character building. Read me that PP 596. PP 596. We are I'm done with my answer. PP 596. Just start from paragraph one. Uh-huh. Mhm. Mhm. The great life work of life is character building. In the knowledge of God is the foundation of all true education to impart this knowledge and to know the character in the knowledge with heat. So the object of teachers work is that. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Mhm. Go to go to page 595. Uhhuh. Yes. 59. Let me read. It says uh le in the in the days of 593 paragraph 2. In some days there were two schools. One at Rama the home of the prophets another at Jerim where the ark then was others were established in their times. The people of this school sustain themselves by their own labor in tilling the land. So one we need to study what is called ABC education tilling the land or in some mechanical employment. Uhhuh. In Israel it was thought strange or degrading. Indeed, it was regarded as a crime to allow children to grow up in ignorance of useful labor. By the command of God, every child was storm some trade. Uhhuh. Even though he was to be educated for holy office. So the main object of education in Israel was for what? Redemption. And holy office was to preserve for them. But as far as that, they were also to do what is called mechanical work, toiling the land. Last many of the religious teachers supported themselves by manual labor even so late as the time of the apostle Paul and Achil Aquilia no less honored because they earn lively by their trade of dent making. So that is it. Okay. Welcome. The next person who is coming just to be shorting myself in the Are you coming to preach or I want us to be very short because if I want to ask questions and you take 20 minutes please. So I will be doing something there. something as soon too many. You just say this, this this maybe tomorrow. Praise God. Uh I'm going to answer I think one question that uh should I be employed by the government if I believe the truth may okay let us go to the book of proverbs chapter 22. The main reason why people are being employed number one people want to live a good life, riches, wealth and hope and honor in the society. 22 of Proverbs read verse 4. It says by and so those three things that that matter so much in the life of any person living they are being got by to the fear of the lord and the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge now I want to answer the second one should I train it we talk about we have children where should we take them to learn something like that. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah. That one I'm going to take you to the book of the same same book. Proverbs 22 verse number six. It says train up where you should go. Uhhuh. So train up a child. uh I don't know if this instruction was given to the teachers in the school but I think the same as parents and uh that includes fathers and and mothers you brought a study of um a study of uh about uh Daniel and the the three Hebrew brothers I think I remaining with one minute I I will just give you a book there's a book known has story of Daniel the prophet. There is a a chapter or written a true education and uh I will not read everything. I will explain for you so you go and read uh after the announcement by prophet Isaiah that the Babylonians will be be coming to this city to destroy it and to take some of the vessels of God to their land. Mothers and the parents who are whoard about this started teaching their kids the sin the history of Israel were studied and the story of Nadab and Abihu was told and retold. They were being taught through songs and also they were being also taught about the effect of health uh bad health in the family like the effect of strong dream was impressed upon the mind. the laws of his own being was studied. He knew that excess in eating and drinking will s the mind that the voice of God could not be heard. Um I'm I'm still looking a text that will tell me that Daniel was was employed in Babylon. I think it was a forced labor. Was there that Daniel was employed and was receiving a certain amount of money every month? I think is there it was employed but receiving amount of money building even houses even ordering some cars from abroad so I'm still looking for that verse if there is then Daniel was employed in Babylon and receiving yes teacher of education come will be all of you cannot answer this questions amen You can only ask another one. I'm going to be very brief. The first verse that was read is John 17:15 that says that keep them from evils of the what? The world is is what it that they in the world but need they need to be kept from the evils of the what? It says out of the world. Out of the world. The first principle to keep somebody out of the evil is to separate him from the the world. Number two, there's a question that has been asked about Daniel commented on it. I want just read a quotation on where Daniel obtained his education. So that when we are talking about number one need to know that those people where they education I'm reading place of the Bible in education page 80 paragraph one very fast says that the specification distinctly made in the scriptures so it should be projected place of Bible in education page 80 paragraph one very fast it reads Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Mhm. Mhm. Uh-huh. Mhm. It is not small tribute to the educational ideas. Indeed, this view of education as the Bible as shown in the verse of the Bible were for all practical what purposes advance of the educ system fine and advanc educational system. By the way, what required from those people was advanced education that the one that exists today. Read the next statement. Even the leading college and universities of the United States. So what was even higher than the education that was providing the universities and colleges of United what states? Yet yet Daniel Daniel and successfully were able successfully such to pass such an examination where then they said such education that exceeded even the education that was provided in the university. Uhhuh. But you the answer to this question the answer to this question is having worth having. Besides, besides we need it just now. All this was done for last days. Next paragraph. Daniel, where did Daniel? You see people says that Daniel were taken to what? Babylon. Get this. Get this. Where then? Daniel and his three companions. The educational enabled them successfully to pass them skillful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and science all these things withoutation it can be answered in a school in the schools of what? So during the times of prophets there was a what? A school. Read the divinely established school. The divinely established school in what? So in Israel there was a school established. Continue reading. There was at that time there was that that time what school of the what? In Jerusalem. In Jerusalem in the year of king of Judah. So we need to understand that the the likes of Daniel I could have read many things but the Daniel obtained an education in the university on Israel. Okay. Number two. Number two. 1 28 paragraph 2 says that God's purpose in giving the third angel's message. God's purpose in giving the angels message to the world to prepare people to stand true to him during the investigative what? Judgment. This is the purpose for which we establish and maintain our publishing houses. Our what? Our schools, our sanitariums, hygienic restaurants, treatment what? treatment rooms and factories factories. This is our purpose in carrying forward the work in every word every life. Okay. So God's purpose to carry the message is that we have our own our own school. Hallelujah. The last thing I'm saying is that not all the knowledge that is in the world is unnecessary. Are we together? What Satan is doing is mingling truth and air. You go to place of Bible education, you realize that even in our schools where we have to maintain this in our schools there are things that we have to teach. One of them language must be taught, geography must be taught, must be taught anatomy and physiology must be music must be done what must be taught. Amen. And therefore when the Lord has brought a knowledge that will help in carrying on the gospel, that knowledge will be accepted by God's people, God's people. So long as that knowledge will not confuse them the mind and lead to what to say. Amen. Others will be handled in the next lessons in Jesus name. You want to answer or you want to ask a question? Question is coming. Yes. this many hands. Put your hands down like you ask the question still being answered. Yes. The context for my question. The context for my question was is it wrong to be to study or to be employed in that institution? Not the not the what being taught is wrong because I think the there should be a simultaneous application whereby parents can teach the way Daniel and the others were taught and then that the knowledge from home will help them to survive in those so my questioning me and I go and work there is it just to go and work or is it wrong just leaving it wrong? So that means those who be answering the questions, you don't even note them down. You love answering, you don't note. Yes. Amen. So note the questions so that you may not come and don't answer. Now who want to answer that? If you have noted so that you may not come and start out a study till the somebody who ask a question is wondering am I being answered? Yes, but at least you have gotten that Daniel did not go to Babylon to study. In fact, Daniel chapter one is written that he had all knowledge and wisdom. By the way, they had everything while with us we are going to school to acquire those knowledge. But they all all knowledge, wisdom, full of science all things and in fact it is written that the knowledge wanted cannot even be found in University of United States. So that means those people went there when already they prepared. The question was where did they get the education they got it from the what back at their home? Somebody came here who read that they were taught even health at home. Even their standing with health message in Daniel in Babylon was not an accident. It was not what an is the first principle. Even when you are going to be answered going to work there. Number two, it was also a command of God that let them go to Babylon. Remember God told Jeremiah said that those who will refuse will be killed. But again our command now is not to go to Babylon. It is to come out of Babylon. Our command is different. Their command was to go bon all of you that y is coming put your y ours is to come out of so we have to look line upon line the other line and this line and connect somebody to come and ask yes yes felix come and then we are you will the rest will answer the next questions is still the same so thank you 2 minutes 2 minutes yes go is I want to read one verse. 1 Corinthians 6:17 I think says that 6:17 verse from verse 14 very fast the Bible reads the praise of the Lord is it second or 2 Corinthians 6:14 the Bible reads be not equally y together with unbelievers both fellowship as righteousness or unrighteousness Yes. What is what communion as light with darkness? So who is unbeliever do not be collect together with unbeliever who is unbeliever. Who is unbeliever? So we cannot we cannot be united with someone in business transaction. White says that we cannot even be united in business transaction with those who do not believe what with those who do not believe the the present. So it is wrong. It is wrong to be employed in such a school in in in worldly employment because they are unbelievers. You cannot work among them because you have a precious truth. So I wanted to read read the last quote education page 77. says that where Christ also receive his education so we are not to be employed by worldly as I read that I am quoting great controversy page 491.2 2 says that while men will be absorbed in business pursuit their probation will be what? Closing. Amen. So you cannot be employed in worldly institution if you have these truths. Page 77.1 I think the value of principle. No I want to read the last last statement says that is education directly from heaven. Now listen where we need to obtain directly from heaven appointed sources. Gain directly from appointed sources. This education was gained direct directly from heaven appointed sources. From useful work. Number one useful useful work from the study of the scriptures. Study of the B of study of the scriptures of nature. Nature and from the experience of life. The experience of what? Those are the four syllabus. So we are not going to be employed by the word useful work, scriptures, nature. Amen. I think I'm done. So as uh as comes the simple answer is you can put [Music] here will be a direct answer to your question. It is very direct. You you have to come forward. Can we allow come forward? Just come forward so that we maybe maybe Yes. Okay, good evening. My question is on it was yesterday that go was teaching about talents and he was saying that if you abandon one bar one talent you be responsible for it isn't it that so I'm asking there is an example you give that if you have a talent of business and the same time you are for farming And business if you can come to the real world business is mostly empowered with worldly things. So if I abandon those business that is associated with worldly things and go to farming which is not which is useful and not worldly. So will life be responsible for that? And the another question is there is this practical institutions that we go and learn something like maybe construction of our own houses. Are they bad? And if they are bad, which way forward? And I think the last question is this or these items we are using here even cooking are made from the worldly instructions and if we shall stop using them and maybe return to the maybe if it is cooking we return to ports. So I hope from tomorrow we will be cooking using pots not free if it is. Thank you. Good evening. We thank God for all these privileges to be together to share these messages and we hope the Lord is leading us. One thing I believe is that the Lord wants us to be balanced in everything and to follow the voice of truth and make decisions. Amen. So I know the questions that the brother ask us the last questions uh let me begin with the other one first though brother Maxwell has promised that he will blow something there which will solve everything uh on the question but let me give my view as a people as we stand today as the teacher for true education has said we have lost our birthight you know we sold it Um those people who followed our pioneers they sold us away. They never maintained our schools. We had Lalinda, we had Madison school, we had Battle Creek Colleges. These places were superior. If you study the history of the great depression, economic depression in 1929, when the secretary of education of the United States of America visited Madison school, he said, \"All American schools should be ordered in this manner.\" They were running in the best way possible that any government school will wish to run. We sold it away. We lost it. What we are doing in this generation is we are crying out for restoration of those places. So this voice that is crying right now is not pointing us at a place where we have but saying we have lost it, we want to regain it. Amen. So by saying those places have a problem is a voice calling that we should go back to something which we must do practically not just by words. So when we said those places are evil let me just put it now in a few words after saying that my brother has already said not everything in the world is negative. The problem is that there is a mingling of error and what and truth. And the Lord wants us to establish places where we can find truth in its purity. That's the thing. And we want to move there slowly. We don't want to speak as though we already have the places. No, we are heading to that direction. And that's our cry as a people. So, brother, we do not have such places. The Lord wants us to establish such a places and we are beginning that work first by accepting that we have missed the point and now we can begin from here going towards that direction and for our children we are making preparations so that they will not be partakers of these places. I'm speaking because my child is not yet of age. For those whose children are of age, they have already made a decision to begin doing it. You get the point. So and as a church we must take up this work and lead it to the father's place. Um one still one example suffer me brother. Uh Hezekiah when he was visited by the ambassadors from Babylon they were Ezekiah was supposed to tell them about the true God right and how he had gotten healed. But instead he showed him all the things that he had. And the Lord said the days are coming when your children even born of yourself shall be taken to Babylon. Shall they shall be made unax and they shall serve the king. So Daniel and his friends never served in Babylon because they they loved it. No, it was not that way. God really gave them privileges because they respected God. So that the king of Babylon treated them with favors. But see, they were made unox. Do you know what that means? They were castrated. Think about that. Can anyone go to school to be castrated? No. No. No. No. I really don't think so. They never served out of their own willingness. And if we are going to serve out of our own willingness, you realize that we are selling ourselves. So I will say personally in this regard I'm sorry I am just re finding it hard to summarize this thing because I found the question so heavy. Should I end it there or I still say something? Two minutes more just two more minutes. So what I wanted to say is these things that we are using here are not evil. We started yesterday. We realized that the spirit of invention that gift comes from who? From the Lord. It may be misaligned. But can't we if we install this system of education, can't we be able also to even invent such things? I'm persuaded if the adventist never lost that, we will be very far much ahead of the world. We're sure we will be the ones doing these things and not going there to acquire that knowledge. You get the point? higher than the highest human thought is God's ideal is God's ideal for his children and that's it. Now the rest of the questions the brother has asked I still have lessons in my class and especially what he said I will capture it because I will be talking about what sections of businesses and what sections of works we can engage. Some of them are secular but acceptable. You get the point. And some are Christian in practice. I mean they are gospel like running a publishing place. It makes money yet it is for gospel reasons. But if you are a mass it's not heralding the gospel proper but it is innocent. That one is not evil. So I'll talk about those businesses in my series on classes. So let me just end it there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you brother for you will be answered even at education is not ended brother if you come every day again this one now this is GCDB s your question is direct GCDB's general conference bulletin do you believe the spirit of prophecy yes I believe let's read Where should we start? A question worth asking. If my money belongs to the world, yes. Do I belong to the church? Uhhuh. If my abilities are put to the work of the world as of the world of the church as of the church then the Christian consider I belong to the church myself that our attention the Christian how much me how much is And it is a question worth asking. If my money belongs to the world, do I belong to the church? If my talent, my abilities are put into the work of the world as of the world and not the work of the church as of the church. The question is worth considering. Do I belong to the church myself? That turns our attention to the question, how much does it take to compose me? How much is there of a man? Do you have a man here at this faculty yonder is about in another place and the fruit of f of his faculty, the fruit of his abilities, the result of his life and endeavor in yet another place. Could that be the man be here? All of him. No sir. All my faculties, all the fruits of my life must wear. If I myself am to be there. We cannot escape that then do I belong to the church? Do I? That is the question. Does 75,000 uh 7th Adventist belong to the church? 75,000 700 belongs to the church. Do we that is the question to illustrate. So get illustration. Get illustration. Do all these people who are sitting here belong to this channel? That is the question. So illustration now to illustrate illustrate now listen suppose I have my name on the church book belong to the church I'm a school teacher and I'm spend all my time all my endeavor all my ability all my faculty as a school teacher in the world school teaching and teaching in the world school the world's in the world's way the world's education it is worth asking do I belong to the church am I loving the church and giving myself whatever I may profess my faculty my life what am I in the ability which god has given me I am giving it to the world for the world's work and the world's purpose that is so that I am loving the church and give myself do I belong the church suppose I am a physician and I give my ability my talent my faculties my life and I the world's way of what is called medicine the world's way of treating diseases. I stand as a member of the church as belong to the church. I am to be sanctified and cleansed the washing of water with the word of God and that word of God that is given to the church the divine the true system medical treatment the true philosophy and treatment with regard to health disease right living and all these things. I belong to the church to be sanctified and cleansed the washing of water by that word. Instead of doing what that word gives to me to which I am committed as belonging to the church, I take that world gives and devote to the world. What which I get from the world and I belong to the church. Do I? I belong to the church for the purpose of being sanctified. Is that making us not to get this? Okay. I belong to the church for the purpose of being sanctified and cleansed with the washing of water by the word of God to the church. There is in that word and that word itself is a system of education. That is the true and the only true education. I say I belong to the church but I am satisfied with the world's education with the world's system of education with the world's philosophy of education and I devote my life to that I want to know do I really belong to the church it is precisely I think these things would not get this cuz they are not consequence like that no no now repeat this one there's in that one and Yeah, there is that word and that word itself is a system of education. That is the true that is the only true education. I say I belong to the church but I'm satisfied with the world's education, the world's system education, the world's philosophy education. I devote my life to that. I want to know do I really belong to the church? It is precisely so also as to medical or any other profession. So all processions you can have you take but somebody also to get saying taking six days in the pagan institution and one day then you only have a day somebody to get that I still continue and I am a man of other affairs in the world whether it be business or farming or carpenter work. I mean the every commercial business world I stand as belong to the church and the efforts which I put forth of thought or endeavor the blessings of God upon it all increase comes I put it in the worldly bank I'm not a speculator I belong to the church but here is the means God has given to me as a member of the church and I put it into the worldly bank I loan it to the worldly men to be used in worldly business instead of in the work of the church to which I belong Then it is fair question for me to ask do I belong to the church? This reference to illustrate and now there's not one here of these delegates. These delegates you are in the delegates the delegates. It's enough to illustrate. And now there's not one here of these delegates who cannot look all over this land and see thousands upon thousand 7th Adventist who stand in a position as belonging to the church. Which leaves a wide open question for you and to ask do I belong to the church? And everyone here knows that if all seven adventists in the United State from this day and forward who really belong to the church, you yourself will confess that there is no question at all but that this message could be given to the world in this generation. You can only why this message cannot go now to the church but we are in church. a world person in where the church but not a member and a you can all say amen to that. You know that that is so then you see you going to say amen but you know it is so and then you see brethren the problem is not difficult. The problem is not difficult. It is just this question to be decided. It is not difficult. This issue of education is not what it is just this question to be what decided by it is just to be discussed by each one or himself. The youth must decide for himself. Do I belong to the church? You are going to come out of this meeting. You can work in the world. But again, do you and Christ is coming to take the church. Christ is coming to take a church. Do I belong to the church? Where next? Oh now shall I not shall not I find myself my faculties or my means wrapped up in the work of the world used in behalf of the world or engage the world's work shall not I will not you wall it away from there and put the church's work in the course of the church in the earth to which I belong let that be done and you know that spiritually it will shake this worlds out of its place think of it if only seventh advent in the United States would really consider this allow the church give themselves with their children give their themselves with their children do you know why our schools are failing when they began education where is the money of the advent going the world even these schools who who building who are in the who are board members who are the teachers there are they members of this church those who are teaching in the worldly schools Do we have members in our church here and in our school? What if these talents were used in the church? What if all these talents all were used in the church now and it says yes let that be done and you know that spiritually it will shake this world out of its place. Think of it. If all seven adventists in United States really consider this, love the church, give themselves with their children for the church and to the church, how would our schools work stand? Imagine if all of us it will be stand where it ought and such consecration as that will bring such power from heaven that the teaching will be saved will be easy. The lack of teachers will not be such as it is now. So now we don't even have teachers. We even collect things that should not be collected. Hallelujah. You collect those who have talent in the world. Hallelujah. They know how to teach best. You would have not lacked teachers. The language teachers will not be such a hindist. No. And so with all the rest, if all seven day Adventist in the land will turn their families and Christian education and all our families, if we can turn our families to Christian education and the education that becomes the church and education that becomes the church. And the world is calling for the church to give. The world is calling the church to give that education. And because he has just said in 1929 somebody went where? to to the medicine and see this is the what see and now shall I not find myself and my faculties or my mean grabs in the work of the world use the world or engage in the work world's work shall I not shall not I will not you away from there and put the child's work elites cause of the charge in the earth to which I belong Somebody's joking here. He's not with us. Yes. Be with us. Please be church. Be church. Amen. And so with all the rest, if all the seven in the land will turn their families under Christian education, education that that becomes the church and that the world is calling for the church to give and for the want of which and because of the lack of which the world itself is saying that the church in education is a distinctly diminishing quantity. If this were done, the world would easily be rich in this generation. So how can the world be rich in this generation? only through what? There's no way we can reach them. Not through crusades. Okay. If we do crusades and we don't have the true education, we rather stop preaching cuz we are forming churches that are going to be Babylon again. What has made the general content to be Babylon is because of the education of the world. Amen. It is time that there should be one church in the world that will rise and be not a mission quoted in education but be the whole thing in education. If the seventh day Adventist will really give themselves the church loving it giving themsel for it with all their talents all their means all their powers then the whole problem will be solved. So why do we have a problem? There are people inside this movement but they have refused to be the judge members. That is why we have a problem. Separation will come again. People want to be united. We talk we talk of unity. And by the way, that book says that in 1860s the church was busy talking of unity and organization while their children were going to the what? World education. That was the problem including the daughter of the prophet. when when he died the children of public school came and uh Sudaland says that was the problem. They were busy talking of church organization. Unity we need to come together. Unity. What are we talking about now? See unity and organization. But they are saying true education was to bring what? Unity. Unity. So it is the same. This is the problem we have. Some people in the inside here but they're not church members. They're not church members. That is the only problem. It is the problem is not management. People are not church members. Yeah. Says if the seventh adventist will really give themselves to the church, loving it, giving themselves for it with all their talents, all their means, all their powers, then the whole problem will be solved. The world facilities are abandoned. In brother Daniel's discourse last night that was presented to us all, brother Conrad today showed how the fields are open and all ready and the harvest. The prophecies are in a convention like we are. Uhhuh. The prophecies so abundant so that abundant by the way the prophecies we have been learning here talking of what see schools I will show you the commandments in schools now they look the so prophecies are what prophecies so abundant showing that now there's time that have been presented let these people present ourselves to Christ today loving the being the church, giving ourselves for it. Giving ourselves for the church. These people I say present ourselves to Christ as his church to love that church to give yourself for it and to give yourself to it with all our our you are not even reading these things with all efforts all the fruit effort of whatsoever kind Uh-huh it will be as sweet was before this will be a holy church. So what will make a holy church? When we give ourselves for the church to the church and in the church and for the church and to the church this will be a holy not having a wrinkle or any such thing. The church the pill and the ground of I will study student who always teach what the church is. Do you tell them about this education? church without a wrinkle. See? Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Is this church having a wrinkle and spot? Serious. Hallelujah. The church is the pill on the ground. And that was what in 2021 we were in this hall and that is where organization started was I want my church back. Oh, and this was the this was this was 1 Timothy 3:14 and 15. It was our look at that church. Church is the church is the pill on the ground. The support that the stay of the truth in the world. The only means for me this world can ever obtain truth is by the church. By the church. It may be that the church like the church of Israel and Judah will of itself voluntarily spread that truth abroad to the world. The people may like Israel and Judah shut themselves within themselves. Shut themselves within themselves and turn the truth of God away. Put other things in its place. shut themselves away from the world and thus failed to give it to the world. But if that must be so then that church will be scattered. So this church is going to be scattered again. Uhhuh. As was Israel and as was Judah amongst the nation of heathen and they in oppression and in bondage. So that is how seventh day Adventist found themselves in bondage again. the nations will find the truth through the church. So whichever way it may be, the only way that the nation can get the truth is from the church. So imagine see we took our children and they were scattered in the bondage but still truth came even in those universities did they get those truths? people got it. Another way if you joke and you think you escaping this Why don't you say amen? Amen. The only way that God's truth can preach the nation is through the church. Therefore, this is how it is that the church of Christ who is the body of the Christ of Christ is the bail and the ground, the support and the stay of the truth in the world. It is that which keeps alive the truth in the earth. Yes. How then how then can the world obtain the truth from me from me as of the church of the church. When all my effort listed this question this question sister is going but you will come back and check it. Amen. Yes. This is important question. Yes it together. How then can the world obtain the truth from me of the church? So the church when all my efforts all your efforts are enlisted are what? Enlisted and spend the occupation. My brother, are you seeing this? How then can the world bring good from you when 6 days you are employed in Lala community as of the church? As of the church then all my efforts All your efforts are enlisted what? Enlisted Uhhuh. and spent in the world's occupation. Uhhuh. And in the world's philosophy of occupation Uhhuh. Can that be done? Can that be done? No sir, the world cannot see the church in me. The world will not see the church in you if you come to church in that condition of things. In order for the truth to reach the world by meh who am of the church, it is essential that I shall do the work as the work of the church. do the work as so that we may not get in order for the in order for the world to reach in order for the truth to reach the world by me by me who am of the church who am of the church it is essential that I shall do the work as the work of the church the work as the work of the church if I am a farmer if you and I think Even in farming you will be told if I am a farmer I farmer of the church. Hallelujah. Amen. Farmer. Amen. Because farming and then you saying you are of the church means This is the whole of my teacher. If I'm a what? A teacher. If I'm a teacher, I am a teachers of the church. I'm a teacher of the church. A representative of the church. A representative of the church. I do my work as the work of the church. I do my work as the work of the church. Therefore, therefore this calls that every one of us who profess to belong to the church shall so really belong to the church that everything in our lives everything in our lives in our actions in our actions everything that comes in the course of our lives shall be distinctly of the church was that how pioneers were pioneers among working in the world he was a lecturer and also a pioneer Okay. It reads, \"Huh, therefore, therefore, this cause that everyone of us who profess to belong to the church shall so really belong to the church that everything in our lives in our actions, everything that comes in the course of our lives shall be distinctly of the church shall relate to the church and we will hold it up the glory of God as of the church.\" this the last one. Then then that church will be so filled with the truth and will be so sanctified by the truth with which she is filled that the glory of God which is in that truth will shine forth. The world will see her that glorious church which will be discussed everywhere by the world. That church that everything is for the church. You teach us the church. The glory of the Lord shall be seen upon thee. The word will be fulfilled that she shall rise and shine for her light is come and the glory of the Lord and the Lord is risen upon her. You know that is so now all these only to have said in other words that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall begin to sound. The myster of God shall be fulfilled as he and declare to his son the prophets. That mystery of God finished is the gospel preached to all the world that the end may come. That ministry of God is finished in the world is the work of God finished in preaching the gospel to the nation. And it is more than that. Along with that, the mystery of God is God manifest in the flesh. The finished mystery of God is the completion the perfection of the manifestation of God in the flesh in the believers in Jesus who belong to the church. Thus there are two place occupied in the finishing of the mystery of God. One place in the world itself to which the gospel is to be preached, the other place in the lives of the believers of the truth. We might preach and proclaim in words to the ends of the earth to every soul on earth in our generation. So that face of the work will be completed will be finished. Yet if the man manifestation of God in the lives of those who preach that is not completed also we could be that thing 10,000 years and the end will never come. It is not simply yet if the manifestation of God in the lives of those who preach that is not completed also we could preach that thing 10,000 years and the end will never come. is not simply that the gospel shall be preached to all the world and fill all the world but it is that when it is done there shall be a people ready to meet at the hand without the finishing of the manifestation of God in the flesh of each believer there can be no finishing of the mystery of God that mystery finished God manifest the flesh mark it means that only God is to be seen in every act of life or believer so that in his life God is manifest only that is the finish of the mystery of God in the way that it counts and you know that if that way were open and God would take position and fill the lives of the 25,000 professed believers today it would be the easiest thing in the world to reach all the nation so that end you know the mystery of God is Christ in you the hope of glory then the finished mystery of God is the finishing of the growth the manifestation of Christ the believer So that we shall stand in this world in the image of Jesus Christ reflecting only him. That when the believers when the believers shall be seen only Christ will be seen. Everything that is said, everything that is done, every tone of voice, all that we are will only of Christ only. That is the finish of the mystery of God in truth in the way that it counts. And that is what has to come before the end can come. That is a child that presents to himself. Hallelujah. Are we far away from are we do you think we are going to make but we are we thank God we are in the line. We are going what is it? What is it? Christian studies in Christian education by EA Southerntherland. [Music] We can decide to be employed. It is our choice. The youth must decide for himself. But again, uh you have seen in your own word. By the end of the call here, we are going to make a call for those who want to be church members. By the way, Vuko, do you think we are going to make it? This is the problem. It is it is the biggest problem. So these talents which are being taught if they're not going to be of church they nothing have influence now read this loudly what's used is the preaching of the gospel today while six days out of seven paganis to get the intellect. What use is the preaching of the gospel on one week? One one day of the week while six days out of the seven paganism guys the intellect. That is why the school calls that those who are in the pagan system of education if they worship it is form of what? Godliness. I hope you used to do it best in West of God. That is why many people have gotten lost today. They were so powerful in church unless God help us. By the way, without the help of God, nobody can be found. But God is trying so much the preaching of the gospel one day of the week. One day of the week Sabbath while six days out of the seven paganism guides the intellect. Why sit dreaming of heaven or spend Why is it doing what? Dreaming of heavenh or spend money to procelite. Money to process. Money to process means money to do what? To preach. So question why of what uses the preaching of the gospel on one day of the week while six days out of seven paganism guys the intellect. Huh? Why is he dreaming of heaven or spend money to proite while pagan education leads your own children by the hand? Even your children again. Uh-huh. Weaves about their mind and network of theories which blinds their eyes to spiritual truths or students wake up to study how many dogs how many teeth does a dog have many dogs. There's wait in the word of the pres president Hara of Chicago University who say it is difficult to prophesy what the result of our present method education the youth will be in 50 years. We are training the mind in our public school but the moral side of the child's nature is almost entirely neglected. The Roman Catholic cons insist on remedying the this manifest evil. But our Protestant churches seems to ignore it completely. They expect the Sunday school to make good oral public school live and done and the consequence is that we will look at danger as real as great as any we had to face. Imagine that is what are you need to teach? Why you in discipline is this one of use and then you read school teachers next time. I think if a parent has refused getting this, there's no need of bringing those children to come and destroy people's children who are struggling. Hallelujah. When may God help us. I don't want to talk much these things. I I don't want to rob them their power in Jesus name. Amen. Let's digest it. We s over these things. Do you know one of the signs of the last days when Christ was about to go to heaven, he used to tell his disciples that I will be arrested, persecuted and on the third day and they were sad and after the sec few hours they were fighting for who is greatest. So one of the says that one of the we need to study closely the life of Jesus especially in the last week is final scene. Final scene is that the things will be taught to the people of God and then after 3 days and then next time and then the following that is sign of the last days something for few minutes and no action. Please God has given this ministry powerful message and those who would want to go to heaven will have to separate. Let me tell you the pioneers did a great work. Some were teachers, some were medical missionaries. They ate and they were working all their money that the money they were getting was for the work of God and their families did not sleep hungry. Today we don't believe in that. in churches some like in Nairobi and other places is they taught that oh Daniel the same word of Daniel it is being used by the GC the pray for us there's a announcement in our people want to be taken managers so manag don't dream of heaven that is those are not my words to sum Amen. Even if all even if we are going to get lost but the name of God is glorified. Amen. That is called he tells he was praying when we were starting young evangelist. You remember that old one who came said even if I get lost let the name of God be what? glorified that grace of God was sufficient to me and I rejected. So, Amen. Don't dream of heaven. I wish no heaven in Jesus name. Other questions tomorrow in Jesus name or any time the committee will decide to put questions and answer. Was the question good? Is there somebody who has made a step? May God help us in Jesus. Who from those questions? Who has a special prayer for God's grace? Who has got you have realized you are not a church member and you want God to help you to be a church member, come forward. This is you know you are those are calls that people can come come for marvelous mar 109 as people stand up 109 welcome 109 here schools have greatest influence",
        "timestamped_transcript": "[13.7s] prophecy speaker says we will start with\n[17.0s] them in the next lesson. So this is the\n[20.0s] next lesson.\n[24.3s] Soon\n[27.2s] come I'm forgetting your name. You see\n[29.8s] I'm\n[30.6s] wondering but you'll be telling us your\n[32.9s] name first and then you ask how many do\n[36.0s] you\n[36.7s] welcome? Yes. Would you give him a mic\n[39.2s] of\n[53.5s] Yes, it's working.\n[60.6s] Good evening.\n[62.7s] My name is Baraka and I'm glad to be\n[66.2s] here. So, I'm much can say\n[71.1s] confused or uh what term can I use? Yes.\n[76.3s] But allow me read the book of John\n[77.8s] chapter 17 verse\n[81.6s] uh verse 15 before I ask my\n[84.6s] question. This Jesus praying I pray that\n[87.2s] thou should shouldest take them out of\n[90.3s] the world but that thou should keep them\n[94.2s] from the evil.\n[98.2s] So uh my question goes to uh the handle\n[103.2s] topic in the afternoon true\n[105.3s] education. All of us here I believe you\n[107.8s] are schooled and uh if not I don't know\n[111.8s] but for me\n[113.2s] personally I've uh finished campus 844\n[117.9s] system and currently I'm looking for an\n[120.7s] employment and uh in the\n[123.5s] presentations I heard\n[125.6s] that anyone working or schooling in\n[129.4s] Babylonian\n[130.8s] institution in the last days in which we\n[133.3s] are right now will\n[136.8s] uh all or parents taking their children\n[139.9s] to Babylonian schools or institutions\n[143.0s] will receive the mark of the beast. So\n[145.6s] I'm\n[147.8s] asking and this is a very serious\n[150.1s] question. The book of Daniel chapter one\n[152.2s] we see Daniel and his brothers taken to\n[155.7s] Babylon. Nemiah working as a cup\n[158.4s] bearer in uh in the king's palace. Yes,\n[162.6s] he was. Daniel and his brothers were in\n[165.1s] Babylonian king kingdom and they were\n[167.7s] working in the palace and yet they were\n[170.4s] faithful. We see Nemiah\n[173.2s] too working as a cup bearer in the\n[176.8s] king's palace.\n[178.7s] So I was asking\n[180.8s] myself as a saved member\n[185.8s] uh is it wrong to be\n[190.1s] employed for example I'm I'm a an\n[193.0s] accountant and a finance\n[195.6s] analyst if I'm employed in an\n[197.8s] institution\n[201.4s] uh in fact we were told that Babylon and\n[205.9s] the Rome as has taken over almost every\n[210.5s] institution sor even the government\n[213.4s] itself. See if I'm employed in any\n[216.5s] government institution or\n[217.4s] non-governmental institution. Is it\n[219.4s] wrong? That my first question. The\n[221.5s] second question uh in this room I know\n[225.1s] the PA system, the laptops, our phones,\n[227.4s] our dress codes, our everything are made\n[231.0s] from these\n[233.0s] institutions. the system, our phones and\n[236.2s] everything are made from all\n[238.1s] this.\n[240.7s] So I'm I'm a little bit confused. So I\n[244.6s] need much\n[245.7s] clarification that if indeed uh we are\n[249.7s] to reform in true education, what line a\n[253.4s] clear line will will we take or will I\n[256.3s] take personally? because maybe I've not\n[258.8s] learned much from other lessons but that\n[261.0s] was my first\n[262.1s] lesson\n[263.7s] and lastly if I get children if I'm\n[267.4s] married I'm not married if I be married\n[270.2s] my\n[272.4s] children what\n[274.2s] form like when the the seven adventist\n[277.8s] church began in in in 1863 there were\n[281.4s] institutions there were sanitariums\n[283.1s] there were\n[284.0s] schools in these last days one true god\n[287.0s] Do we have institutions? Do we have\n[288.4s] sanitariums? Because if I have a wife,\n[290.6s] my wife wants to be want to deliver.\n[292.7s] Will I not take her to a Babylonian\n[295.8s] oipital or any well will I take her my\n[299.8s] children all that when they are sick?\n[302.1s] Not let let me not speak of health\n[304.7s] reform but let let me speak of other\n[307.9s] institutions. So even the IT men here\n[312.1s] all of us we learn these skills there.\n[315.3s] Even Daniel and the brothers, they learn\n[317.8s] those skills. They Moses being trained\n[319.3s] in the king's palace. So that's my\n[322.2s] question.\n[324.0s] Thank you.\n[328.6s] Thank\n[333.0s] you.\n[335.7s] Answers the Bible three stories are\n[341.2s] spiritual. How many answers? 1\n[348.8s] 2 3 I ask you be short. Yes. To the\n[361.9s] point.\n[364.8s] Happy happy\n[367.1s] Sunday. Happy\n[369.2s] Sunday. Uh thank you. Uh I want to be\n[373.5s] short and precise but I want to say this\n[377.4s] as I\n[378.5s] begin. Let the Bible speak. Uh he has\n[382.2s] given a case study of\n[384.4s] Nemiah.\n[386.3s] Daniel that is where I want us to begin\n[390.1s] from. Uh if you go to the book of\n[393.3s] Daniel, let's begin from the book of\n[394.9s] Daniel chapter 1 so that we get the\n[397.3s] answer of his question first. Daniel\n[400.6s] chapter\n[401.5s] 1 we are beginning from verse number\n[406.1s] one. Daniel chapter 1 and the verses\n[409.4s] one. The scripture reads in the third\n[412.9s] year of the reign of Joakim the king of\n[415.7s] Judah came the king of Babylon and\n[418.5s] Jerusalem and besieged it. The Lord gave\n[422.0s] Joim the king of Judah into his hands\n[424.2s] with part of the vessels of the house of\n[426.0s] God which he had carried into the land\n[428.0s] of Shina the house of his God. And he\n[431.4s] brought the vessels into the treasure\n[433.5s] house of his God. And the king spake\n[436.2s] unto Ashpenas the master of the Unix\n[439.7s] that he should bring certain of the\n[441.6s] children of Israel and of the king's sin\n[444.8s] and of the\n[446.8s] princes. Go to verse four. Read with me\n[450.1s] and you understand the\n[451.6s] Bible. Children in\n[453.9s] whom was no blemish. But\n[457.7s] Lord, skillful in all wisdom and turning\n[461.8s] in\n[463.2s] knowledge, understanding, science and\n[466.6s] such had the ability in them to stand in\n[469.3s] the king's palace and whom they might\n[471.5s] teach the learning and the tongues of\n[473.5s] the childins.\n[475.4s] So from that point we get the\n[477.8s] requirement of\n[480.1s] Nebuchadzza to Ashenaz concerning the\n[483.8s] unex\n[485.1s] whom he was to bring. So the question\n[488.9s] comes what was they to learn in Babylon?\n[492.9s] They were to\n[494.4s] learn the language of the child\n[497.9s] beans because these people already they\n[501.0s] had one understanding of\n[506.3s] wisdom turning in all\n[509.6s] knowledge and understanding\n[512.8s] science and such had the ability in them\n[515.4s] to stand in the king's palace.\n[519.8s] So they had that you read the book who\n[521.8s] was the place a book called place in\n[523.6s] Bible\n[524.7s] education. Do you have it there? I want\n[528.1s] I want a hard copy. I only mark in the\n[531.0s] hard copy. If you go to the book place\n[533.8s] of Bible\n[536.5s] education in education bring me the hard\n[538.9s] copy. I want to read something on that\n[541.6s] written by Adono Trevia Jones. It will\n[544.8s] tell you that these people had the\n[547.0s] understanding from where? Get me the\n[549.8s] book parts and prophets pay 2\n[553.2s] 596. Yeah, that's what I want. Help me\n[555.8s] with\n[558.4s] it. You come and buy this book. He's\n[561.0s] only 600 shillings. I want us to read\n[563.4s] the book place of Bible education. Get\n[565.1s] me the book parts and prophet page\n[567.9s] 596. Education of Daniel. Uhhuh.\n[571.6s] So I want you to read\n[573.8s] this. Go to\n[576.4s] chapter 8 of the place of Bible\n[580.0s] education. Please go with me very fast.\n[583.5s] That chapter 8 it should be page 67 in\n[586.4s] this book 596. You read\n[590.5s] lesson before I read this I want to give\n[593.1s] the Bible principle alone. So these\n[595.4s] people were accounting in everything\n[596.7s] that they required. Okay, let's move to\n[599.4s] chapter 2 of Daniel\n[602.7s] uh chapter one sorry. So after that\n[605.4s] there was a test that this were to pass\n[608.6s] and that test Daniel and the\n[612.7s] fellow said don't give us the food from\n[617.0s] the king's me king's table but give us\n[619.8s] water and you know the things okay so I\n[623.1s] want you to prove this verse\n[626.4s] 12 prove thy servant I beseech thee 10\n[629.2s] days and let them give us pulses to eat\n[632.6s] and water to\n[635.1s] Then let our countenance be looked upon\n[637.4s] before thee, and countenance of the\n[639.7s] children that eat of the portion of the\n[641.4s] king's meat, as thou seeest, deal with\n[644.5s] thy servants. So he consented with them\n[647.1s] in this matter, and prove them 10\n[650.6s] days. Verse 15 is very critical. At the\n[654.2s] end and at the end of the 10 days the\n[658.1s] accountants what you can\n[661.2s] look appeared fairer and fatter in flesh\n[665.0s] than all the children which did eat the\n[667.2s] portion of the king's meat. One thus\n[670.7s] took away the portion of their meat and\n[672.3s] the one that they should drink and gave\n[674.0s] them passes.\n[676.4s] As for these four children, God gave\n[679.1s] them one knowledge, two skills in\n[684.1s] learning and wisdom. And Daniel had\n[686.4s] understanding in all vision and dream.\n[689.6s] Verse 18. Now at the end of the days\n[692.8s] that the king had said he should bring\n[695.2s] them in, the princes the unic brought\n[697.5s] them in before Nebuchadnezzar and the\n[699.8s] king communed with them. And among them\n[701.8s] all was found none like Daniel, Naniah,\n[705.0s] Michelle and Nazar. Therefore today they\n[706.9s] before the king. Verse 20. And in all\n[711.4s] matters all matters is it left\n[716.0s] out? Is it left out? Is farming left\n[719.8s] out? What about globe making and dress\n[724.0s] cutting? What about electrical\n[726.4s] engineering? Call it. What about flying\n[730.0s] aircraft? What is left out in\n[733.1s] all? Y all is like I'm\n[736.4s] reading God has the ability to cleanse\n[738.7s] us from all\n[740.1s] unrighteousness. So it says and in all\n[743.9s] matters of what is called wisdom and\n[747.8s] knowledge and understanding the king\n[750.8s] inquired that the king inquired of them.\n[753.9s] He found them 10 times better than all\n[757.9s] one magicians.\n[761.0s] Two,\n[763.9s] three, everyone. So I'm asking this\n[766.3s] question to you. I'm posing a bit.\n[769.0s] Listen to my\n[770.4s] question. Whom do you think were the\n[773.4s] lecturers in Babylon at this\n[777.6s] time? I'm reversing the my question\n[780.0s] again. Whom do you think were the\n[781.6s] lecturers or the teachers in Babylon at\n[784.6s] this time teaching and lecturing Daniel,\n[787.5s] Azariah and\n[789.3s] Michelle? See the same magicians and\n[792.8s] astronomers. Okay, that is when you go\n[795.8s] to Daniel chapter 2, you get that they\n[798.2s] do not understand why the wisdom of the\n[802.0s] world is foolishness with\n[805.2s] God. God is good.\n[809.1s] Which knowledge do you think you can be\n[811.4s] 10 times wiser than your\n[816.0s] lecturer?\n[818.1s] Yes. Which knowledge do you think you\n[820.6s] can be 10 times wiser than your parents\n[823.1s] who are still in\n[825.7s] Babylon? So where do you think they got\n[828.9s] this knowledge? Where I want to give you\n[832.5s] where they got the knowledge.\n[837.0s] More with me. If you have the book less\n[839.6s] of Bible\n[842.1s] education, I want you listen to what I\n[845.0s] read. Page\n[846.3s] 68. Now blemish and wellpowered. This\n[849.0s] will require that they should be\n[850.4s] physically sound, wellbe and\n[853.4s] symmetrical.\n[855.9s] The world trans wisdom, knowledge and\n[858.0s] science is vers Hebrew is death, murder,\n[861.5s] pogma and are cruc the second is\n[864.3s] extension of the first, the third and\n[866.3s] the second. So\n[868.8s] listen. Therefore the requirement of\n[871.0s] kingzar in selecting of this youth was\n[873.9s] that they should be physically sound. Is\n[876.3s] that right? symmetrical belt and that\n[880.0s] mentally they should be one skillful in\n[883.3s] deciding what is called valuable\n[885.0s] knowledge. Do you know what's called\n[886.8s] valuable\n[888.3s] knowledge? Do you know what's called\n[890.0s] valuable\n[892.1s] knowledge? Huh? The valuable knowledge\n[895.0s] is this. You have the ability to discern\n[898.7s] when to plant. Is that a knowledge that\n[900.8s] is\n[901.9s] valuable which adds value? Uhhuh.\n[905.5s] skillful ability to acquire such\n[907.0s] knowledge turning in the acquisition of\n[909.0s] knowledge by thinking and\n[911.4s] application. You get this point. You\n[914.0s] know many people go to school they think\n[916.5s] but where to apply is the problem. And I\n[919.8s] ask you this\n[921.1s] question where do you apply Pythagoras\n[923.6s] theorem in the real world? Who has been\n[926.0s] told where to apply Pythagoras theorem\n[927.5s] in the real world?\n[931.0s] Yes. Who knows where to apply Pythagoras\n[933.5s] theorem in the real world?\n[939.4s] So this is what these people had the\n[941.1s] ability to discern and acquire that\n[943.0s] knowledge and where to apply it.\n[945.8s] Understanding how to correlate,\n[948.8s] classify, systemize the knowledge which\n[951.4s] they had faculty discern was valuable\n[954.8s] knowledge and which they were cunning in\n[957.5s] gathering. So let me take you where they\n[959.6s] acquired that knowledge. Go to the book\n[961.4s] of 1 Samuel. I'm telling them where they\n[963.6s] acquire the knowledge as to stand up.\n[965.3s] 1st Samuel\n[967.5s] 19:20. Read with me. 1st Samuel\n[975.2s] 19:20. And also 2 Kings 6 1-6. I'm\n[978.3s] reading that. Then we\n[980.0s] just\n[982.3s] finish. Yes. Yeah.\n[987.3s] And Saul sent\n[988.6s] messengers to take\n[992.8s] David. And when they saw the company of\n[995.6s] the prophets\n[999.8s] Uh-huh.\n[1002.7s] Uh-huh. So then we just stop there. So\n[1005.8s] it's this there was the schools of the\n[1008.6s] prophets before these children of Israel\n[1011.4s] were c were taken captive. So this all\n[1015.6s] knowledge that was revealed in the\n[1019.5s] Babylonian as a country by then was\n[1022.7s] acquired in the schools of the prophets.\n[1025.2s] Two, these men were living under the\n[1029.4s] guidance of their\n[1032.9s] parents. Okay? So their parents were\n[1036.8s] building a character within heaven. So\n[1040.1s] there's a part of a parent to play in\n[1042.5s] character building. Read me that PP\n[1046.8s] 596. PP 596. We are I'm done with my\n[1051.1s] answer. PP\n[1052.9s] 596. Just start from paragraph one.\n[1057.8s] Uh-huh. Mhm.\n[1064.4s] Mhm. The great life work of life is\n[1067.1s] character\n[1070.1s] building. In the knowledge of God is the\n[1072.4s] foundation of all true\n[1074.5s] education to impart this\n[1078.1s] knowledge and to know the character in\n[1080.9s] the knowledge with\n[1083.2s] heat. So the object of teachers work is\n[1086.2s] that.\n[1090.5s] Uhhuh.\n[1092.4s] Uhhuh.\n[1094.7s] Yeah.\n[1099.1s] Mhm. Yeah.\n[1105.3s] Yeah.\n[1108.4s] Mhm. Go to go to page\n[1112.8s] 595. Uhhuh. Yes. 59. Let me read. It\n[1117.2s] says\n[1119.1s] uh le in the in the days of 593\n[1121.4s] paragraph 2. In some days there were two\n[1124.0s] schools. One at Rama the home of the\n[1126.6s] prophets another at Jerim where the ark\n[1129.4s] then was others were established in\n[1131.8s] their times. The people of this school\n[1133.8s] sustain themselves by their own labor in\n[1136.2s] tilling the land. So one we need to\n[1138.2s] study what is called ABC education\n[1140.6s] tilling the land or in some mechanical\n[1143.4s] employment. Uhhuh. In Israel it was\n[1147.0s] thought strange or degrading. Indeed, it\n[1150.2s] was regarded as a crime to allow\n[1151.8s] children to grow up in ignorance of\n[1154.1s] useful labor. By the command of God,\n[1156.6s] every child was storm some trade. Uhhuh.\n[1160.0s] Even though he was to be educated for\n[1161.7s] holy office. So the main object of\n[1164.7s] education in Israel was for what?\n[1167.7s] Redemption. And holy office was to\n[1169.8s] preserve for them. But as far as that,\n[1172.0s] they were also to do what is called\n[1174.2s] mechanical work, toiling the land. Last\n[1177.2s] many of the religious teachers supported\n[1178.7s] themselves by manual labor even so late\n[1182.0s] as the time of the apostle Paul and\n[1184.1s] Achil Aquilia no less honored because\n[1187.1s] they earn lively by their trade of dent\n[1189.9s] making. So that is it. Okay. Welcome.\n[1204.9s] The next person who is\n[1207.3s] coming just to\n[1210.2s] be\n[1213.9s] shorting myself in the\n[1219.8s] Are you coming to preach or\n[1223.2s] I want us to be very short because if I\n[1225.7s] want to ask questions and you take 20\n[1228.4s] minutes\n[1230.9s] please. So I will be doing something\n[1233.4s] there.\n[1235.8s] something as soon too many. You just say\n[1239.3s] this, this\n[1242.0s] this maybe tomorrow.\n[1252.3s] Praise God.\n[1254.2s] Uh I'm going to\n[1255.8s] answer I think one question that uh\n[1259.8s] should I be employed by the government\n[1262.8s] if I believe the\n[1265.6s] truth\n[1268.3s] may okay let us go to the book of\n[1271.0s] proverbs chapter 22.\n[1274.0s] The main reason why people are being\n[1275.6s] employed number one people want to live\n[1279.1s] a good life, riches, wealth and hope and\n[1283.4s] honor in the\n[1284.9s] society. 22 of Proverbs read verse 4. It\n[1290.8s] says by\n[1296.4s] and so those three things that that\n[1299.8s] matter so much in the life of any person\n[1302.1s] living they are being got\n[1304.1s] by to the fear of the lord and the fear\n[1308.6s] of the lord is the beginning of\n[1310.8s] knowledge now I want to answer the\n[1314.0s] second one should I train it we talk\n[1318.0s] about we have children where should we\n[1319.9s] take them to learn something like that.\n[1322.2s] Yeah.\n[1324.6s] Yes.\n[1326.4s] Yes. Yeah. That one I'm going to take\n[1328.7s] you to the book of the same same book.\n[1331.1s] Proverbs 22 verse number six. It says\n[1336.0s] train up where you should go.\n[1340.0s] Uhhuh. So train up a child. uh I don't\n[1343.2s] know if this instruction was given to\n[1345.4s] the teachers in the school but I think\n[1347.5s] the same as parents and uh that includes\n[1351.4s] fathers and and mothers you brought a\n[1354.8s] study of\n[1355.9s] um a study of uh about\n[1360.2s] uh Daniel and the the three Hebrew\n[1364.2s] brothers I think I remaining with one\n[1367.1s] minute I I will just give you a book\n[1370.2s] there's a book known has story of Daniel\n[1373.1s] the prophet. There is a a\n[1376.4s] chapter or written a true education and\n[1380.2s] uh I will not read everything. I will\n[1381.9s] explain for you so you go and read uh\n[1385.7s] after the announcement by prophet Isaiah\n[1389.6s] that the Babylonians will be be coming\n[1392.0s] to this city to destroy it and to take\n[1394.8s] some of the vessels of God to their\n[1396.9s] land. Mothers and the parents who are\n[1400.6s] whoard about this started teaching their\n[1404.0s] kids the sin the history of Israel were\n[1408.1s] studied and the story of Nadab and Abihu\n[1412.2s] was told and retold. They were being\n[1414.8s] taught through songs and also they were\n[1417.8s] being also taught about the effect of\n[1420.4s] health uh bad health in the family like\n[1423.4s] the effect of strong dream was impressed\n[1425.9s] upon the mind. the laws of his own being\n[1429.4s] was studied. He knew that excess in\n[1432.2s] eating and drinking will s the mind that\n[1435.0s] the voice of God could not be heard. Um\n[1438.8s] I'm I'm still looking a text that will\n[1441.3s] tell me that Daniel was was employed in\n[1445.2s] Babylon. I think it was a forced labor.\n[1448.8s] Was there that Daniel was employed and\n[1450.6s] was receiving a certain amount of money\n[1452.9s] every month? I think is there it was\n[1456.2s] employed but receiving amount of money\n[1458.4s] building even houses even ordering some\n[1461.4s] cars from abroad so I'm still looking\n[1464.0s] for that verse if there is then Daniel\n[1467.3s] was employed in Babylon and receiving\n[1471.9s] yes teacher of education\n[1477.4s] come will be all of you cannot answer\n[1481.0s] this questions amen\n[1483.8s] You can only ask another one. I'm going\n[1487.0s] to be very brief. The first verse that\n[1489.3s] was read is John 17:15 that says that\n[1493.7s] keep them from evils of the what? The\n[1496.3s] world is is what it that they in the\n[1499.4s] world but need they need to be kept from\n[1501.1s] the evils of the what? It says\n[1505.1s] out of the world. Out of the\n[1507.0s] world. The first principle to keep\n[1509.9s] somebody out of the evil is to separate\n[1511.8s] him from the the world. Number two,\n[1514.6s] there's a question that has been asked\n[1516.4s] about\n[1517.5s] Daniel commented on it. I want just read\n[1519.8s] a quotation on where Daniel obtained his\n[1521.6s] education. So that when we are talking\n[1523.3s] about number one need to know that those\n[1526.2s] people where they education I'm reading\n[1529.1s] place of the Bible in education page 80\n[1531.5s] paragraph one very fast says that the\n[1533.8s] specification distinctly made in the\n[1536.7s] scriptures so it should be projected\n[1539.3s] place of Bible in education page 80\n[1541.5s] paragraph one very fast it\n[1545.3s] reads\n[1548.1s] Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Mhm.\n[1553.6s] Mhm. Uh-huh.\n[1557.5s] Mhm. It is not small tribute to the\n[1560.4s] educational\n[1562.0s] ideas.\n[1563.6s] Indeed, this view of education as the\n[1566.6s] Bible as shown in the verse of the Bible\n[1569.4s] were for all practical what purposes\n[1572.8s] advance of the educ system fine and\n[1576.3s] advanc educational system. By the way,\n[1579.7s] what required from those people was\n[1582.6s] advanced education that the one that\n[1584.5s] exists today. Read the next statement.\n[1588.6s] Even the leading college and\n[1590.2s] universities of the United States. So\n[1593.2s] what was even higher than the education\n[1596.8s] that was providing the universities and\n[1598.7s] colleges of United what states? Yet yet\n[1602.3s] Daniel\n[1604.6s] Daniel\n[1606.4s] and successfully were able successfully\n[1609.8s] such to pass such an examination where\n[1612.4s] then they said such education that\n[1614.5s] exceeded even the education that was\n[1616.3s] provided in the university.\n[1619.4s] Uhhuh. But you the answer to this\n[1622.0s] question the answer to this question is\n[1625.4s] having worth having. Besides, besides we\n[1627.7s] need it just now. All this was done for\n[1630.9s] last days. Next paragraph. Daniel, where\n[1634.0s] did Daniel? You see people says that\n[1636.8s] Daniel were taken to what?\n[1639.7s] Babylon. Get this. Get this. Where then?\n[1644.2s] Daniel and his three\n[1646.8s] companions. The educational enabled them\n[1650.6s] successfully to\n[1654.8s] pass them skillful in all wisdom and\n[1658.6s] cunning in knowledge and science\n[1661.8s] all these things withoutation\n[1665.4s] it can be answered in a school in the\n[1667.8s] schools of what? So during the times of\n[1670.3s] prophets there was a what? A school.\n[1672.2s] Read the divinely established school.\n[1674.4s] The divinely established school in what?\n[1677.4s] So in Israel there was a school\n[1679.6s] established. Continue reading. There was\n[1681.7s] at that time there was that that time\n[1685.2s] what school of the what? In Jerusalem.\n[1688.8s] In Jerusalem in the year of king of\n[1691.9s] Judah.\n[1694.2s] So we need to understand that the the\n[1696.3s] likes of Daniel I could have read many\n[1698.1s] things but the Daniel obtained an\n[1700.1s] education in the university on Israel.\n[1702.7s] Okay. Number two. Number two. 1 28\n[1707.0s] paragraph 2 says that God's purpose in\n[1709.0s] giving the third angel's message. God's\n[1710.9s] purpose in giving the angels message to\n[1713.8s] the world to prepare people to stand\n[1715.9s] true to him during the investigative\n[1718.1s] what? Judgment. This is the purpose for\n[1720.7s] which we establish and maintain our\n[1722.3s] publishing houses. Our what? Our\n[1725.7s] schools, our sanitariums, hygienic\n[1728.4s] restaurants, treatment what? treatment\n[1730.5s] rooms and factories factories. This is\n[1733.8s] our purpose in carrying forward the work\n[1736.7s] in every word every life. Okay. So God's\n[1739.7s] purpose to carry the message is that we\n[1742.0s] have our own our own school. Hallelujah.\n[1745.0s] The last thing I'm saying is that not\n[1747.9s] all the knowledge that is in the world\n[1750.8s] is unnecessary. Are we together? What\n[1753.7s] Satan is doing is mingling truth and\n[1757.6s] air. You go to place of Bible education,\n[1759.7s] you realize that even in our schools\n[1761.8s] where we have to maintain this in our\n[1763.7s] schools there are things that we have to\n[1765.7s] teach. One of them language must be\n[1767.8s] taught, geography must be taught, must\n[1770.6s] be\n[1771.7s] taught anatomy and\n[1774.0s] physiology must be music must be done\n[1776.5s] what must be taught. Amen. And therefore\n[1778.6s] when the Lord has brought a knowledge\n[1780.7s] that will help in carrying on the\n[1783.1s] gospel, that knowledge will be accepted\n[1785.8s] by God's people, God's people. So long\n[1787.7s] as that knowledge will\n[1789.9s] not confuse them the mind and lead to\n[1792.9s] what to say. Amen. Others will be\n[1795.4s] handled in the next lessons in Jesus\n[1797.0s] name.\n[1804.5s] You want to answer or you want to ask a\n[1808.1s] question? Question is\n[1814.3s] coming. Yes.\n[1816.8s] this many\n[1818.5s] hands. Put your hands\n[1822.6s] down like you ask the\n[1827.1s] question still being answered.\n[1833.3s] Yes. The context for my question. The\n[1836.7s] context for my question was is it wrong\n[1838.9s] to be to study or to be employed in that\n[1844.1s] institution? Not the not the what being\n[1848.1s] taught is wrong because I think the\n[1851.9s] there should be a simultaneous\n[1853.3s] application whereby parents can teach\n[1856.0s] the way Daniel and the others were\n[1858.1s] taught and then that the knowledge from\n[1861.0s] home will help them to survive in those\n[1864.8s] so my questioning\n[1871.5s] me and I go and work there is it just to\n[1875.1s] go and work\n[1876.9s] or is it wrong\n[1878.7s] just\n[1881.2s] leaving it wrong?\n[1887.0s] So that means those who be answering the\n[1889.7s] questions, you don't even note them\n[1891.8s] down. You love answering, you don't\n[1894.0s] note.\n[1896.2s] Yes. Amen. So note the questions so that\n[1900.2s] you may not come and don't\n[1904.0s] answer. Now who want to answer that? If\n[1907.6s] you have noted so that you may not come\n[1909.4s] and start out a study till the somebody\n[1912.4s] who ask a question is wondering am I\n[1914.8s] being answered? Yes, but at least you\n[1918.3s] have gotten that Daniel did not go to\n[1920.6s] Babylon to study. In fact, Daniel\n[1923.9s] chapter one is written that he had all\n[1926.8s] knowledge and wisdom. By the way, they\n[1928.9s] had everything while with us we are\n[1930.6s] going to school to acquire those\n[1932.0s] knowledge. But they all all knowledge,\n[1934.8s] wisdom, full of science all things and\n[1938.2s] in fact it is written that the knowledge\n[1941.2s] wanted cannot even be found in\n[1943.5s] University of United States. So that\n[1947.0s] means those people went there when\n[1948.5s] already they prepared. The question was\n[1950.2s] where did they get the education they\n[1952.8s] got it from the what back at their home?\n[1956.3s] Somebody came here who read that they\n[1958.0s] were taught even health at home. Even\n[1959.7s] their standing with health message in\n[1962.2s] Daniel in Babylon was not an accident.\n[1965.4s] It was not what an is the first\n[1968.2s] principle. Even when you are going to be\n[1969.8s] answered going to work there. Number\n[1972.4s] two, it was also a command of God that\n[1975.9s] let them go to Babylon. Remember God\n[1978.6s] told Jeremiah said that those who will\n[1980.5s] refuse will be killed. But again our\n[1982.8s] command now is not to go to Babylon. It\n[1984.7s] is to come out of Babylon. Our command\n[1987.5s] is different. Their command was to go\n[1989.1s] bon all of you that y is coming put your\n[1992.5s] y ours is to come out of so we have to\n[1996.7s] look line upon line the other line and\n[1999.0s] this line and connect somebody to come\n[2000.9s] and ask yes yes felix come and then we\n[2005.0s] are you will the rest will answer the\n[2006.9s] next questions is still the same\n[2010.1s] so thank\n[2012.5s] you 2 minutes 2 minutes yes\n[2017.1s] go is\n[2018.8s] I want to read one verse. 1 Corinthians\n[2021.1s] 6:17 I think says that\n[2024.9s] 6:17\n[2026.4s] verse from verse 14 very fast\n[2029.4s] the Bible reads the praise of the Lord\n[2033.1s] is it second or 2 Corinthians 6:14\n[2038.0s] the Bible reads\n[2041.3s] be not equally y together with\n[2044.6s] unbelievers both fellowship as\n[2046.9s] righteousness or unrighteousness Yes.\n[2050.9s] What is what communion as light with\n[2053.0s] darkness?\n[2056.0s] So who is unbeliever do not be collect\n[2058.5s] together with unbeliever who is\n[2062.6s] unbeliever. Who is unbeliever?\n[2067.1s] So we cannot we cannot be united with\n[2070.2s] someone in business transaction. White\n[2073.1s] says that we cannot even be united in\n[2075.3s] business transaction with those who do\n[2077.8s] not believe\n[2079.1s] what with those who do not believe the\n[2081.6s] the present. So it is\n[2083.7s] wrong. It is wrong to be employed in\n[2087.0s] such a school in in in worldly\n[2089.7s] employment because they are unbelievers.\n[2091.7s] You cannot work among them because you\n[2093.6s] have a precious truth. So I wanted to\n[2096.6s] read read the last quote education page\n[2100.6s] 77.\n[2102.7s] says that where Christ also receive his\n[2106.0s] education so we are not to be employed\n[2108.2s] by\n[2109.2s] worldly as I read that I am quoting\n[2111.9s] great controversy page 491.2 2 says that\n[2116.1s] while men will be absorbed in business\n[2118.7s] pursuit their probation will be what?\n[2121.8s] Closing. Amen. So you cannot be employed\n[2124.7s] in worldly institution if you have these\n[2129.2s] truths. Page\n[2132.8s] 77.1 I think the value of principle. No\n[2137.0s] I want to read the last last statement\n[2139.0s] says that is education directly from\n[2141.3s] heaven.\n[2144.4s] Now listen where we need to obtain\n[2146.2s] directly from heaven appointed\n[2151.0s] sources. Gain directly from appointed\n[2153.7s] sources. This education was gained\n[2155.9s] direct directly from heaven appointed\n[2158.2s] sources. From useful work. Number one\n[2161.4s] useful useful work from the study of the\n[2164.4s] scriptures. Study of the B of study of\n[2167.5s] the scriptures of nature. Nature and\n[2169.8s] from the experience of life. The\n[2171.2s] experience of what? Those are the four\n[2173.8s] syllabus. So we are not going to be\n[2176.6s] employed by the word useful work,\n[2179.0s] scriptures,\n[2181.0s] nature. Amen. I think I'm done.\n[2185.4s] So as\n[2187.0s] uh as comes the simple\n[2191.4s] answer is you can put\n[2193.5s] [Music]\n[2195.6s] here will be a direct answer to your\n[2198.0s] question.\n[2202.6s] It is very\n[2211.7s] direct. You you have to come forward.\n[2214.5s] Can we allow come forward? Just come\n[2217.4s] forward so that we maybe\n[2222.4s] maybe Yes.\n[2229.9s] Okay, good evening.\n[2233.0s] My question\n[2234.6s] is on it was yesterday that go was\n[2238.4s] teaching about\n[2239.7s] talents and he was saying that if you\n[2243.0s] abandon one bar one talent you be\n[2246.4s] responsible for\n[2247.8s] it isn't it that so I'm\n[2252.7s] asking there is an example you give that\n[2255.8s] if you have a talent of\n[2258.0s] business and the same time you are for\n[2261.1s] farming\n[2262.8s] And business if you can come to the real\n[2266.0s] world business is mostly empowered with\n[2269.2s] worldly\n[2271.1s] things.\n[2273.0s] So if I abandon those business that is\n[2277.6s] associated with worldly things and go\n[2281.4s] to farming which is not which is useful\n[2285.6s] and not worldly. So will life be\n[2289.0s] responsible for that? And the another\n[2291.7s] question is there is this practical\n[2294.5s] institutions\n[2296.0s] that we go and\n[2298.3s] learn something like maybe construction\n[2302.2s] of our own\n[2303.9s] houses. Are they bad? And if they are\n[2308.1s] bad, which way\n[2310.6s] forward? And I think the last question\n[2314.4s] is\n[2317.5s] this or these items we are using here\n[2321.0s] even cooking are made from the worldly\n[2324.2s] instructions and if we shall stop using\n[2326.8s] them and maybe return to the maybe if it\n[2329.8s] is cooking we return to ports. So I hope\n[2334.2s] from tomorrow we will be cooking using\n[2336.4s] pots not free if it is.\n[2345.2s] Thank you. Good\n[2350.0s] evening. We thank God for all these\n[2352.6s] privileges to be together to share these\n[2354.8s] messages and we hope the Lord is leading\n[2357.9s] us. One thing I believe is that the\n[2361.2s] Lord wants us to be balanced in\n[2364.0s] everything and to follow the voice of\n[2366.4s] truth and make decisions. Amen.\n[2369.6s] So I know the questions that the brother\n[2372.2s] ask us the last questions\n[2375.2s] uh let me begin with the other one first\n[2378.6s] though brother Maxwell has promised that\n[2380.3s] he will blow something there which will\n[2382.6s] solve everything uh on the question but\n[2385.7s] let me give my\n[2387.5s] view as a people as we stand\n[2390.7s] today as the teacher for true education\n[2393.4s] has said we have lost our birthight you\n[2397.4s] know we sold it\n[2400.4s] Um those people who followed our\n[2402.7s] pioneers they sold us away. They never\n[2406.0s] maintained our schools. We had Lalinda,\n[2408.3s] we had Madison school, we had Battle\n[2410.5s] Creek Colleges. These places were\n[2412.7s] superior. If you study the history of\n[2416.1s] the great depression, economic\n[2418.6s] depression in\n[2421.2s] 1929, when the secretary of education of\n[2424.9s] the United States of America visited\n[2427.6s] Madison school, he said, \"All American\n[2431.3s] schools should be ordered in this\n[2433.2s] manner.\" They were running in the best\n[2435.9s] way possible that any government school\n[2438.6s] will wish to run. We sold it away. We\n[2441.8s] lost it. What we are doing in this\n[2444.7s] generation is we are crying out for\n[2448.0s] restoration of those places. So this\n[2450.9s] voice that is crying right now is not\n[2453.8s] pointing us at a place where we have but\n[2456.2s] saying we have lost it, we want to\n[2459.1s] regain it. Amen.\n[2461.2s] So by saying those places have a problem\n[2466.1s] is a voice calling that we should go\n[2468.6s] back to something which we must do\n[2471.1s] practically not just by words. So when\n[2475.1s] we said those places are evil let me\n[2477.5s] just put it now in a few words after\n[2479.6s] saying\n[2480.9s] that my brother has already said not\n[2485.6s] everything in the world is negative. The\n[2489.3s] problem is that there is a mingling of\n[2492.3s] error and what and truth. And the Lord\n[2495.2s] wants us to establish places where we\n[2497.3s] can find truth in its purity. That's the\n[2500.4s] thing. And we want to move there slowly.\n[2503.6s] We don't want to speak as though we\n[2505.2s] already have the places. No, we are\n[2507.4s] heading to that direction. And that's\n[2509.5s] our cry as a people. So, brother, we do\n[2512.7s] not have such places. The Lord wants us\n[2514.8s] to establish such a places and we are\n[2517.2s] beginning that work first by accepting\n[2519.6s] that we have missed the point and now we\n[2521.7s] can begin from here going towards that\n[2524.0s] direction and for our children we are\n[2527.5s] making preparations so that they will\n[2529.9s] not be partakers of these places. I'm\n[2532.9s] speaking because my child is not yet of\n[2535.2s] age. For those whose children are of\n[2537.4s] age, they have already made a decision\n[2539.4s] to begin doing it. You get the point. So\n[2542.0s] and as a church we must take up this\n[2543.8s] work and lead it to the father's place.\n[2547.2s] Um one still one example suffer me\n[2551.6s] brother. Uh Hezekiah when he was visited\n[2555.0s] by the ambassadors from Babylon they\n[2558.0s] were Ezekiah was supposed to tell them\n[2560.5s] about the true God right and how he had\n[2563.8s] gotten healed. But instead he showed\n[2567.2s] him all the things that he had. And the\n[2570.0s] Lord said the days are coming when your\n[2573.1s] children even born of yourself shall be\n[2575.2s] taken to Babylon. Shall they shall be\n[2577.0s] made unax and they shall serve the king.\n[2579.8s] So Daniel and his friends never served\n[2581.9s] in Babylon because they they loved it.\n[2586.1s] No, it was not that way. God really gave\n[2588.5s] them privileges because they respected\n[2590.8s] God. So that the king of Babylon treated\n[2594.1s] them with favors. But see, they were\n[2596.2s] made unox. Do you know what that means?\n[2598.7s] They were\n[2601.2s] castrated. Think about\n[2604.6s] that. Can anyone go to school to be\n[2607.6s] castrated? No. No. No. No. I really\n[2609.8s] don't think so. They never served out of\n[2613.0s] their own willingness. And if we are\n[2616.2s] going to serve out of our own\n[2618.5s] willingness, you realize that we are\n[2620.7s] selling ourselves. So I will say\n[2623.0s] personally in this\n[2624.6s] regard I'm sorry I am just re finding it\n[2628.9s] hard to summarize this thing because I\n[2631.3s] found the question so heavy. Should I\n[2634.0s] end it there or I still say something?\n[2636.6s] Two minutes more just two more minutes.\n[2641.1s] So what I wanted to say is these things\n[2643.8s] that we are using here are not evil.\n[2647.8s] We started yesterday. We realized that\n[2650.6s] the spirit of invention that gift comes\n[2653.1s] from who? From the Lord. It may be\n[2655.7s] misaligned. But can't we if we install\n[2659.1s] this system of education, can't we be\n[2662.1s] able also to even invent such things?\n[2665.5s] I'm persuaded if the adventist never\n[2667.5s] lost that, we will be very far much\n[2670.4s] ahead of the world. We're sure we will\n[2672.0s] be the ones doing these things and not\n[2674.2s] going there to acquire that knowledge.\n[2675.7s] You get the point? higher than the\n[2677.8s] highest human thought is God's ideal is\n[2680.5s] God's ideal for his children and that's\n[2685.0s] it. Now the rest of the questions the\n[2687.8s] brother has asked I still have lessons\n[2691.0s] in my class and especially what he said\n[2695.1s] I will capture it because I will be\n[2697.0s] talking about what sections of\n[2699.7s] businesses and what sections of works we\n[2703.2s] can engage. Some of them are secular but\n[2706.3s] acceptable. You get the point. And some\n[2708.9s] are Christian in practice. I mean they\n[2710.4s] are gospel like running a publishing\n[2712.2s] place. It makes money yet it is for\n[2714.4s] gospel reasons. But if you are a mass\n[2717.7s] it's not heralding the gospel proper but\n[2720.6s] it is innocent. That one is not evil. So\n[2723.3s] I'll talk about those businesses in my\n[2726.0s] series on classes. So let me just end it\n[2728.3s] there. Thank you.\n[2730.5s] Thank you.\n[2732.1s] Thank you brother for you will be\n[2733.8s] answered even at education is not ended\n[2737.4s] brother if you come every day again this\n[2741.3s] one now this is\n[2743.5s] GCDB s your question is direct GCDB's\n[2747.9s] general conference bulletin do you\n[2749.5s] believe the spirit of prophecy\n[2752.7s] yes I believe let's read\n[2762.4s] Where should we start?\n[2772.2s] A question worth asking. If my money\n[2774.3s] belongs to the world, yes. Do I belong\n[2778.6s] to the church? Uhhuh.\n[2780.6s] If my abilities are put to the work of\n[2783.4s] the world as of the world of the church\n[2787.4s] as of the church then the Christian\n[2789.6s] consider I belong to the church myself\n[2793.0s] that our attention the Christian how\n[2795.6s] much\n[2798.3s] me how much is\n[2810.8s] And it is a question worth asking. If my\n[2813.4s] money belongs to the world, do I belong\n[2817.1s] to the church? If my talent, my\n[2819.9s] abilities are put into the work of the\n[2821.4s] world as of the world and not the work\n[2823.8s] of the church as of the church. The\n[2826.0s] question is worth considering. Do I\n[2827.8s] belong to the church myself? That turns\n[2830.4s] our attention to the question, how much\n[2832.4s] does it take to compose me? How much is\n[2835.0s] there of a man? Do you have a man here\n[2837.5s] at this faculty yonder is about in\n[2839.7s] another place and the fruit of f of his\n[2841.9s] faculty, the fruit of his abilities, the\n[2844.3s] result of his life and endeavor in yet\n[2846.7s] another place. Could that be the man be\n[2849.9s] here? All of\n[2852.1s] him. No sir. All my faculties, all the\n[2856.8s] fruits of my life must wear. If I myself\n[2860.2s] am to be there. We cannot escape that\n[2864.2s] then do I belong to the church? Do I?\n[2867.0s] That is the question. Does 75,000 uh 7th\n[2871.2s] Adventist belong to the church? 75,000\n[2874.8s] 700 belongs to the church. Do we that is\n[2879.0s] the question to illustrate. So get\n[2881.9s] illustration. Get illustration. Do all\n[2884.2s] these people who are sitting here belong\n[2885.8s] to this channel? That is the question.\n[2888.2s] So illustration now to illustrate\n[2891.7s] illustrate now listen suppose I have my\n[2893.9s] name on the church book belong to the\n[2896.1s] church I'm a school teacher and I'm\n[2898.8s] spend all my time all my endeavor all my\n[2902.5s] ability all my faculty as a school\n[2905.8s] teacher in the world school teaching and\n[2909.0s] teaching in the world school the world's\n[2911.8s] in the world's way the world's education\n[2914.4s] it is worth asking do I belong to the\n[2916.7s] church am I loving the church and giving\n[2919.5s] myself whatever I may profess my faculty\n[2923.0s] my life what am I in the ability which\n[2925.5s] god has given me I am giving it to the\n[2928.4s] world for the world's work and the\n[2930.6s] world's purpose that is so that I am\n[2933.8s] loving the church and give myself do I\n[2936.6s] belong the church suppose I am a\n[2938.9s] physician and I give my ability my\n[2941.1s] talent my faculties my life and I the\n[2944.6s] world's way of what is called medicine\n[2948.0s] the world's way of treating diseases. I\n[2950.4s] stand as a member of the church as\n[2952.6s] belong to the church. I am to be\n[2954.3s] sanctified and cleansed the washing of\n[2956.0s] water with the word of God and that word\n[2958.4s] of God that is given to the church the\n[2960.6s] divine the true system medical treatment\n[2962.8s] the true philosophy and treatment with\n[2964.7s] regard to health disease right living\n[2967.4s] and all these things. I belong to the\n[2969.6s] church to be sanctified and cleansed the\n[2971.7s] washing of water by that word. Instead\n[2974.5s] of doing what that word gives to me to\n[2978.0s] which I am committed as belonging to the\n[2980.0s] church, I take that world gives and\n[2983.1s] devote to the world. What which I get\n[2985.5s] from the world and I belong to the\n[2987.2s] church. Do I? I belong to the church for\n[2990.3s] the purpose of being sanctified.\n[2993.5s] Is that making us not to get this?\n[2998.2s] Okay. I belong to the church for the\n[3000.9s] purpose of being sanctified and cleansed\n[3003.0s] with the washing of water by the word of\n[3005.5s] God to the church. There is in that word\n[3009.0s] and that word itself is a system of\n[3012.8s] education. That is the true and the only\n[3015.8s] true education. I say I belong to the\n[3019.0s] church but I am satisfied with the\n[3020.7s] world's education with the world's\n[3022.3s] system of education with the world's\n[3024.0s] philosophy of education and I devote my\n[3026.1s] life to that I want to know do I really\n[3029.0s] belong to the church it is precisely I\n[3031.9s] think these\n[3033.8s] things would not get\n[3037.4s] this cuz they are not\n[3040.8s] consequence like that no no now repeat\n[3044.1s] this one there's in that one and Yeah,\n[3047.0s] there is that word and that word itself\n[3049.4s] is a system of education. That is the\n[3052.2s] true that is the only true education. I\n[3054.6s] say I belong to the church but I'm\n[3056.7s] satisfied with the world's education,\n[3058.4s] the world's system education, the\n[3060.0s] world's philosophy education. I devote\n[3062.1s] my life to that. I want to know do I\n[3064.9s] really belong to the church? It is\n[3066.8s] precisely so also as to medical or any\n[3070.7s] other profession. So all processions you\n[3073.2s] can have you take but somebody also to\n[3076.5s] get saying taking six days in the pagan\n[3080.1s] institution and one day then you only\n[3081.9s] have a day somebody to get that I still\n[3083.5s] continue and I am a man of other affairs\n[3086.3s] in the world whether it be business or\n[3088.8s] farming or carpenter work. I mean the\n[3091.5s] every commercial business world I stand\n[3094.7s] as belong to the church and the efforts\n[3096.6s] which I put forth of thought or endeavor\n[3099.2s] the blessings of God upon it all\n[3101.2s] increase comes I put it in the worldly\n[3103.6s] bank I'm not a speculator I belong to\n[3106.6s] the church but here is the means God has\n[3109.8s] given to me as a member of the church\n[3111.5s] and I put it into the worldly bank I\n[3114.0s] loan it to the worldly men to be used in\n[3116.1s] worldly business instead of in the work\n[3118.6s] of the church to which I belong Then it\n[3120.9s] is fair question for me to ask do I\n[3123.3s] belong to the church? This reference to\n[3126.2s] illustrate and now there's not one here\n[3129.4s] of these delegates. These delegates you\n[3131.6s] are in the\n[3132.9s] delegates the delegates. It's enough to\n[3136.4s] illustrate. And now there's not one here\n[3139.0s] of these delegates who cannot look all\n[3142.4s] over this land and see thousands upon\n[3144.5s] thousand 7th Adventist who stand in a\n[3146.7s] position as belonging to the church.\n[3149.3s] Which leaves a wide open question for\n[3151.4s] you and to ask do I belong to the\n[3153.7s] church? And everyone here knows that if\n[3156.7s] all seven adventists in the United State\n[3158.8s] from this day and forward who really\n[3160.7s] belong to the church, you yourself will\n[3163.7s] confess that there is no question at all\n[3166.2s] but that this message could be given to\n[3168.2s] the world in this generation. You can\n[3171.6s] only why this message cannot go\n[3175.6s] now to the church but we are in\n[3178.3s] church. a world person in where the\n[3181.1s] church but not a member and a you can\n[3184.5s] all say amen to\n[3186.2s] that. You know that that is so then you\n[3189.1s] see you going to say amen but you know\n[3192.4s] it is so and then you see brethren the\n[3196.6s] problem is not difficult. The problem is\n[3198.9s] not difficult. It is just this question\n[3200.7s] to be decided. It is not difficult. This\n[3204.1s] issue of education is not what it is\n[3207.6s] just this question to be what decided by\n[3210.4s] it is just to be discussed by each one\n[3213.0s] or himself. The youth must decide for\n[3215.8s] himself.\n[3217.3s] Do I belong to the church? You are going\n[3219.0s] to come out of this meeting. You can\n[3221.0s] work in the world. But again, do you and\n[3223.7s] Christ is coming to take the church.\n[3226.4s] Christ is coming to take a church.\n[3231.7s] Do I belong to the church?\n[3234.6s] Where\n[3235.7s] next? Oh now shall I not shall not I\n[3240.5s] find myself my faculties or my means\n[3243.3s] wrapped up in the work of the world used\n[3245.4s] in behalf of the world or engage the\n[3247.3s] world's work shall not I will not you\n[3251.1s] wall it away from there and put the\n[3253.9s] church's work in the course of the\n[3255.9s] church in the earth to which I belong\n[3258.8s] let that be done and you know that\n[3261.0s] spiritually it will shake this worlds\n[3263.3s] out of its place think of it if only\n[3265.9s] seventh advent in the United States\n[3267.9s] would really consider this allow the\n[3270.0s] church give themselves with their\n[3271.8s] children give their themselves with\n[3274.7s] their children do you know why our\n[3276.6s] schools are failing when they\n[3280.5s] began education where is the money of\n[3282.8s] the advent going the world even these\n[3285.5s] schools who who building who are in the\n[3287.8s] who are board members\n[3290.5s] who are the teachers there are they\n[3292.3s] members of this\n[3293.5s] church those who are teaching in the\n[3295.5s] worldly schools Do we have members in\n[3297.0s] our church here and in our school? What\n[3300.3s] if these talents were used in the\n[3302.8s] church? What if all these talents all\n[3305.7s] were used in the church now and it says\n[3309.2s] yes\n[3310.8s] let that be done and you know that\n[3313.0s] spiritually it will shake this world out\n[3314.6s] of its place. Think of it. If all seven\n[3317.8s] adventists in United States really\n[3319.8s] consider this, love the church, give\n[3322.2s] themselves with their children for the\n[3324.6s] church and to the church, how would our\n[3326.9s] schools work stand? Imagine if all of\n[3339.6s] us it will be stand where it ought and\n[3342.9s] such consecration as that will bring\n[3344.9s] such power from heaven that the teaching\n[3347.0s] will be saved will be easy. The lack of\n[3350.1s] teachers will not be such as it is now.\n[3352.6s] So now we don't even have teachers. We\n[3354.6s] even collect things that should not be\n[3357.9s] collected.\n[3363.0s] Hallelujah. You\n[3366.6s] collect those who have talent in the\n[3373.5s] world.\n[3378.8s] Hallelujah. They know how to teach best.\n[3381.7s] You would have not lacked teachers. The\n[3383.4s] language teachers will not be such a\n[3385.0s] hindist. No. And so with all the rest,\n[3388.6s] if all seven day Adventist in the land\n[3391.1s] will turn their families and Christian\n[3393.1s] education and all our families, if we\n[3395.7s] can turn our families to Christian\n[3397.4s] education and the education that becomes\n[3399.7s] the church and education that becomes\n[3401.5s] the church. And the world is calling for\n[3403.3s] the church to give. The world is calling\n[3405.5s] the church to give that education. And\n[3407.5s] because he has just said in 1929\n[3409.9s] somebody went where? to to the medicine\n[3414.4s] and see this is the what\n[3417.2s] see and now shall I not find myself and\n[3420.1s] my faculties or my mean grabs in the\n[3422.2s] work of the world use the world or\n[3424.3s] engage in the work world's work shall I\n[3426.2s] not shall not I will not you away from\n[3429.9s] there and put the child's work elites\n[3432.6s] cause of the charge in the earth to\n[3434.8s] which I belong\n[3441.4s] Somebody's joking here. He's not with\n[3443.4s] us.\n[3445.0s] Yes. Be with us. Please be church. Be\n[3448.5s] church. Amen. And so with all the rest,\n[3451.5s] if all the seven in the land will turn\n[3453.9s] their families under Christian\n[3455.0s] education, education that that becomes\n[3457.5s] the church and that the world is calling\n[3459.8s] for the church to give and for the want\n[3462.2s] of which and because of the lack of\n[3464.5s] which the world itself is saying that\n[3467.1s] the church in education is a distinctly\n[3469.3s] diminishing quantity.\n[3471.4s] If this were done, the world would\n[3473.6s] easily be rich in this generation. So\n[3476.1s] how can the world be rich in this\n[3477.6s] generation? only through what?\n[3480.7s] There's no way we can reach them. Not\n[3482.4s] through\n[3484.3s] crusades. Okay. If we do crusades and we\n[3487.2s] don't have the true education, we rather\n[3488.8s] stop preaching cuz we are forming\n[3491.4s] churches that are going to be Babylon\n[3493.0s] again. What has made the general content\n[3495.7s] to be Babylon is because of the\n[3497.1s] education of the world. Amen.\n[3501.8s] It is time that there should be one\n[3503.5s] church in the world that will rise and\n[3505.5s] be not a mission quoted in education but\n[3507.9s] be the whole thing in education. If the\n[3510.2s] seventh day Adventist will really give\n[3511.8s] themselves the church loving it giving\n[3514.2s] themsel for it with all their talents\n[3516.4s] all their means all their powers then\n[3518.6s] the whole problem will be solved. So why\n[3520.8s] do we have a problem?\n[3523.0s] There are people inside this movement\n[3524.6s] but they have refused to be the judge\n[3528.1s] members. That is why we have a problem.\n[3530.7s] Separation will come again. People want\n[3533.8s] to be united. We talk we talk of unity.\n[3537.4s] And by the way, that book says that in\n[3540.3s] 1860s the church was busy talking of\n[3542.9s] unity and organization while their\n[3544.5s] children were going to the what? World\n[3546.5s] education. That was the\n[3549.3s] problem including the daughter of the\n[3551.7s] prophet. when when he died the children\n[3555.6s] of public school came and uh Sudaland\n[3558.4s] says that was the problem. They were\n[3559.8s] busy talking of church organization.\n[3561.8s] Unity we need to come together. Unity.\n[3564.5s] What are we talking about\n[3566.0s] now? See unity and organization. But\n[3569.5s] they are saying true education was to\n[3571.8s] bring what? Unity.\n[3575.8s] Unity. So it is the same. This is the\n[3578.3s] problem we have. Some people in the\n[3580.0s] inside here but they're not church\n[3583.6s] members. They're not church members.\n[3586.6s] That is the only problem. It is the\n[3588.7s] problem is not\n[3593.9s] management. People are not church\n[3606.0s] members. Yeah. Says if the seventh\n[3609.4s] adventist will really give themselves to\n[3610.9s] the church, loving it, giving themselves\n[3613.3s] for it with all their talents, all their\n[3615.3s] means, all their powers, then the whole\n[3617.5s] problem will be solved. The world\n[3619.5s] facilities are abandoned. In brother\n[3621.8s] Daniel's discourse last night that was\n[3624.5s] presented to us all, brother Conrad\n[3627.1s] today showed how the fields are open and\n[3629.4s] all ready and the harvest. The\n[3631.9s] prophecies are in a convention like we\n[3634.0s] are. Uhhuh. The prophecies so abundant\n[3637.2s] so that abundant by the way the\n[3639.1s] prophecies we have been learning\n[3641.4s] here talking of\n[3645.6s] what see\n[3648.0s] schools I will show you the commandments\n[3650.5s] in schools now they look the so\n[3654.1s] prophecies are what prophecies so\n[3656.7s] abundant showing that now there's time\n[3658.6s] that have been\n[3660.1s] presented let these people present\n[3662.2s] ourselves to Christ today loving the\n[3664.9s] being the church, giving ourselves for\n[3666.7s] it. Giving ourselves for the church.\n[3668.8s] These people I say present ourselves to\n[3671.8s] Christ as his church to love that church\n[3674.7s] to give yourself for it and to give\n[3676.6s] yourself to it with all\n[3679.9s] our\n[3686.2s] our you are not even reading these\n[3688.5s] things with all efforts all the fruit\n[3692.5s] effort of whatsoever kind Uh-huh it will\n[3696.5s] be as sweet was before this will be a\n[3699.4s] holy church. So what will make a holy\n[3701.9s] church? When we give ourselves for the\n[3704.2s] church to the church and in the church\n[3706.5s] and for the church and to the church\n[3709.4s] this will be a holy not having a wrinkle\n[3713.6s] or any such thing. The church the pill\n[3716.2s] and the ground of I will study student\n[3717.9s] who always teach what the church is. Do\n[3719.6s] you tell them about this\n[3722.8s] education? church without a wrinkle.\n[3726.1s] See? Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Is this\n[3730.3s] church having a wrinkle and spot?\n[3732.6s] Serious. Hallelujah. The church is the\n[3735.8s] pill on the ground. And that was what in\n[3739.4s] 2021 we were in this hall and that is\n[3742.3s] where organization\n[3744.8s] started was I want my church back. Oh,\n[3748.3s] and this was the this was this was 1\n[3750.6s] Timothy 3:14 and 15. It was our look at\n[3753.7s] that church. Church is the church is the\n[3755.7s] pill on the ground. The support that the\n[3757.8s] stay of the truth in the world. The only\n[3760.3s] means for me this world can ever obtain\n[3762.2s] truth is by the church. By the church.\n[3763.9s] It may be that the church like the\n[3766.0s] church of Israel and Judah will of\n[3768.3s] itself voluntarily spread that truth\n[3770.1s] abroad to the world. The people may like\n[3772.6s] Israel and Judah shut themselves within\n[3774.8s] themselves. Shut themselves within\n[3776.4s] themselves and turn the truth of God\n[3778.5s] away. Put other things in its place.\n[3781.0s] shut themselves away from the world and\n[3782.9s] thus failed to give it to the world. But\n[3785.5s] if that must be so then that church will\n[3788.3s] be scattered. So this church is going to\n[3790.1s] be scattered again. Uhhuh. As was Israel\n[3792.6s] and as was Judah amongst the nation of\n[3795.0s] heathen and they in oppression and in\n[3797.5s] bondage. So that is how seventh day\n[3799.6s] Adventist found themselves in bondage\n[3801.6s] again.\n[3811.9s] the nations will find the truth through\n[3813.8s] the church. So whichever way it may be,\n[3817.7s] the only way that the nation can get the\n[3819.4s] truth is from the church. So imagine see\n[3821.9s] we took our children and they were\n[3823.4s] scattered in the bondage but still truth\n[3826.0s] came even in those universities did they\n[3828.7s] get those truths?\n[3831.5s] people got it. Another way if you joke\n[3834.1s] and you think you escaping this\n[3856.5s] Why don't you say amen? Amen.\n[3859.4s] The only way that God's truth can preach\n[3861.3s] the nation is through the church.\n[3864.1s] Therefore, this is how it is that the\n[3866.3s] church of Christ who is the body of the\n[3868.7s] Christ of Christ is the bail and the\n[3871.0s] ground, the support and the stay of the\n[3873.7s] truth in the world. It is that which\n[3875.7s] keeps alive the truth in the earth. Yes.\n[3877.8s] How then how then can the world obtain\n[3879.8s] the truth from me from me as of the\n[3881.8s] church of the church. When all my effort\n[3885.2s] listed this question this question\n[3888.2s] sister is going but you will come back\n[3890.2s] and check it. Amen. Yes. This is\n[3893.0s] important\n[3894.0s] question. Yes it together. How then can\n[3897.8s] the world obtain the truth from me of\n[3900.2s] the church? So the church when all my\n[3901.8s] efforts all your efforts are enlisted\n[3904.5s] are what? Enlisted and spend the\n[3907.1s] occupation. My brother, are you seeing\n[3909.6s] this? How then can the world bring good\n[3911.8s] from you when 6 days you are employed in\n[3914.2s] Lala community as of the church? As of\n[3916.8s] the church then all my efforts All your\n[3919.0s] efforts are enlisted what? Enlisted\n[3922.4s] Uhhuh. and spent in the world's\n[3924.2s] occupation. Uhhuh. And in the world's\n[3926.3s] philosophy of occupation Uhhuh. Can that\n[3928.6s] be done? Can that be done? No sir, the\n[3932.2s] world cannot see the church in me. The\n[3934.8s] world will not see the church in you if\n[3936.9s] you come to church in that condition of\n[3938.6s] things. In order for the truth to reach\n[3940.8s] the world by meh who am of the church,\n[3943.9s] it is essential that I shall do the work\n[3946.1s] as the work of the church. do the work\n[3949.9s] as so that we may not get\n[3957.8s] in order for the in order for the world\n[3960.6s] to reach in order for the truth to reach\n[3962.4s] the world by me by me who am of the\n[3965.5s] church who am of the church it is\n[3966.9s] essential that I shall do the work as\n[3969.5s] the work of the church the work as the\n[3971.5s] work of the church if I am a farmer if\n[3973.8s] you and I\n[3975.6s] think Even in farming you will be\n[3982.1s] told if I am a farmer I farmer of the\n[3987.7s] church. Hallelujah.\n[3990.2s] Amen. Farmer. Amen.\n[4000.4s] Because\n[4013.6s] farming and then you saying you are of\n[4015.9s] the\n[4019.9s] church means\n[4022.2s] This is the whole of\n[4036.1s] my teacher. If I'm a what? A teacher. If\n[4039.5s] I'm a teacher, I am a teachers of the\n[4041.5s] church. I'm a teacher of the church. A\n[4043.6s] representative of the church. A\n[4045.0s] representative of the church. I do my\n[4047.0s] work as the work of the church. I do my\n[4049.1s] work as the work of the church.\n[4050.6s] Therefore, therefore this calls that\n[4052.7s] every one of us who profess to belong to\n[4054.8s] the church shall so really belong to the\n[4057.2s] church that everything in our lives\n[4059.4s] everything in our lives in our actions\n[4061.4s] in our actions everything that comes in\n[4063.4s] the course of our lives shall be\n[4065.1s] distinctly of the church was that how\n[4067.0s] pioneers\n[4068.3s] were pioneers\n[4074.9s] among working in the world he was a\n[4077.3s] lecturer and also a pioneer\n[4093.0s] Okay.\n[4098.6s] It reads, \"Huh, therefore, therefore,\n[4101.2s] this cause that everyone of us who\n[4102.6s] profess to belong to the church shall so\n[4104.8s] really belong to the church that\n[4106.2s] everything in our lives in our actions,\n[4109.5s] everything that comes in the course of\n[4110.8s] our lives shall be distinctly of the\n[4113.0s] church shall relate to the church and we\n[4115.5s] will hold it up the glory of God as of\n[4118.2s] the church.\"\n[4119.4s] this the last one. Then then that church\n[4123.4s] will be so filled with the truth and\n[4125.5s] will be so sanctified by the truth with\n[4127.8s] which she is filled that the glory of\n[4129.8s] God which is in that truth will shine\n[4132.0s] forth. The world will see her that\n[4134.2s] glorious church which will be discussed\n[4137.0s] everywhere by the world. That church\n[4139.2s] that everything is for the church. You\n[4141.2s] teach us the church. The glory of the\n[4143.8s] Lord shall be seen upon thee. The word\n[4146.6s] will be fulfilled that she shall rise\n[4149.3s] and shine for her light is come and the\n[4152.1s] glory of the\n[4154.8s] Lord and the Lord is risen upon her. You\n[4157.9s] know that is so now all these only to\n[4161.7s] have said in other words that in the\n[4164.5s] days of the voice of the seventh angel\n[4166.8s] when he shall begin to sound the mystery\n[4169.2s] of God shall begin to sound. The myster\n[4171.1s] of God shall be fulfilled as he and\n[4173.4s] declare to his son the prophets. That\n[4175.8s] mystery of God finished is the gospel\n[4178.2s] preached to all the world that the end\n[4180.1s] may come. That ministry of God is\n[4181.9s] finished in the world is the work of God\n[4185.2s] finished in preaching the gospel to the\n[4186.8s] nation. And it is more than that. Along\n[4189.2s] with that, the mystery of God is God\n[4191.3s] manifest in the flesh. The finished\n[4193.2s] mystery of God is the\n[4195.3s] completion the perfection of the\n[4197.9s] manifestation of God in the flesh in the\n[4200.1s] believers in Jesus who belong to the\n[4202.1s] church. Thus there are two place\n[4204.7s] occupied in the finishing of the mystery\n[4206.2s] of God. One place in the world itself to\n[4208.9s] which the gospel is to be preached, the\n[4210.8s] other place in the lives of the\n[4212.0s] believers of the truth. We might preach\n[4214.0s] and proclaim in words to the ends of the\n[4216.6s] earth to every soul on earth in our\n[4219.8s] generation. So that face of the work\n[4221.8s] will be completed will be finished. Yet\n[4224.9s] if the man manifestation of God in the\n[4227.1s] lives of those who preach that is not\n[4229.1s] completed also we could be that thing\n[4231.6s] 10,000 years and the end will never\n[4234.3s] come. It is not simply\n[4239.6s] yet if the manifestation of God in the\n[4242.2s] lives of those who preach that is not\n[4244.6s] completed also we could preach that\n[4247.0s] thing 10,000 years and the end will\n[4250.6s] never come. is not simply that the\n[4253.2s] gospel shall be preached to all the\n[4254.6s] world and fill all the world but it is\n[4257.8s] that when it is done there shall be a\n[4260.2s] people ready to meet at the hand without\n[4263.0s] the finishing of the manifestation of\n[4264.7s] God in the flesh of each believer there\n[4267.0s] can be no finishing of the mystery of\n[4268.8s] God that mystery finished God manifest\n[4272.5s] the flesh mark it means that only God is\n[4276.4s] to be seen in every act of life or\n[4278.7s] believer so that in his life God is\n[4281.6s] manifest only that is the finish of the\n[4283.7s] mystery of God in the way that it counts\n[4286.2s] and you know that if that way were open\n[4290.1s] and God would take position and fill the\n[4292.1s] lives of the 25,000 professed believers\n[4294.9s] today it would be the easiest thing in\n[4297.2s] the world to reach all the nation so\n[4299.7s] that\n[4301.1s] end you know the mystery of God is\n[4303.4s] Christ in you the hope of glory then the\n[4306.4s] finished mystery of God is the finishing\n[4308.4s] of the growth the manifestation of\n[4310.0s] Christ the believer So that we shall\n[4312.0s] stand in this world in the image of\n[4314.0s] Jesus Christ reflecting only him. That\n[4316.6s] when the\n[4320.4s] believers when the believers shall be\n[4322.4s] seen only Christ will be seen.\n[4325.0s] Everything that is said, everything that\n[4326.9s] is done, every tone of voice, all that\n[4329.7s] we are will only of Christ only. That is\n[4333.1s] the finish of the mystery of God in\n[4334.7s] truth in the way that it counts. And\n[4337.2s] that is what has to come before the end\n[4339.6s] can come. That is a child that presents\n[4342.6s] to himself. Hallelujah. Are we far away\n[4347.4s] from are we do you think we are going to\n[4351.4s] make but we are we thank God we are in\n[4354.1s] the line. We are going what is it?\n[4362.9s] What is it?\n[4369.5s] Christian studies in Christian education\n[4371.8s] by EA Southerntherland.\n[4377.1s] [Music]\n[4387.8s] We can decide to be\n[4389.7s] employed. It is our choice. The youth\n[4392.3s] must decide for himself. But again, uh\n[4395.5s] you have seen in your own word. By the\n[4398.6s] end of the call here, we are going to\n[4400.2s] make a call for those who want to be\n[4401.7s] church members. By the way, Vuko, do you\n[4404.9s] think we are going to make it? This is\n[4407.7s] the\n[4408.8s] problem. It is it is the biggest\n[4411.5s] problem. So these talents which are\n[4413.8s] being taught if they're not going to be\n[4415.1s] of\n[4416.4s] church they\n[4430.7s] nothing have influence now read this\n[4433.8s] loudly\n[4436.2s] what's used is the preaching of the\n[4437.5s] gospel today while six days out of seven\n[4440.8s] paganis to get the intellect. What use\n[4444.7s] is the preaching of the gospel on one\n[4448.2s] week? One one day of the week while six\n[4451.7s] days out of the seven paganism guys the\n[4454.4s] intellect. That is\n[4458.4s] why the\n[4460.4s] school calls that those who are in the\n[4462.6s] pagan system of education if they\n[4465.0s] worship it is form of what? Godliness.\n[4468.3s] I hope you used to do it best in West of\n[4471.8s] God. That is why many people have gotten\n[4473.8s] lost today. They were so powerful in\n[4478.0s] church unless God help us. By the way,\n[4480.9s] without the help of God, nobody can be\n[4483.9s] found. But God is trying so\n[4494.8s] much the preaching of the gospel one day\n[4497.9s] of the week. One day of the week Sabbath\n[4500.1s] while six days out of the seven paganism\n[4502.3s] guides the intellect. Why sit dreaming\n[4504.6s] of heaven or spend Why is it doing what?\n[4507.8s] Dreaming of heavenh or spend money to\n[4511.0s] procelite. Money to process. Money to\n[4513.3s] process means money to do what? To\n[4525.9s] preach. So question why of what uses the\n[4529.3s] preaching of the gospel on one day of\n[4530.9s] the week while six days out of seven\n[4533.0s] paganism guys the intellect. Huh? Why is\n[4535.4s] he dreaming of heaven or spend money to\n[4537.8s] proite while pagan education leads your\n[4540.4s] own children by the hand? Even your\n[4543.2s] children again.\n[4545.6s] Uh-huh. Weaves about their mind and\n[4547.9s] network of theories which blinds their\n[4549.8s] eyes to spiritual\n[4551.8s] truths or students wake up to study how\n[4556.1s] many dogs how many teeth does a dog\n[4561.0s] have many dogs.\n[4565.8s] There's wait in the word of the pres\n[4568.2s] president Hara of Chicago University who\n[4570.6s] say it is difficult to prophesy what the\n[4573.4s] result of our present method education\n[4575.4s] the youth will be in 50 years. We are\n[4578.3s] training the mind in our public school\n[4580.6s] but the moral side of the child's nature\n[4583.0s] is almost entirely neglected.\n[4586.5s] The Roman Catholic cons insist on\n[4589.4s] remedying the this manifest evil. But\n[4592.9s] our Protestant churches seems to ignore\n[4595.4s] it completely. They expect the Sunday\n[4598.4s] school to make good oral public school\n[4601.9s] live and done and the consequence is\n[4604.4s] that we will look at danger as real\n[4607.4s] as great as any we had to face. Imagine\n[4611.8s] that is what\n[4620.8s] are you need to\n[4628.2s] teach? Why you in discipline is this one\n[4631.6s] of use and then you read school\n[4638.2s] teachers next time. I think if a parent\n[4641.8s] has refused getting this, there's no\n[4644.1s] need of bringing those children to come\n[4646.1s] and destroy people's children who are\n[4648.3s] struggling.\n[4650.8s] Hallelujah. When may God help us. I\n[4653.9s] don't want to talk much these things. I\n[4655.8s] I don't want to rob them their power in\n[4657.5s] Jesus name. Amen.\n[4665.0s] Let's digest it.\n[4668.6s] We s over these\n[4670.3s] things. Do you know one of the signs of\n[4672.6s] the last days when Christ was about to\n[4674.2s] go to heaven, he used to tell his\n[4675.7s] disciples that I will be arrested,\n[4679.2s] persecuted and on the third day and they\n[4681.7s] were sad and after the sec few hours\n[4685.4s] they were fighting for who is greatest.\n[4688.3s] So one of\n[4689.3s] the says that one of the we need to\n[4692.5s] study closely the life of Jesus\n[4694.2s] especially in the\n[4696.4s] last week is final scene. Final scene is\n[4700.5s] that the things will be taught to the\n[4702.0s] people of\n[4706.0s] God and then after 3\n[4710.3s] days and then next\n[4715.2s] time and then the following that is sign\n[4717.9s] of the last\n[4719.1s] days something for few minutes and no\n[4723.6s] action. Please God has given this\n[4726.2s] ministry powerful\n[4727.9s] message and those who would want to go\n[4730.5s] to heaven will have to separate. Let me\n[4733.1s] tell you the pioneers did a great work.\n[4736.2s] Some were teachers, some were medical\n[4738.4s] missionaries. They ate and they were\n[4740.3s] working all their money that the money\n[4741.9s] they were getting was for the work of\n[4743.4s] God and their families did not sleep\n[4745.4s] hungry.

And well what their rain uh dwell there and go not for then any weather. For it shall be that on that day somebody to continue reading. Yes.

Yes, thou shalt know for certain Thou shalt know for certain Yes. that thou shalt surely die. thou shalt surely die. Thy blood shall be upon thine own head. And thy blood shall be upon thy own what? Head. This is a man called who? Sheime. Please talk to me so that you may not sleep. This is a man called who? She. This may this is the king. This king is called who? David. King Solomon. King Solomon all of us know is the son of David. Yes. King Solomon was the king of Israel after David. And the Bible says, \"And the king sent and called for Shime.\" And then Sheime came. When Shime came, he told Mary, I want you to build what? And now see where? In Jerusalem. In Jerusalem. And dwell there. And dwell there. Verse number 37. He continued with this command. and told him, \"For it shall be that on that day thou goest out out and passeth over the brook of Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die die. Thy blood shall be upon all.\" Now she is told to build. I believe some of us might not know the story of I want you to go to second. Second Samuel there. Yes. Chapter chapter 16. I want us to start from verse five. I think Bible read. The Bible reads verse 5. Verse five. When the king David came to Bahin. Now listen to Sime being told to build a house. By the way, a chance is for all. I'll be giving a case study in the Old Testament and then I will I I'll run to a case study in the new world. Testament. Testament. A chance for all. That is my what? might read. And when the king David came to when the king David came to behold and came out a man of the family of the house of Saul a man of the family of house of who? Of Saul. Uhhuh. Whose name was she? So what was his name? Shime. Shime. Uhhuh. The son of Gera. The son of Gera. He came forth. He came forth and cast still as he came. And he cast as he came came I don't know you see he was cursing he was coming who was casting David the father who stoed by who by God and son you know that from the Bible story And the Bible says that as David was coming to bounding behind he was being what? This reminds me of a story in the year 2001. I was in Messiah. There was a a mother had daughters. I will not mention the name of the mother because the mother she speak in Masai is a friend to my mother. So I will not mention she had daughters. Those daughters used to abuse people. We used to stay with them in the rental houses when we 2001 2000. In fact they used to abuse until they can keep for 10 minutes. You are thinking that he had left you abused think of you I don't know I've even been in this where people you know I'm coming also from polyamas or when we used to be used to see my hallelujah. Amen. I know some of you have always seen them especially women are always find fond of those things. Now this man has for what was he doing? He was cast. Imagine that scene of a man who is coming from the family of Saul and remember Saul had died and this man is remaining and he's casting who David anointed one of God. Let's go. And he cast stones at David. What did he do? He cast stones. I wish I would make something in in in my laptop then I would have shown you how he's doing it. Imagine him casting and throwing stones. What is that? Are you seeing that scenario? He is Maui throwing to who? A king with Can you do that in 1969 for those who are historians here? The same thing took place in in Kisum when came with a party called KPU is it? Yes. And then Tom had been assassinated in broad daylight. And what happened when kata came to open the new raia here the lord started throwing what stones stones until the body to catch a stone and they oh this is stone you know what took place there was a great master from kisumu town until they reach in the land of kings they killed even the children playing around from Kisumui they killed until they entered into the land is when they said now because of the throne stone and Kenya did not come back to Kisum till he died in [Music] 1978 in which year 1978 he did not come imagine throwing a king imag with the same with the same Imagine just talking about a politician healed as we speak. You talk about the government, the incumbent government, he has these goons. You talk about the one aspiring they have and some as we speak and they also don't. Now we want to look at David as again king with soldiers. Now the Bible continues to say and they cast stone at David. Yes. and at all the servants of King David. All the servants of King David. All the people and all the mighty men. So he cast stones at David. And all the servants of King David and all the people and all the mighty men and all the mighty. So he had his sermons that mean soldiers, policemen with him. All the people and the mighty men with him. One on his right hand and on his left. Why? On his right hand on his what? left hand. Imagine the soldiers and mighty men. I believe you know in Kenya here we have the mighty men that where they you cannot even go closer there. So is only coming with what and he's throwing upon who so much courageous king know there are some people who are so much courageous even here in the church you are too much courageous I remember in the year 2013 I went to preach in a church called we boy and after preaching we had a group of youths then a man came to me old man and told me take this book there was a book called Daniel times he told me you have too much courage but you have nothing to preach. You are courageous but you don't know I don't know how to say that. How do you translate that? So courageous but what you preach with your courage is not there. You have courage but what you preach with courage is what you learn and then he gave me our time. I thank that man although he's dead as we speak. So this man was so much courageous. Imagine this is a king with policemen with soldiers with him with national intelligence service with him. But he still throws what? Thrones. Now go to the next scene. Say yes. When he cast when he cast come out he don't look what I tell the king. Come out. Come out thou bloody man. Thou bloody man. Thou man of B. Man of B. Who is B? Satan. David, David is man of Satan. And is bloody man verse eight. Verse eight. The Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul. Who said, \"Thou was rain.\" The Lord has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Abselum thy son. So look at the people who are making the people who made a tool. Yes. Do you know I realized that in the churches here we are there are people that only there to make others to meet a sinful death. These are the people who made to be tough and start fighting as well. So you man what you did to King Saul? But again now if you read about the story of David and Saul by the way David refused to do what to kill. The seven time he found Saul Saul was looking for him to kill him. You know that the soul even lied that he want somebody to to sing that the evil spirit may want and David was playing and he threw the what? Yes. And what happened? So ran away. He looked for David to cave. There's a time David even found him inside a valley when he was living till David had to cut rent a clothes so that that one will be a witness that I'm not going to do what to kill you. To kill you. Hallelujah. Amen. But the Bible says here that was saying he's the one who has killed who? So was this a lie? So look at how the lines are there. this man so much carriers with the lies. Now it continues to say and behold and behold thou were taken in thy mischief because thou a bloody man a bloody man. Verse n then say to then say the son of Zera the son of the unto the king the king. Why should this dead dog cast thy lord the king? Who you see? By the way, if you go to the king and start abusing come here at home, are you a dog? What is this doing? Let me go over. Let me go over. I pray thee, I pray thee, take off his head. Let him take his head. He has nothing. Let me take his sword what is the head. What of you? Take his hand very fast. And the king said, the king said, \"What have I to do with you?\" You son of Zera, you son of So let him cast. Let him cast. Because the Lord has said unto him, said, \"Let him cast.\" Maybe the Lord has said unto him, unto him, cast David, cast David, who shall then say, who shall then say, wherefor thou done so? Imagine this man was abusing Saul David stones. Doing a lot and tell the soldiers, Mr. Allow me to go and chop his head off. Then he say, please allow him do that. allow him do who knows that is the Lord who has told him to do unto why David has done a lot of problems. His son at the same time has left with his what? as at the same time the his son is chasing him want to kill him at the same time in his arms the his son called who the one who raped the tama who I'm known as in the same family he had a lot of problems at the same time he has killed who and has taken the what and their first child is what dead So problems it is let's go to the next verse to do that somebody may do to you and you don't complain please let him do I've seen somebody saying we talking like you Have we ever had people when they being abused they say maybe God maybe it is my sins that is making me to be can we reach at a particular moment imagine in the church that when somebody talk about you say maybe God has ability him to do that maybe I should learn a lesson from what he's doing maybe this what David is saying don't do anything to him maybe it is the god who has allowed him to do that now let's go to next verse because of time And David said to Abishai, David said to his son and to all his servants, Yes. Behold, behold my son, my son, which came forth of my bowels, if my son have given birth to this one is coming from the family of my son given birth to seeketh my life. Seek my life. How much more now? How much more now? May this Benjamite do it. Benjamite, let him alone. Let him alone. Let him cast. Let him cast. The Lord has been him. Hallelujah. Let me say this to those who do not. I think all of us understand English. I believe all of us. My mother I think understands English because he went to school and I believe she understands. Those are the old women here over 50 and above. Have you ever system where your children your own home is against you? You have a problem in your own family that now problems come from outside you say no [Music] please is the one who seeketh my life. one of that person from another village, from another place. Let let them do maybe God is the one doing this. Maybe it is God. And imagine this person is cursing a king who was anointed by Leave him alone. Don't kill him. So Sime was to die. He's baptized. Sime was to be what? But he is saying please leave him. Why? It may be God who has bidden me to do what? To do that to me. To the right verse. I want to write very fast. It may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction. It may be the Lord will look into my on my affliction. And that the Lord will requit me. And the Lord will requit me. Uhhuh. Good for his cursing this day. The Lord will requit me. Uhhuh. Good for cursing me this day. Maybe the Lord will look on mine. What? Let him just read. Maybe the Lord can see. Maybe the Lord will look on my word. I'm spiritual. The things I'm passing through and the Lord may do what requ Can we have such people here in the church of God? I don't know. Let that continue very fast. And as David and his men were by the way, she went along on this hillside. She went along. He did not stop. He went along on the hillside. On the hillside over against him again. And as he went, and threw stones at him. He was stere and cast dust dust and the king and the king and all the people that were with him were became weary came weary and refresh themselves there weary do you know abusing do you know how cursing do you know talking he about people makes people tired do you know today we are in wives whereby women are tired because of how the husbands talk about that. Do you know we have people today in the church they are because of criticisms condemnation one what made them to be weary that they refuses the throwing of strokes there so much then the Bible says that all the people that the men of Israel came to Jerusalem with I will not go to because I talked about last summer. I wanted you wanted to see how was to be killed. David says please leave S alone. Leave him. Leave him alone. Maybe there does nothing to that. He leaves him to live. And then Solomon came to take the kingship. 36 came very well what this man did to his father. He knew if you say that therefore he come upon you from the verse 31 to him do fall upon him and burn him. The Lord shall return his blood upon him. You can read it. I'm not going to read that. And then verse 35, the king of the priest and did the king in the room of Abiata. And then verse 36. And the king said and called she and said unto him, \"Build me a house in Jerusalem and dwell there and go not for it shall be from that day thou going out and passes over and thou shall know for that what the king saying is the gold is gold what?\" graces. Imagine some of there are people even in this room that do not talk with some people because they sin that was done to them long time ago. Maybe 10 years ago they not talking they in the church of God. There are people here who are not talking to others because others are wrong with their parents and they in the church of God preaching what we got faith. Look at this man, the spirit of David. Spirit of his son and build an house in where? Jerusalem. The day you will go any good. And my lord the king say what is what? Thank you so much. And they dwell in Jerusalem for many what? Many days. For many what days. Please read with me verse 38. He looked in Jerusalem for many days. Many days. And it came to pass. It came to pass at the end of three years. After he stayed after how many years? Three years. After how many years? Three years. Remember in the Jewish economy 3 years when somebody has taken the service in the service of God he was to be ordained among the wildes and the Jewish 3 years was somebody to stay in the hard cities when he was to be given a responsibility of taking a particular church. The same with the pioneers it was 3 years look this man stayed three what? three years. And it came to pass at the end of three years to pass three years that the two of the servants of Shime unto Akish unto Akish, the son of Maka, king of G. And they told Shimeme, saying, \"Thy servant be in G. Thy servant be G.\" Uh-huh. And she arose. She rose and suddenly suddenly and went to God. to G to Akish his servant and Shme went and brought his servant from G and it was told Solomon that Shme had gone from Jerusalem to G to G and was come again imagine he went came again he went and died out he went out and he came back things that people do not know he went he thinks that Solomon do not know anywhere and he was told please be do not come out of where Jerusalem he went please your other side and what did he do went and brought went himself very fast broke come back very fast and when he came he didn't know his provision is what it's closed closed he was given a chance again imagine if you read let's go to verse number 41 it says yes and it was told Solomon told that she had gone from Jerusalem to God. From Jerusalem to God, and was come again. Was come again. And the king sent and called for Shib was called was called and said unto him said unto him, did I not make thee to swear by the Lord? I made you to swear before the Lord and protest unto thee, say, know for a certain on the day that thou goest out, and walkest abroad by hither, yes, that thou shalt surely die. Thou shalt surely die. Thou said unto me, said unto me, the word that heard is good. The word that heard is is good. Is that how we also say when you have accepted the truth it is good the message is good I will walk in the way we thank God and even promise it is what can you remember our baptism of vows when we make vow with God you read that and then people say it is what verse number 42 42 I've read verse 43 why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord why have you not kept the vows you made and the commandment that I have charged thee with. 44. The king said moreover to Sheime. Listen to this verse says the king said moreover to Shme, thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is private to that thou didest to David my father. You remember what he did to his father? He abused the father of David. He was to die. But this me was not to live. See me he said was to be jumped once. Oh, but what happened? Was given probation time. David was so much gracious. I'm wondering about David. David was so much That is why God says David's heart is after his own heart. You know what you did to my world. Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is private to. Yes. That thou didest to David my father. Yes. Therefore the Lord shall return thy weakness upon thy own head. Yes. And King Solomon shall be blessed. Shall be blessed. The throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever. Amen. So the king commanded Baniah the son of Jodia which went out and fell upon it that he died and the kingdom was established in the heart of Solomon. The kingdom of Solomon was established. Amen. Grace of a loving God. Praise the tit mountain out for the way the blood of the lamb was plead gra and and grad all surely s was not to leave. S did wickedness was to be chopped longtime. Sime was not to leave. Do you think even even you look at was he again live again next to David's son he was unworthy but he was given infinite grace. In fact he was even brought to live in Jerusalem not to go anywhere again. He was to leave. He was told he even swel in fact Solomon was not even to talk with this. Do you have you ever been you know there are things which are so sad? Have you ever been in a family and you see somebody abusing your your mother you abuse and talking about you you have you ever seen or your father somebody come and your father in front of you and you big people is it so sad I don't unless you are man slap that mouth of that boy hardly so that he may be able to wake up sit well you are sitting apparate as well amen Now somebody abusing your father or somebody come and beat your mother in your presence. How do you feel? You'll feel how will you feel that somebody slap your mother and kick and you're sitting down and you're big people that person's pricking and then following one year you find that person who kicked your mother they there staying together in the same house and how will you feel it is so sad imagine this man is now living with Solomon Solomon gives him another chance and then later on he breaks went out to the world, comes back to Jerusalem. Remember Jerusalem represent what? The house of God. The house of God. Is that right? Yes. Where God's act of covenant was found. He runs and then comes back again. And when he comes back, his grace is what? Over. Grace is now over. Proverbial is closed. I'm taking another case study and then I pray because my time is almost up. Acts 12 verse 25. There's another man. Bible reads who also went and I I want to tell you that some of us may be taking examples in this last days we can with the vows we are making to work for God you sometimes we can make vibes we don't understand sometimes we entering upon the and that's me young people have made decisions and they think they making they do not understand some people even gone from baptism they don't understand and that is why we are tired jokes and ced and are falling upon some even given themselves on things they do not understand so that when other things come when other messengers bring them some messages please run over there run over there and then they can run there and after some time come back anytime they want and they think that they are still They did and they made vow they think that they making vow to man and not to God. Hallelujah. And this is thought it is a joke. He did not know how wickedness he was. He did not know that he only got grace. And that is why many young people today do not know that this song we are making, the vibes we are making as we speak in this last days, they do not know it is the last chance that we just been given and they are choosing so and so did this, so and so did this. But let me tell you, you may go and you going that was your final chance. Hallelujah. Acts 12 verse 25. Barnabas again. Let's take another case study before we pray. Read Acts 12 verse number 25. The Bible says and Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem. Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem. They had filled their ministry. that what filled their ministry that fulfilled their ministry ministry and took with them John with them a man called who John John whose son name was Mark whose son name was Mark so his name was John Mark who took him and they were preaching they found a man they found what and man his name was called who John chapter 13 Verse number 13, the Bible reads, \"Now when Paul and his company lose from Puffos, now when Paul and his what? His company loosed from Pos, they came to Pa. They came to Pah in Pilia. And John departing from them. John departed from them in fact. These verses have taken me to not be praying. Act 12. Saul and who? And Barnabas took who? John Mark in their minist. They took him so that this man may join them in the work of God. In Acts 13, the Bible simply says who departed. Now when Paul and his family come loose from Paposh, they came to P and Pilia and John departed from them to return to Jerusalem. John departed. He left the two men and departed from where? Jerusalem. Jun went to Jerusalem. He departed and left. Let's go very fast 169. I'm remaining with two and we pray. Read this one. Write them down. 169 it reads was not a man of education. I've said 69. Yes. Yes. I want people to see there somebody doing it very was not a man of education. Yes. Yet he was paragraph paragraph two. Paul and his company continued their journey. Paul and his company their journey going to p in failure. Failure. Their way was to their way was toome. They encountered hardship and privations. They encountered what? Hardship and privations. Paul the the disciples they encountered what hardship and privations privations and were beset with dangers on every side by ders on every road every side side in the towns and cities the towns and cities through which they passed through which they passed along the lonely highways along the road lonely highway lonely highways they were surrounded by b dangers seen and unseen they were so surrounded by what dangers dangerous seen and unseen seen and what and unseen unseen but Paul But Paul and Barnabas and Barnabas had learned to trust God's power to deliver. To do what? Trust God's power to deliver. Hallelujah. Amen. So Barnabas and what? And Paul seen and what? Unseen of the gospel. Paul to me and Paul to trust God's power to deliver. Amen. Amen. They knew it is God who will take care of them. Now continue reading. It says, \"Yes, their hearts were filled with perent love.\" Perfect love for perishing souls. What they wanted was to go and look for the Lord. There's a song saying resue the perishing care for the dying. You mean you're an Adventist, you don't know how to sing. You want you want to be given a number is when you say and you're entering upon Sunday law. You are going to be in Mama Janet was in for more than 10 days. Tell them if you go with song books if you have been in cell for 7 days. Ask us, you have to put it. And you arrested here on Sabah. You remember that? There you are there without your mother or your father. You don't even want them to know. 367 hours and you have a Bible, a song. Can you do because you have not been arrested? But if you accept this message, you will go, you'll be arrested. Amen. No King James, no song book, and you'll also be eating dangerous food. Hallelujah. So if I say rescue the sweetish sn weep all the airing one lift up the fallen. In the name of Jesus the mighty to save resue the share for the Jesus is merciful. Jesus will say hallelujah. These people they had where were you reading? It says but Paul their hearts were filled with perfect love for perishing souls. lack obearing soul. As faithful shepherds, as faithful shepherds, in search of the lost sheep, in search of the lost sheep, they gave no thought to their own ease and convenience. They thought to their own what? Ease and convenience. Ease and convenience. Forgetful of self, forgetful of self. They felt not weary when we they what they faltered not this please those young people make decisions. Look, they falter. Some people when they become tired in the work of God, they falters. They they do things which are very and you want to look at this read. Forgetful of self, forgetful of self. They faltered not when weary. They fought not when we hungry. Hungry and cold. And cold. They had in when they were hungry, when there was no food, when they did have a they faltered. known they had in their view but one object object one object the salvation of those who had those who had wandered from the fall they wanted people to come back to the truth like today all churches I showed you in the prophecy at night that the churches are we are in the wers of what Canada churches have been accumulation Our churches are their main aim was to bring people to the truth to the f of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. Those were the men that were called. But as they were doing that work, Mark joined them. But look here, it was here that Mark, it was overwhelmed with fear and discouragement. When there was no food, people are Hey, please look here. It was here that there was opposition, there was weariness, privation, cold, coldness, no enough clothes, hunger. It was here that Mark, please, those who are not reading, read loudly with me. It was Mark over overwhelmed with fear discouragement wavered for a time wavered for what a time in his purpose to give himself wholehearted to the Lord's work said I cannot be a full-time minist I fear it is possible it is not possible for me it is impossible for a time you know look look at that quotation You see what did she do? She say check with me. Check what also Mark is saying here. Read again. It was here. Look at who? Please look here. He said it was here that Mark It was here that Mark overwhelmed with fear and discouragement. Discouragement wavered for a time. Wavered for a time in his purpose to give himself to the Lord. for a means he give himself for a means or something he will later on he may give himself what wholeheartedly oh really it was here that Mark it was overwhelmed with fear and discouragement overwhelmed and feel discouraged wavered for a time for a time his purpose to give himself hearted to the world's work and used to hardship and he used to hardship hardship he was disheartened he was disheartened by the perils Privation of the way they're used to what privations of the wives what hardship I I I want to know the mother of mark I don't you know hardship please children teach these children and I thank my father and my mother here my mother is here I thank them with us when I look at our life at home it was life of hardship amenship I remember when we were young we had only two benches in our Amen. With my sisters, this young man, my brother, we were working in fact My mother is here. hours by 2000 brothers. brothers. Now you have big brothers. They were in class 8 and I was in class one. Life of good. Amen. Amen. I didn't know that that was preparing me for the gospel work. Let me tell you those make decision. This gospel work is very difficult. Amen. Amen. That those are used. I remember when I was going to high school, I cried to the mother and the mother used to tell me, \"You are with your father working for the whole day. What did you do to me? Go back. You are there. And then we go to school without. So what did we do when we go to school in the bathroom? In fact, when it is 3 weeks for people to close because you know when people and then by the end of the time I remember I went to school with not given pocket money. What I was doing I eat it that day so that I may not think something over the box. I study in class. Life of what? And whom that life was preparing because this gospel that you want to make decision is life for. No, there are things that we pass and sometimes you can hate your parents but later on when you sit down you read Romans 8:28 then you say all things work together for good for those who love God and are called to his purpose. Hallelujah. Praise God. And used to what? Hardship. Hardship. They were using in good house electricity mopping with this gospel but God still calls them. Why don't you say amen? Let's read. I'm almost finishing. And he used to worship and used to worship. He was disheartened by the privilege and privation of the way. He had labored with success. He had leed with success unfavorable circumstances. Unfavor. So those are used toward they can labor with success in favorable circumstances. when there's something they get there's food there's brown rice chapel there's fair oh that is favorable war circumstance but now a minister of position a minister what opposition was too much and perils and perils that so often beset the pioneer work that so what often beset the pioneer work God is calling us to a pioneer work we are going back to the old ACD to the faith of the adventist which all charges our general depart from the truth. This is the time we were establishing the Christian world church. We also called in the same work going back to the old ways. It is very difficult for those who will be coming forward. I've been preaching here and men and young ladies are coming forward. that a time cometh that there's not even shoes. A time cometh that you may not have even clothes. A time reaches that when you have a coat and they try new one which somebody has given you. Some people think that maybe maybe nowadays they saw where you get things. It is very if you don't have you are poor go and do something. If you are this one you might have stolen somewhere. It is very difficult. Hallelujah church. Hallelujah. It is very difficult that sometimes you cannot even get money to save your air. Very difficult. But we are told that at such a time is when Mark says it is not possible. I'm going back. Cannot do that. Read. Read with me very fast. He felt he knew hardness as a good soldier of the cross. Good soldier of the cross. He had yet to learn to face danger. He had yet to learn to face danger and persecution and persecution. Adversity with a brave heart. Adversity with a brave heart. Adverse with a brave heart. As the apostle advanced as the apostle advanced and still great difficulties were apprehended. Yes. Mark was intimidated. Mark was intimidated and losing all courage and losing all courage. Refused to go further and return to Jerusalem. He said, \"I'm not going with this. This is not a gospel. Gospel with persecution. You know this gospel sometimes very difficult that there are things you may be going through that you don't even want your brothers to know. This gospel is very tough that sometimes you can cry in a cell. Sometimes it is tough that you even don't know how to start. Sometimes things are so tough that you sit somewhere and say how do I start these things? It is very difficult. At that time his Wendy and Mark said this thing Paul and Barabas is doing and every time they trust in God I was reading about Joseph B when the wife call and ask him give us money for food and the answer was God will provide. You said we are tired with God. Every time we provide that every time we have why can we go to the last quotation conflict and courage this the last one 348 paragraph 2 and three and then you jump to 349 and then we pray. Please friends youth must decide for himself but which decision. Do you understand the decision you are making? Did Mark understand? Mark entered the gospel without understanding the obligation. S was also making an obligation without understanding and please do not get opportunity. We want also see this one. Read with me. Mark bring him with you for he find him useful. That is second Timothy what? Mark's what? Mark's mother was a convert to the Christian religion. Christian religion. Mark's mother was a convert. backh and what and home Jerusalem Jerusalem is an asylum to the disciples. Hallelujah. Amen. So Mark Mark's mother's house was an isel. All preachers used to go to mother's Mark's home. I love the mothers of Mark. Mark's mother was a good mother. What do you say man? There are mothers here that you cannot go to their homes. My mother thank you did not ask me such question when ministers used to come to our home. This woman was very good. Amen. Amen. Can God give us this other mother. So there are mothers if we go to their home. Amen. Hallelujah. Ma and you know how ministers when they get a place they can go, they will go. Amen. I I think this mother was peaceful. Mark's mother was a convert to the Christian religion. Amen. At home at Jerusalem was an assam for the Mark proposed to Mark was there seeing how the mother was welcoming. Then Mark was touring with ministers in the table and he said to Paul and he said that he should accompany them on their missionary tour go with you the missionary tour. He has proposed he not understand and that is the problem today with men who enter into the ministry without understanding the obligation. They don't understand. That is why we can enter any we want and leave anytime we want. We don't understand. We just love going to miss. People are going to miss. Can we go? Can we go? Oh, you're the minister. Let us go. Now, when things become difficult, when you are taking one year with one sweater, you say, \"Oh, I thought I'm going to be like a district. There are people here. There are ministers. They are just proposing. Can we go in a few minutes? We need to help our parents. We need to Mark also proposed to Paul and Barnabas. Yes. That he should accompany them on their missionary tour. He felt the favor of God in his heart and long to devote himself entirely to the work of the gospel. To be to be a fulltime what? Minister. Young man, how many are longing to be full-time ministers? You are longing. We thank God. Longing. I want to give my life entirely to the gospel. You think it is a joke. Ask those who have tried it here. It is not a joke. Ask their mothers. My mother is here. Go with him. Ask is Maxwell sending you something per month. He will tell you. Amen. Hallelujah. That's what difficult. Some people do not understand it. So it was just longing. Now look after longing. Their way was to they encountered hardship. They encountered hardship and privation and were beset with das on every but Paul and Barnabas in learn to trust God's heart. Their hearts were filled with fervent love for perishing spirit. A shful shepherd in search of the lost sheep. They gave thought to their own ease and conveniences. ease and what? Conveniences. Forgetful of self. They faltered not when merry not when weary when weary hungry hungry and called they had in their view but one object. Salvation of those who had wondered far from the fall. Please imagine we had a people with one object. You know nowadays people come to the ministry with se several objects. Somebody come to the ministry and gives the church the list. When I've come to minister you know my mother you have to build a house for him for her. You know yeah you will be close my mother you know you buy buy for me a land in the country you must build for me. I say I'm preaching for you. So those list if you will fulfill them we can go and preach. No, but with these people they had one what? Object. What? What was the object? What? They the they had view but one object. Salvation. Those who were worried one far from the fall. Next point. Mark will be fear and discouragement and discouragement wavered for a time in his for a time in his purpose purpose to give himself wholehearted Lord's word and he used to worship and he used to worship. He was disheartened by the perish and prevision of the way. He had yet to learn to face danger and persecution, adversity with a brave heart. As the apostle advanced and still great difficulties were apprehended, Mark was intimidated. And losing all courage, refused to go further and return to Jerusalem. This decision caused Paul to judge Mark unfavorably. Mark judged Paul. Paul judged Mark unfavorably. Unfavorably. is not like David. Paul is not like what? David. Paul judged Mark what? Unfavorably. Imagine the one who was not judged like was not judge unfavorable. David said, \"Please leave him. Please leave him.\" But look what did Paul do? The decision caused Paul to judge unfavorably. Unfavorably. And even severely. That one thing is 15 we are not going to read. And he judged him severely. He refused because now people were going back and when Mark came people said Mark is joking. Mark is joking. Mark cannot leave us in the field and then go and rest when things were tough and then when things are new with people we cannot work with there people in ministry talking like that. So and so has been leaving us and coming this time around. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Mark judged that Paul judged Mark. Paul judged Mark unfavorable and even severe injuries they were fight they were almost fighting there was sharp contention in Acts 15:36 sharp contention Paul was mistaken what he said is final people love Paul but Paul had something till people separated And then for a Some people are going to come back because somebody do not want them. Look, Mark did not think of what Paul is thinking about him. But we told that Barnabas has encouraged him. Don't we have Barnabas today here who is able to encourage young men to keep the faith? Yes, we have. Don't we have also people like Paul who thinks that others should not be given opportunity? Yes, they are there. They were there with during the time of who of of of David. There was one who said, \"Can we chop his head off?\" What's that? Abishai. Abby. Don't we have also with the spirit of Paul? But still there was grace. In both there was grace both for and for who? John Mark. How are you going to use that grace? Friends, the work is great and the youth must decide for themselves. Please, the messages we're bringing on to you are hard. The messages that being presented by ministers there are hard they are notice and sometimes when you see people making decisions in this church it is not simp this faith is very hard for you to preach there are lot of things waiting for us it needs those who are going to give themselves unreservedly not with what feelings and those are the people God is calling friends hallelujah and the youth mass and there's a grace if If you get lost, it will be up. But if this anybody will get lost with this opportunity we have gotten, your blood will be upon thee. I'm seeing s is being killed by bay and he's told we killing you and your blood is upon you. Please when the probation will end and we are getting lost in this oldest demo, we will get lost with all these messages which are being brought. Some are even thought by young men, young boys that even your children are older than them. And then we just simply neglect these messages. Please when we get lost, we are going to be killed. Sime is being killed in the presence of Solomon. Ben is taking his tool and is being slaughtered. And then he told your blood thee with all those grace. Please imagine after getting all these messages after sitting in these powerful meetings halls eating and serving every day coming here messages are being presented. There's old men in this meeting. There's young men presenting singing here and then you just simply reject you just simply take this thing for granted. You say it is good. You need the messages you present. And this is how me talk. It is good the way you also talk. Your message is good. I've seen young men calling. I know the messages you preach is good. They are good. They are good. No, that is Bab. They are good. I accept those messages. That is how she also took the message. Please friend as we pray and go for lunch. Sime is being slaughtered and is being killed by told we are killing you and your blood is upon your what? And I'm told that the wicked also when they will be killed their blood will be upon them. They have rejected the redeemer. Please which excuse will we give when there are others like we are and the God second opportunity and used to please in this meeting God is going to give another second opportunity. We have messed we are wicked we are to die. We have even woripped idols and worship of idol is death but God has given us opportunity. Amen. God has again brought us a message. We were to die and God said please with all the wind let that person live. Maybe you know not and you have got another opportunity. Others wanted us even not to be in this work. People have some do not even need us to be here. Some parents did not want us to be here. But God allowed you to be here. Some churches didn't want you to be here. There were promises of goods, but God gave you another chance. Are you going to mess it up? Are you going to again take it that you are also going to run again, goes back to the world for some time and come back leaving work anytime you want and come back anytime you want. May God help us in Jesus name. How many desire help? Let me see by would you stand up as we finish. Now let me make this one call. Today I'm making one call. I will be making final call next Sabbath. One call here. Is there somebody here like this young man? You left the work of God and you want God to give you a second chance and you want to use it not as he may use it but as John Mark used it until John Mark now we read the book of Mark which is a powerful book. Is there somebody like that? You had given yourself to the work of God. But because of challenges, because of hardships, because of things which are tough in the work of God, because of opposition and persecution, because of coldness and anger, because of the things we meet, you thought to run and go back to your mother's house to Jerusalem, but you want God to give you another chance. There's a chance for all. There's a chance for what? Who is there somebody who needs such a chance that God help you to give yourself unreserved for this work? Please there's a space a small I don't want many people. I want just one person or two. This space is small. It's not meant for all of you. So I only need someone here to come for prayers. Can I even get a one one to pray with? I don't want many people here. I only need one.",

Now listen\n[149.8s] to Sime being told to build a house. By\n[152.2s] the way, a chance is for all.

And when the king David came\n[172.6s] to when the king David came to\n[176.6s] behold and came out a man of the family\n[179.5s] of the house of Saul a man of the family\n[183.5s] of house of who?

He came\n[193.3s] forth and cast still as he came. And he\n[195.7s] cast as he came came I don't know you\n[199.8s] see he was\n[202.4s] cursing he was\n[211.6s] coming who was casting David the father\n[215.5s] who\n[219.0s] stoed by who by God and son you know\n[223.0s] that from the Bible story And the Bible\n[225.4s] says that as David was coming to\n[228.5s] bounding\n[240.0s] behind he was being what? This reminds\n[243.4s] me of a story in the year 2001. I was in\n[247.1s] Messiah. There was a a mother had\n[249.9s] daughters. I will not mention the name\n[251.6s] of the mother because the mother she\n[253.9s] speak in Masai is a friend to my mother.\n[256.6s] So I will not mention she had daughters.\n[259.0s] Those daughters used to abuse people. We\n[261.5s] used to stay with them in the rental\n[263.5s] houses when we 2001 2000. In fact they\n[268.4s] used to abuse until they can\n[270.8s] keep for 10 minutes. You are thinking\n[273.2s] that he had left\n[284.4s] you\n[286.2s] abused\n[294.1s] think of you I don't know I've even been\n[297.0s] in this where people you know I'm coming\n[299.2s] also from polyamas or when we used to be\n[302.2s] used to see\n[307.0s] my hallelujah. Amen. I know some of you\n[310.0s] have always seen them especially women\n[312.4s] are always find fond of those things.\n[315.4s] Now this man has for what was he doing?\n[318.7s] He was cast. Imagine that scene of a man\n[324.2s] who is coming from the family of Saul\n[326.2s] and remember Saul had died and this man\n[328.6s] is remaining and he's casting who David\n[332.1s] anointed one of God. Let's go. And he\n[335.8s] cast stones at David. What did he do? He\n[338.4s] cast stones.\n[340.4s] I wish I would make something in in in\n[343.1s] my laptop then I would have shown you\n[345.3s] how he's doing it. Imagine him casting\n[347.3s] and throwing stones.\n[350.2s] What is that? Are you seeing that\n[352.2s] scenario? He is Maui throwing to who? A\n[357.0s] king with Can you do that in 1969 for\n[360.2s] those who are historians here? The same\n[362.0s] thing took place in in Kisum when came\n[365.8s] with a party called KPU is it? Yes. And\n[369.1s] then Tom had been assassinated in broad\n[372.6s] daylight. And what happened when kata\n[375.3s] came to open the new raia\n[377.9s] here the lord started throwing what\n[380.6s] stones stones until the body to catch a\n[383.7s] stone and they oh this is stone you know\n[385.8s] what took place there was a great master\n[388.6s] from kisumu town until they reach in the\n[392.0s] land of kings they killed even the\n[393.8s] children playing around from\n[397.5s] Kisumui they killed until they entered\n[399.9s] into the land is when they said now\n[403.9s] because of the throne stone and Kenya\n[405.8s] did not come back to Kisum till he died\n[407.8s] in\n[409.9s] [Music]\n[411.7s] 1978 in which year\n[414.5s] 1978 he did not come imagine throwing a\n[417.8s] king\n[424.6s] imag with the same with the same\n[432.4s] Imagine just talking about a\n[437.1s] politician healed as we speak. You talk\n[440.2s] about the government, the incumbent\n[441.8s] government, he has these goons. You talk\n[444.7s] about the one aspiring they have and\n[447.0s] some as we speak and they also don't.\n[449.4s] Now we want to look at David as again\n[451.7s] king with soldiers. Now the Bible\n[453.8s] continues to say and they cast stone at\n[456.0s] David. Yes. and at all the servants of\n[458.2s] King David. All the servants of King\n[460.1s] David. All the people and all the mighty\n[462.4s] men. So he cast stones at David. And all\n[466.7s] the servants of King David and all the\n[470.6s] people and all the mighty men and all\n[472.7s] the mighty. So he had his sermons that\n[474.6s] mean soldiers, policemen with him. All\n[478.2s] the people and the mighty men with him.\n[481.3s] One on his right hand and on his left.\n[483.3s] Why? On his right hand on his what? left\n[486.2s] hand. Imagine the soldiers and mighty\n[489.5s] men. I believe you know in Kenya here we\n[492.5s] have the mighty men that where they you\n[494.3s] cannot even go closer there.\n[497.5s] So is only coming with what\n[502.6s] and he's throwing upon who so much\n[505.5s] courageous king know there are some\n[507.4s] people who are so much courageous even\n[509.2s] here in the church you are too much\n[511.2s] courageous\n[513.9s] I remember in the year 2013 I went to\n[517.0s] preach in a church called we boy and\n[518.6s] after preaching we had a group of youths\n[520.9s] then a man came to me old man and told\n[523.4s] me take this book there was a book\n[525.0s] called Daniel times he told me you have\n[527.4s] too much courage but you have nothing to\n[529.1s] preach. You are courageous\n[532.4s] but you don't know I don't know how to\n[536.3s] say that.\n[540.8s] How do you translate that? So courageous\n[542.7s] but what you preach with your courage is\n[544.2s] not there. You have courage but what you\n[547.0s] preach with courage is what you learn\n[549.3s] and then he gave me\n[551.7s] our time.\n[554.2s] I thank that man although he's dead as\n[557.2s] we speak. So this man was so much\n[560.2s] courageous.\n[562.9s] Imagine this is a king\n[565.2s] with policemen with soldiers with him\n[569.0s] with national intelligence service with\n[571.3s] him. But he still throws what? Thrones.\n[575.0s] Now go to the next scene. Say yes. When\n[578.6s] he cast when he cast come out he don't\n[581.3s] look\n[582.1s] what\n[584.9s] I tell the king. Come out. Come out thou\n[588.5s] bloody man. Thou bloody man. Thou man of\n[590.9s] B. Man of B. Who is B? Satan.\n[595.5s] David, David is man of Satan. And is\n[598.4s] bloody man\n[601.1s] verse eight. Verse eight. The Lord hath\n[603.1s] returned upon thee all the blood of the\n[605.1s] house of Saul. Who said, \"Thou was\n[607.7s] rain.\" The Lord has delivered the\n[609.8s] kingdom into the hand of Abselum thy\n[611.6s] son.\n[616.2s] So look at the people who are\n[619.7s] making the people who made a tool.\n[623.5s] Yes. Do you know I realized that in the\n[626.4s] churches here we are there are people\n[629.2s] that only there to make others to meet a\n[633.0s] sinful death. These are the people who\n[635.8s] made to be tough and start fighting as\n[638.9s] well.\n[640.9s] So you man what you did to King Saul?\n[644.0s] But again now if you read about the\n[645.8s] story of David and Saul by the way David\n[648.5s] refused to do what to kill. The seven\n[651.3s] time he found Saul Saul was looking for\n[653.4s] him to kill him. You know that the soul\n[656.0s] even lied that he want somebody to to\n[659.3s] sing that the evil spirit may want\n[663.5s] and David was playing\n[671.3s] and he threw the what?\n[673.7s] Yes. And what happened? So ran away.\n[679.4s] He looked for David to cave. There's a\n[681.6s] time David even found him inside a\n[684.1s] valley when he was living till David had\n[686.8s] to cut rent a clothes so that that one\n[689.9s] will be a witness that I'm not going to\n[691.8s] do what to kill you. To kill you.\n[693.7s] Hallelujah. Amen. But the Bible says\n[696.2s] here that was saying he's the one who\n[699.0s] has killed who?\n[701.0s] So was this a lie?\n[703.7s] So look at how the lines are there. this\n[706.7s] man so much carriers with the lies. Now\n[710.0s] it continues to say and behold and\n[712.2s] behold thou were taken in thy mischief\n[715.0s] because thou a bloody man a bloody man.\n[718.9s] Verse n then\n[720.8s] say to then say the son of Zera the son\n[725.4s] of the unto the king the king. Why\n[727.8s] should this dead dog cast thy lord the\n[729.8s] king? Who you\n[735.6s] see? By the way, if you go to the\n[738.7s] king and start\n[741.0s] abusing come here at home, are you a\n[746.8s] dog? What is this doing?\n[750.6s] Let me go over. Let me go over. I pray\n[753.1s] thee, I pray thee, take off his head.\n[755.0s] Let him take his\n[756.6s] head. He has nothing. Let me take his\n[760.0s] sword what is the head. What of\n[765.0s] you? Take his hand very fast.\n[770.0s] And the king said, the king said, \"What\n[771.8s] have I to do with you?\" You son of Zera,\n[774.7s] you son of So let him cast. Let him\n[777.9s] cast. Because the Lord has said unto\n[780.1s] him, said, \"Let him cast.\" Maybe the\n[782.7s] Lord has said unto him, unto him, cast\n[785.4s] David, cast David, who shall then say,\n[787.7s] who shall then say, wherefor thou done\n[789.8s] so?\n[792.0s] Imagine this man was abusing Saul David\n[797.8s] stones. Doing a lot and tell the\n[799.8s] soldiers, Mr. Allow me to go and chop\n[802.8s] his head off. Then he say, please allow\n[804.8s] him do that. allow him do who knows that\n[808.4s] is the Lord who has told him to do unto\n[812.0s] why David has done a lot of problems.\n[815.0s] His son at the same time has left with\n[817.7s] his what? as at the same time the his\n[821.0s] son is chasing\n[823.6s] him want to kill him at the same time in\n[827.4s] his arms the his son called who the one\n[831.4s] who raped the tama who I'm known as in\n[835.7s] the same family he had a lot of problems\n[839.1s] at the same time he has killed who\n[843.1s] and has taken the what and their first\n[845.4s] child is what dead\n[848.6s] So\n[851.7s] problems it is let's go to the next\n[856.1s] verse to do that somebody may do to you\n[859.5s] and you don't complain please let him do\n[862.3s] I've seen somebody\n[869.1s] saying we talking\n[876.0s] like you Have we ever had people when\n[878.7s] they being abused they say maybe God\n[881.0s] maybe it is my sins that is making me to\n[883.5s] be can we reach at a particular moment\n[886.2s] imagine in the church that when somebody\n[888.6s] talk about you say maybe God has ability\n[891.9s] him to do that maybe I should learn a\n[893.9s] lesson from what he's doing\n[896.8s] maybe this what David is saying don't do\n[899.9s] anything to him maybe it is the god who\n[903.4s] has allowed him to do that now let's go\n[905.5s] to next verse because of time And David\n[907.3s] said to Abishai, David said to his son\n[909.0s] and to all his servants, Yes. Behold,\n[911.2s] behold my son, my son, which came forth\n[913.5s] of my bowels, if my son have given birth\n[918.2s] to this one is coming from the family of\n[921.3s] my son given birth to\n[925.0s] seeketh my life.

My mother I think understands\n[950.3s] English because he went to school and I\n[953.5s] believe she understands. Those are the\n[955.8s] old women here over 50 and above.\n[973.0s] Have you ever system where your children\n[975.8s] your own home is against you?

Let let them do\n[999.0s] maybe God is the one doing\n[1001.6s] this. Maybe it is God. And imagine this\n[1005.0s] person is cursing a king who was\n[1008.9s] anointed\n[1010.0s] by Leave him alone. Don't kill him. So\n[1013.4s] Sime was to die. He's baptized. Sime was\n[1016.7s] to be what? But he is saying please\n[1020.1s] leave him. Why? It may be God who has\n[1023.4s] bidden me to do what? To do that to me.\n[1025.9s] To the right verse. I want to write very\n[1027.4s] fast. It may be that the Lord will look\n[1029.1s] on mine affliction. It may be the Lord\n[1031.5s] will look into my on my affliction. And\n[1034.2s] that the Lord will requit me. And the\n[1036.3s] Lord will requit me. Uhhuh. Good for his\n[1039.5s] cursing this day. The Lord will requit\n[1041.8s] me. Uhhuh. Good for cursing me this day.\n[1045.6s] Maybe the Lord will look on mine. What?\n[1047.8s] Let him just read. Maybe the Lord can\n[1050.4s] see. Maybe the Lord will look on my\n[1053.4s] word. I'm spiritual. The things I'm\n[1056.2s] passing through and the Lord may do what\n[1059.3s] requ\n[1070.8s] Can we have such people here in the\n[1072.9s] church of God? I don't know. Let that\n[1076.5s] continue very fast. And as David and his\n[1079.0s] men were by the way, she went along on\n[1082.0s] this hillside. She went along. He did\n[1084.6s] not stop. He went along on the hillside.\n[1087.6s] On the hillside over against\n[1102.9s] him\n[1104.5s] again. And as he went,\n[1111.6s] and threw stones at him. He was stere\n[1115.0s] and cast dust\n[1117.3s] dust and the king and the king and all\n[1120.6s] the people that were with him were\n[1122.7s] became weary came weary and refresh\n[1125.4s] themselves there weary do you know\n[1129.3s] abusing do you know how cursing do you\n[1132.4s] know talking he about people makes\n[1135.1s] people tired do you know today we are in\n[1138.2s] wives whereby women are tired because of\n[1141.1s] how the husbands talk about that. Do you\n[1144.0s] know we have people today in the church\n[1146.0s] they are because\n[1147.9s] of\n[1149.4s] criticisms condemnation one what made\n[1153.3s] them to be weary that\n[1156.4s] they refuses the throwing of\n[1159.7s] strokes there so\n[1162.5s] much then the Bible says\n[1167.0s] that all the people that the men of\n[1168.9s] Israel came to\n[1171.2s] Jerusalem with I will not go to because\n[1174.0s] I talked about last summer. I wanted you\n[1176.9s] wanted to see how was to be\n[1180.9s] killed. David says please leave S alone.\n[1185.4s] Leave him. Leave him alone.\n[1190.2s] Maybe\n[1192.8s] there does nothing to that. He leaves\n[1196.3s] him to live. And then Solomon came to\n[1199.8s] take the\n[1201.7s] kingship.\n[1204.2s] 36 came very well what this man did to\n[1208.1s] his father. He knew if you say that\n[1212.9s] therefore he come upon you from the\n[1216.9s] verse\n[1218.4s] 31 to him do fall upon him and burn him.\n[1223.1s] The Lord shall return his blood upon\n[1225.0s] him. You can read it. I'm not going to\n[1227.3s] read that. And then verse 35, the\n[1230.7s] king\n[1233.2s] of the priest and did the king in the\n[1236.2s] room of Abiata. And then verse 36. And\n[1238.9s] the king said and called she and said\n[1240.8s] unto him, \"Build me a house in Jerusalem\n[1244.2s] and dwell there and go not for it shall\n[1247.7s] be from that day thou going out and\n[1250.2s] passes over and thou shall know for that\n[1256.5s] what the king saying is the gold is gold\n[1264.2s] what?\"\n[1265.2s] graces. Imagine some of there are people\n[1269.7s] even in this room that do not talk with\n[1272.0s] some people because they sin that was\n[1274.0s] done to them long time ago. Maybe 10\n[1276.5s] years ago they not talking they in the\n[1278.8s] church of God. There are people here who\n[1281.3s] are not talking to others because others\n[1283.3s] are wrong with their parents and they in\n[1285.4s] the church of God preaching what we got\n[1288.0s] faith. Look at this man, the spirit of\n[1290.9s] David. Spirit of his son and build an\n[1294.3s] house in where? Jerusalem. The day you\n[1296.7s] will go any\n[1302.8s] good. And my lord the king say\n[1309.1s] what is what?\n[1311.6s] Thank you so much. And they dwell in\n[1313.9s] Jerusalem for many what? Many days. For\n[1316.0s] many what days. Please read with me\n[1318.2s] verse 38. He looked in Jerusalem for\n[1320.8s] many days. Many days. And it came to\n[1324.0s] pass. It came to pass at the end of\n[1325.9s] three years. After he stayed after how\n[1328.4s] many years? Three years. After how many\n[1330.3s] years? Three years. Remember in the\n[1331.7s] Jewish economy 3 years when somebody has\n[1334.6s] taken the service in the service of God\n[1336.7s] he was to be ordained among the wildes\n[1340.0s] and the Jewish 3 years was somebody to\n[1342.5s] stay in the hard cities when he was to\n[1344.8s] be given a responsibility of taking a\n[1347.4s] particular\n[1348.6s] church. The same with the pioneers it\n[1351.1s] was 3 years look this man stayed three\n[1354.2s] what? three years.\n[1357.3s] And it came to pass at the end of three\n[1358.9s] years to pass three years that the two\n[1362.2s] of the servants of\n[1363.6s] Shime unto Akish\n[1367.0s] unto Akish, the son of Maka, king of G.\n[1371.2s] And they told Shimeme,\n[1373.4s] saying, \"Thy servant be in G. Thy\n[1376.6s] servant be G.\" Uh-huh. And she arose.\n[1380.1s] She rose and suddenly suddenly and went\n[1383.0s] to God. to G to Akish his servant and\n[1386.4s] Shme went and brought his servant from G\n[1389.4s] and it was told Solomon that Shme had\n[1391.8s] gone from Jerusalem to G to G and was\n[1394.2s] come again imagine he went came again he\n[1398.2s] went and died out he went out and he\n[1401.9s] came\n[1404.4s] back things that people do not know he\n[1411.2s] went he thinks that Solomon do not know\n[1413.8s] anywhere and he was told please be do\n[1416.5s] not come out of where Jerusalem he\n[1421.0s] went please your other side and what did\n[1424.2s] he do went and brought went himself very\n[1426.2s] fast broke come back very fast and when\n[1428.7s] he came he didn't know his provision is\n[1430.4s] what it's closed closed he was given a\n[1433.6s] chance again imagine if you read let's\n[1436.5s] go to verse number 41 it says yes and it\n[1439.9s] was told Solomon told that she had gone\n[1442.6s] from Jerusalem to God. From Jerusalem to\n[1444.8s] God, and was come again. Was come again.\n[1446.7s] And the king sent and called for Shib\n[1448.4s] was called was called and said unto him\n[1450.5s] said unto him, did I not make thee to\n[1452.2s] swear by the Lord? I made you to swear\n[1454.2s] before the Lord and protest unto thee,\n[1456.6s] say, know for a certain on the day that\n[1459.5s] thou goest out, and walkest abroad by\n[1462.0s] hither, yes, that thou shalt surely die.\n[1464.1s] Thou shalt surely die. Thou said unto\n[1465.7s] me, said unto me, the word that heard is\n[1468.2s] good. The word that heard is is good. Is\n[1472.1s] that how we also say when you have\n[1473.4s] accepted the truth it is good the\n[1476.2s] message is good I will walk in the way\n[1480.1s] we thank\n[1481.3s] God and even promise it is what can you\n[1485.7s] remember our baptism of vows when we\n[1487.4s] make vow with God you read that and then\n[1491.0s] people say it is\n[1492.7s] what verse number 42 42 I've read verse\n[1496.9s] 43 why then hast thou not kept the oath\n[1499.8s] of the lord why have you not kept the\n[1501.7s] vows you made and the commandment that I\n[1504.2s] have charged thee with. 44. The king\n[1507.3s] said moreover to Sheime. Listen to this\n[1509.6s] verse says the king said moreover to\n[1512.6s] Shme, thou knowest all the wickedness\n[1515.4s] which thine heart is private to that\n[1517.9s] thou didest to David my father. You\n[1519.9s] remember what he did to his father? He\n[1522.3s] abused the father of David. He was to\n[1524.4s] die. But this me was not to live. See me\n[1528.2s] he said was to be jumped once. Oh, but\n[1530.5s] what happened? Was given probation time.\n[1533.6s] David was so much gracious. I'm\n[1535.8s] wondering about David. David was so much\n[1538.6s] That is why God says David's heart is\n[1541.7s] after his own heart. You know what you\n[1544.6s] did to my world. Thou knowest all the\n[1546.7s] wickedness which thine heart is private\n[1548.5s] to. Yes. That thou didest to David my\n[1551.1s] father. Yes. Therefore the Lord shall\n[1553.1s] return thy weakness upon thy own head.\n[1555.3s] Yes. And King Solomon shall be blessed.\n[1558.0s] Shall be blessed. The throne of David\n[1559.6s] shall be established before the Lord\n[1561.0s] forever. Amen. So the king commanded\n[1563.0s] Baniah the son of Jodia which went out\n[1567.1s] and fell upon it that he died and the\n[1570.2s] kingdom was established in the heart of\n[1571.8s] Solomon. The kingdom of Solomon was\n[1574.1s] established.\n[1575.8s] Amen.\n[1579.4s] Grace of a loving God. Praise the\n[1591.5s] tit mountain out for the way the blood\n[1597.2s] of the lamb was\n[1606.1s] plead\n[1608.7s] gra and\n[1612.9s] and\n[1621.3s] grad\n[1625.1s] all surely\n[1628.6s] s was not to leave. S did wickedness was\n[1633.9s] to be chopped\n[1635.8s] longtime. Sime was not to leave. Do you\n[1638.6s] think even even you look at was he again\n[1641.4s] live again next to David's\n[1643.6s] son he was unworthy but he was given\n[1647.4s] infinite\n[1650.0s] grace. In fact he was even brought to\n[1653.0s] live in Jerusalem not to go anywhere\n[1656.8s] again. He was to leave. He was told he\n[1660.1s] even\n[1667.6s] swel in fact Solomon was not even to\n[1670.8s] talk with this. Do you have you ever\n[1672.6s] been you know there are things which are\n[1674.6s] so sad?\n[1676.4s] Have you ever been in a family and you\n[1678.1s] see somebody abusing your your\n[1680.5s] mother you abuse and talking about you\n[1685.0s] you have you ever seen or your father\n[1686.7s] somebody come and your father in front\n[1688.2s] of you and you big\n[1690.0s] people is it so sad I don't unless you\n[1693.0s] are\n[1694.0s] man slap that mouth of that boy hardly\n[1698.9s] so that he may be able to wake up sit\n[1701.5s] well you are sitting apparate as well\n[1704.3s] amen\n[1706.8s] Now somebody abusing your father or\n[1709.2s] somebody come and beat your mother in\n[1710.6s] your presence. How do you feel? You'll\n[1713.4s] feel how will you feel that somebody\n[1716.2s] slap your mother and kick and you're\n[1717.5s] sitting down and you're big people that\n[1719.7s] person's pricking and then following one\n[1721.7s] year you find that person who kicked\n[1723.5s] your mother they there staying together\n[1725.1s] in the same house and how will you\n[1730.6s] feel it is so\n[1732.9s] sad imagine this man is now living with\n[1736.4s] Solomon Solomon gives him another chance\n[1739.3s] and then later on he breaks went out to\n[1742.9s] the world, comes back to Jerusalem.\n[1745.2s] Remember Jerusalem represent what? The\n[1747.2s] house of God. The house of God. Is that\n[1748.8s] right? Yes. Where God's act of covenant\n[1751.3s] was found. He runs and then comes back\n[1754.0s] again. And when he comes back, his grace\n[1756.9s] is what? Over. Grace is now over.\n[1760.2s] Proverbial is\n[1762.4s] closed. I'm taking another case study\n[1764.6s] and then I pray because my time is\n[1767.0s] almost up. Acts 12 verse 25. There's\n[1770.7s] another man. Bible reads who also went\n[1773.6s] and I I want to tell you that some of us\n[1776.2s] may be taking examples in this last days\n[1778.9s] we can with the vows we are making to\n[1781.4s] work for God you sometimes we can make\n[1784.3s] vibes we don't understand sometimes we\n[1787.0s] entering upon the and\n[1789.2s] that's me young people have made\n[1792.0s] decisions and they think they\n[1795.1s] making they do not\n[1798.1s] understand some people even gone from\n[1800.4s] baptism they don't understand and that\n[1803.4s] is why we are tired jokes and ced and\n[1807.0s] are falling upon some even given\n[1809.5s] themselves on things they do not\n[1811.2s] understand so that when other things\n[1814.4s] come when other messengers bring them\n[1816.2s] some messages please run over there run\n[1818.8s] over there and then they can run there\n[1821.0s] and after some time come back anytime\n[1824.0s] they want and they think that they are\n[1825.8s] still\n[1828.6s] They did and they made vow they think\n[1832.2s] that they making vow to man and not to\n[1834.6s] God. Hallelujah. And this is thought it\n[1838.1s] is a joke. He did not know how\n[1840.5s] wickedness he was. He did not know that\n[1843.4s] he only got grace. And that is why many\n[1846.1s] young people today do not know that this\n[1848.8s] song we are making, the vibes we are\n[1850.8s] making as we speak in this last days,\n[1853.5s] they do not know it is the last\n[1856.4s] chance that we just been given and they\n[1860.3s] are choosing so and so did this, so and\n[1863.3s] so did this. But let me tell you, you\n[1865.5s] may go and you going that was your final\n[1869.4s] chance. Hallelujah. Acts 12 verse 25.\n[1875.4s] Barnabas again. Let's take another case\n[1877.9s] study before we pray. Read Acts 12 verse\n[1882.1s] number 25. The Bible says and Barnabas\n[1884.6s] and Saul returned from Jerusalem.\n[1886.4s] Barnabas and Saul returned from\n[1889.0s] Jerusalem. They had filled their\n[1890.7s] ministry. that what filled their\n[1894.1s] ministry that fulfilled their ministry\n[1897.7s] ministry\n[1899.3s] and took with them John with them a man\n[1902.2s] called who John John whose son name was\n[1904.8s] Mark whose son name was Mark so his name\n[1906.9s] was John Mark who took him and they were\n[1911.3s] preaching they found a man they found\n[1913.9s] what and man his name was called who\n[1916.9s] John\n[1919.7s] chapter 13 Verse number 13, the Bible\n[1922.7s] reads, \"Now when Paul and his company\n[1925.0s] lose from Puffos, now when Paul and his\n[1928.4s] what? His company loosed from Pos, they\n[1932.3s] came to Pa. They came to Pah in Pilia.\n[1936.6s] And John departing from them. John\n[1939.1s] departed from them\n[1942.4s] in fact. These verses have taken me to\n[1945.6s] not be praying. Act\n[1948.8s] 12. Saul and who? And Barnabas took who?\n[1952.9s] John Mark in their minist. They took him\n[1956.1s] so that this man may join them in the\n[1957.9s] work of God. In Acts 13, the Bible\n[1960.6s] simply says who departed. Now when Paul\n[1963.0s] and his family come loose from Paposh,\n[1964.9s] they came to P and Pilia and John\n[1967.5s] departed from them to return to\n[1969.4s] Jerusalem. John departed. He left the\n[1971.7s] two men and departed from where?\n[1974.4s] Jerusalem. Jun went to Jerusalem. He\n[1977.1s] departed and left. Let's go very fast\n[1985.2s] 169. I'm remaining with two and we pray.\n[1989.8s] Read this one. Write them\n[1995.3s] down.\n[1996.8s] 169 it reads was not a man of\n[2001.8s] education. I've said\n[2006.0s] 69. Yes. Yes.\n[2008.6s] I want people to see there somebody\n[2010.5s] doing it\n[2012.3s] very was not a man of education. Yes.\n[2015.0s] Yet he was paragraph paragraph two.

As\n[2227.5s] faithful shepherds, as faithful\n[2229.1s] shepherds, in search of the lost sheep,\n[2231.0s] in search of the lost sheep, they gave\n[2232.4s] no thought to their own ease and\n[2233.9s] convenience.

Amen. Those were the men\n[2321.9s] that were\n[2323.3s] called. But as they were doing that\n[2326.1s] work, Mark joined them. But look here,\n[2330.1s] it was here that Mark, it was\n[2333.0s] overwhelmed with fear and\n[2334.2s] discouragement.\n[2336.6s] When there was no food, people are Hey,\n[2339.8s] please look here. It was here that there\n[2341.6s] was opposition, there was weariness,\n[2346.0s] privation,\n[2347.8s] cold, coldness, no enough clothes,\n[2350.1s] hunger. It was here that Mark, please,\n[2353.6s] those who are not reading, read loudly\n[2355.5s] with me. It was Mark over overwhelmed\n[2359.0s] with fear discouragement wavered for a\n[2363.6s] time wavered for what a time in his\n[2367.0s] purpose to give himself wholehearted to\n[2368.8s] the Lord's work said I cannot be a\n[2370.6s] full-time\n[2373.0s] minist I\n[2376.0s] fear it is possible it is not possible\n[2379.6s] for me it is\n[2381.2s] impossible for a time you know look look\n[2383.8s] at that quotation\n[2385.5s] You see what did she do? She\n[2391.8s] say check with me. Check what also Mark\n[2394.8s] is saying here. Read again. It was here.\n[2397.4s] Look at who? Please look here. He said\n[2399.2s] it was here that Mark It was here that\n[2401.3s] Mark overwhelmed with fear and\n[2402.6s] discouragement. Discouragement wavered\n[2405.2s] for a time. Wavered for a time in his\n[2407.7s] purpose to give himself to the Lord. for\n[2410.1s] a means\n[2412.1s] he give himself for a means\n[2415.1s] or something he will later on he may\n[2417.9s] give himself what wholeheartedly oh\n[2420.7s] really it was here that Mark it was\n[2424.3s] overwhelmed with fear and discouragement\n[2425.8s] overwhelmed and feel discouraged wavered\n[2427.8s] for a time for a time his purpose to\n[2430.0s] give himself hearted to the world's work\n[2432.7s] and used to hardship and he used to\n[2435.0s] hardship hardship he was disheartened he\n[2437.7s] was disheartened by the perils Privation\n[2440.1s] of the way they're used to what\n[2441.8s] privations of the wives what hardship I\n[2444.8s] I I want to know the mother of mark I\n[2447.1s] don't you know\n[2448.9s] hardship please children teach these\n[2451.7s] children and I thank my father and my\n[2454.4s] mother here my mother is here I thank\n[2456.0s] them with us when I look at our life at\n[2458.4s] home it was life of hardship\n[2460.7s] amenship I remember when we were young\n[2463.1s] we had only two benches in our\n[2482.7s] Amen. With my\n[2488.0s] sisters, this young man, my brother, we\n[2491.3s] were\n[2493.1s] working in fact\n[2495.8s] My mother is here.\n[2525.4s] hours by\n[2532.0s] 2000 brothers.\n[2544.6s] brothers. Now you have big brothers.\n[2546.7s] They were in class 8 and I was in class\n[2549.3s] one. Life of good. Amen. Amen. I didn't\n[2553.8s] know that that was preparing me for the\n[2555.6s] gospel work. Let me tell you those make\n[2557.5s] decision. This gospel work is very\n[2559.6s] difficult. Amen. Amen. That those are\n[2573.9s] used. I remember when I was going to\n[2576.4s] high school, I cried to the mother and\n[2577.9s] the mother used to tell me, \"You are\n[2579.1s] with your father working for the whole\n[2580.7s] day. What did you do to\n[2587.2s] me? Go back. You are there.\n[2591.3s] And then we go to school\n[2593.1s] without. So what did we do when we go to\n[2598.0s] school in the\n[2602.9s] bathroom? In fact, when it is 3\n[2606.5s] weeks for people to\n[2610.6s] close\n[2613.1s] because you know when people and then by\n[2616.4s] the end of the time I remember I went to\n[2619.0s] school with not given pocket\n[2625.2s] money. What I was doing I eat it that\n[2628.4s] day so that I may not think something\n[2630.8s] over the box. I study in class. Life of\n[2634.1s] what? And whom that life was preparing\n[2637.4s] because this gospel that you want to\n[2639.5s] make decision is life for. No, there are\n[2642.0s] things that we pass and sometimes you\n[2644.6s] can hate your parents but later on when\n[2646.5s] you sit down you read Romans 8:28 then\n[2649.0s] you say all things work together for\n[2651.4s] good for those who love God and are\n[2653.4s] called to his purpose. Hallelujah.\n[2655.9s] Praise God. And used to what? Hardship.\n[2660.0s] Hardship. They were using in good house\n[2663.2s] electricity mopping with this gospel but\n[2667.0s] God still calls them. Why don't you say\n[2668.6s] amen?\n[2670.2s] Let's read. I'm almost finishing. And he\n[2672.2s] used to worship and used to worship. He\n[2673.8s] was disheartened by the privilege and\n[2675.6s] privation of the way. He had labored\n[2677.9s] with success. He had leed with success\n[2680.0s] unfavorable circumstances. Unfavor. So\n[2682.4s] those are used toward they can labor\n[2684.6s] with success in favorable circumstances.\n[2687.3s] when there's something they get there's\n[2689.0s] food there's brown rice chapel there's\n[2692.9s] fair oh that is favorable war\n[2695.2s] circumstance but now a minister of\n[2698.8s] position a minister what opposition\n[2702.4s] was too much and perils and perils that\n[2705.6s] so often beset the pioneer work that so\n[2708.9s] what often beset the pioneer work God is\n[2712.5s] calling us to a pioneer work we are\n[2714.9s] going back to the old ACD\n[2717.6s] to the faith of the adventist which all\n[2720.5s] charges our general depart from the\n[2723.8s] truth. This is the time we were\n[2726.6s] establishing the Christian world church.\n[2729.3s] We also called in the same work going\n[2731.4s] back to the old ways. It is very\n[2733.8s] difficult for those who will be coming\n[2735.6s] forward. I've been preaching here and\n[2737.4s] men and young ladies are coming forward.\n[2739.6s] that a time cometh that there's not even\n[2742.0s] shoes. A time cometh that you may not\n[2745.4s] have even clothes. A time reaches that\n[2748.3s] when you have a coat and they try new\n[2750.8s] one which somebody has given you. Some\n[2752.6s] people think that maybe maybe nowadays\n[2755.1s] they saw where you get things. It is\n[2757.6s] very if you don't have you are poor go\n[2759.8s] and do something. If you are this one\n[2762.0s] you might have stolen somewhere. It is\n[2764.5s] very difficult. Hallelujah church.\n[2767.0s] Hallelujah. It is very difficult that\n[2770.4s] sometimes you cannot even get money to\n[2773.9s] save your air. Very\n[2777.2s] difficult. But we are told that at such\n[2780.2s] a time is when Mark says it is not\n[2783.5s] possible. I'm going back. Cannot do\n[2785.8s] that. Read. Read with me very fast. He\n[2788.1s] felt he knew hardness as a good soldier\n[2789.8s] of the cross.\n[2792.0s] Good soldier of the cross. He had yet to\n[2793.9s] learn to face danger. He had yet to\n[2796.3s] learn to face danger and persecution and\n[2799.0s] persecution. Adversity with a brave\n[2800.8s] heart. Adversity with a brave heart.\n[2803.4s] Adverse with a brave heart. As the\n[2805.4s] apostle advanced as the apostle advanced\n[2807.5s] and still great difficulties were\n[2809.0s] apprehended. Yes. Mark was intimidated.\n[2811.9s] Mark was intimidated and losing all\n[2814.6s] courage and losing all courage. Refused\n[2816.9s] to go further and return to Jerusalem.\n[2818.4s] He said, \"I'm not going with this. This\n[2820.0s] is not a gospel. Gospel with\n[2822.2s] persecution.\n[2825.9s] You know this gospel sometimes very\n[2827.7s] difficult that there are things you may\n[2829.1s] be going through that you don't even\n[2830.9s] want your brothers to\n[2832.4s] know. This gospel is very tough that\n[2835.0s] sometimes you can cry in a\n[2837.2s] cell. Sometimes it is tough that you\n[2840.9s] even don't know how to\n[2843.4s] start. Sometimes things are so tough\n[2846.1s] that you sit somewhere and say how do I\n[2848.2s] start these things? It is very\n[2850.2s] difficult. At that time his Wendy and\n[2852.3s] Mark said this thing Paul and Barabas is\n[2854.3s] doing and every time they trust in God I\n[2856.6s] was reading about Joseph B when the wife\n[2858.4s] call and ask him give us money for food\n[2860.7s] and the answer was God will provide. You\n[2862.9s] said we are tired with God. Every time\n[2864.4s] we\n[2865.2s] provide that every time we have why can\n[2868.6s] we go to the last quotation conflict and\n[2872.0s] courage this the last one 348 paragraph\n[2876.5s] 2 and three and then you jump to 349 and\n[2879.5s] then we pray. Please friends youth must\n[2883.3s] decide for himself but which decision.\n[2885.1s] Do you understand the decision you are\n[2886.5s] making? Did Mark understand? Mark\n[2888.9s] entered the gospel without understanding\n[2891.0s] the obligation. S was also making an\n[2894.1s] obligation without understanding and\n[2897.0s] please do not get opportunity. We want\n[2899.6s] also see this one. Read with me. Mark\n[2903.1s] bring him with you for he find him\n[2905.7s] useful. That is second Timothy what?\n[2908.7s] Mark's what? Mark's mother was a convert\n[2910.6s] to the Christian religion. Christian\n[2912.2s] religion. Mark's mother was a convert.\n[2919.9s] backh and what and home Jerusalem\n[2924.5s] Jerusalem is an asylum to the disciples.\n[2926.9s] Hallelujah. Amen. So Mark Mark's\n[2930.2s] mother's house was an isel. All\n[2933.7s] preachers used to go to\n[2935.8s] mother's Mark's home. I love the mothers\n[2938.6s] of\n[2939.7s] Mark. Mark's mother was a good mother.\n[2942.2s] What do you say man? There are mothers\n[2944.6s] here that you cannot go to their\n[2949.6s] homes. My mother thank you did not ask\n[2952.1s] me such question when ministers used to\n[2955.3s] come to our\n[2957.5s] home. This woman was very good. Amen.\n[2960.2s] Amen. Can God give us this other mother.\n[2962.2s] So there are mothers if we go to their\n[2966.4s] home. Amen. Hallelujah.\n[2970.6s] Ma and you know how ministers when they\n[2972.6s] get a place they can go, they will go.\n[2974.4s] Amen. I I think this mother was\n[2976.7s] peaceful. Mark's mother was a convert to\n[2980.2s] the Christian religion. Amen. At home at\n[2983.3s] Jerusalem was an assam for the\n[2987.3s] Mark proposed\n[2988.8s] to Mark was there seeing how the mother\n[2991.5s] was welcoming. Then Mark was touring\n[2993.6s] with ministers in the table and he said\n[2995.9s] to Paul and he said that he should\n[2999.0s] accompany them on their missionary tour\n[3001.2s] go with you the missionary tour. He has\n[3003.8s] proposed he not understand and that is\n[3006.2s] the problem today with men who enter\n[3008.8s] into the ministry without understanding\n[3010.9s] the obligation. They don't understand.\n[3013.0s] That is why we can enter any we want and\n[3015.2s] leave anytime we want. We don't\n[3016.8s] understand. We just love going to miss.\n[3018.9s] People are going to miss. Can we go? Can\n[3020.8s] we go? Oh, you're the minister. Let us\n[3022.6s] go. Now, when things become difficult,\n[3025.2s] when you are taking one year with one\n[3027.0s] sweater, you say, \"Oh, I thought I'm\n[3030.0s] going to be like a district.\n[3041.6s] There are people here. There are\n[3043.5s] ministers. They are just proposing. Can\n[3045.2s] we go in a few\n[3047.6s] minutes? We need to help our parents. We\n[3050.1s] need to Mark also\n[3055.1s] proposed to Paul and Barnabas. Yes. That\n[3057.8s] he should accompany them on their\n[3059.0s] missionary tour. He felt the favor of\n[3061.1s] God in his heart and long to devote\n[3063.6s] himself entirely to the work of the\n[3064.9s] gospel. To be to be a fulltime what?\n[3068.4s] Minister. Young man, how many are\n[3070.2s] longing to be full-time ministers? You\n[3072.7s] are longing. We thank God. Longing. I\n[3076.6s] want to give my life entirely to the\n[3078.6s] gospel. You think it is a\n[3080.8s] joke. Ask those who have tried it here.\n[3083.5s] It is not a joke. Ask their mothers. My\n[3086.2s] mother is here. Go with him. Ask is\n[3087.9s] Maxwell sending you something per month.\n[3090.1s] He will tell\n[3095.2s] you. Amen. Hallelujah.\n[3099.0s] That's what\n[3100.6s] difficult. Some people do not understand\n[3103.5s] it. So it was just longing. Now look\n[3106.9s] after longing. Their way was to\n[3111.2s] they encountered hardship. They\n[3112.7s] encountered hardship and privation\n[3115.5s] and were beset with das on\n[3118.0s] every but Paul and Barnabas\n[3121.4s] in learn to trust God's heart.\n[3124.5s] Their hearts were filled with fervent\n[3126.0s] love for perishing spirit. A shful\n[3128.9s] shepherd in search of the lost sheep.\n[3131.7s] They gave thought to their own ease and\n[3134.0s] conveniences. ease and what?\n[3135.8s] Conveniences. Forgetful of self. They\n[3139.1s] faltered not when merry not when weary\n[3142.0s] when weary hungry hungry and called they\n[3144.9s] had in their view but one object.\n[3147.1s] Salvation of those who had wondered far\n[3148.8s] from the\n[3150.3s] fall. Please imagine we had a people\n[3152.9s] with one object. You know nowadays\n[3154.9s] people come to the ministry with se\n[3157.3s] several objects. Somebody come to the\n[3159.4s] ministry and gives the church the list.\n[3161.8s] When I've come to minister you know my\n[3163.8s] mother you have to build a house for him\n[3165.8s] for her. You know yeah you will be close\n[3169.2s] my mother you know you buy buy for me a\n[3171.6s] land in the country you must build for\n[3173.5s] me. I say I'm preaching for\n[3175.2s] you. So those list if you will fulfill\n[3177.9s] them we can go and preach. No, but with\n[3181.4s] these people they had one what? Object.\n[3183.9s] What? What was the object? What? They\n[3186.4s] the they had view but one object.\n[3188.5s] Salvation. Those who were worried one\n[3190.7s] far from the fall. Next point. Mark will\n[3194.3s] be fear and discouragement and\n[3196.0s] discouragement wavered for a time in his\n[3198.6s] for a time in his purpose purpose to\n[3201.7s] give himself wholehearted Lord's word\n[3204.5s] and he used to worship and he used to\n[3206.6s] worship. He was disheartened by the\n[3208.2s] perish and prevision of the way. He had\n[3210.6s] yet to learn to face danger and\n[3212.8s] persecution, adversity with a brave\n[3215.2s] heart. As the apostle advanced and still\n[3218.2s] great difficulties were apprehended,\n[3220.3s] Mark was intimidated. And losing all\n[3223.2s] courage, refused to go further and\n[3225.2s] return to Jerusalem. This decision\n[3227.5s] caused Paul to judge Mark unfavorably.\n[3229.8s] Mark judged Paul. Paul judged Mark\n[3232.6s] unfavorably.\n[3234.6s] Unfavorably. is not like David. Paul is\n[3238.2s] not like what? David. Paul judged Mark\n[3241.2s] what? Unfavorably. Imagine the one who\n[3243.8s] was not judged like was not judge\n[3245.6s] unfavorable. David said, \"Please leave\n[3247.6s] him. Please leave him.\"\n[3253.3s] But look what did Paul do? The decision\n[3255.9s] caused Paul to judge unfavorably.\n[3258.4s] Unfavorably. And even severely. That one\n[3261.0s] thing is 15 we are not going to read.\n[3263.0s] And he judged him severely. He\n[3266.5s] refused because now people were going\n[3272.1s] back and when Mark came people said Mark\n[3274.8s] is joking. Mark is joking. Mark cannot\n[3277.4s] leave us in the field and then go and\n[3279.2s] rest when things were tough and then\n[3280.9s] when things are\n[3283.0s] new with people we cannot work with\n[3286.1s] there people in ministry talking like\n[3287.8s] that. So and so has been leaving us and\n[3289.7s] coming this time\n[3291.7s] around. Hallelujah.\n[3294.9s] Hallelujah. Mark judged that Paul judged\n[3297.8s] Mark. Paul judged Mark unfavorable\n[3301.4s] and even severe injuries they were fight\n[3304.9s] they were almost\n[3307.1s] fighting there was sharp contention in\n[3309.4s] Acts 15:36 sharp\n[3313.5s] contention Paul was\n[3317.1s] mistaken what he said is final people\n[3320.5s] love Paul but Paul had\n[3325.2s] something till people separated\n[3328.9s] And then for a\n[3567.0s] Some people are going to come back\n[3568.3s] because somebody do not want them. Look,\n[3570.5s] Mark did not think of what Paul is\n[3572.5s] thinking about him. But we told that\n[3574.2s] Barnabas has encouraged him. Don't we\n[3576.5s] have Barnabas today here who is able to\n[3579.7s] encourage young men to keep the faith?\n[3582.4s] Yes, we have. Don't we have also people\n[3584.7s] like Paul who thinks that others should\n[3587.0s] not be given opportunity? Yes, they are\n[3589.0s] there. They were there with during the\n[3590.6s] time of who of of of David. There was\n[3593.1s] one who said, \"Can we chop his head\n[3594.5s] off?\" What's that?\n[3596.6s] Abishai. Abby. Don't we have also with\n[3599.8s] the spirit of Paul? But still there was\n[3602.1s] grace. In both there was grace both for\n[3605.0s] and for who? John Mark. How are you\n[3607.0s] going to use that grace? Friends, the\n[3609.4s] work is great and the youth must decide\n[3611.4s] for themselves. Please, the messages\n[3613.1s] we're bringing on to you are hard. The\n[3615.4s] messages that being presented by\n[3617.2s] ministers there are hard they are notice\n[3620.4s] and sometimes when you see people making\n[3622.4s] decisions in this church it is not simp\n[3625.6s] this faith is very hard for you to\n[3628.2s] preach there are lot of things waiting\n[3630.2s] for us it needs those who are going to\n[3633.0s] give themselves\n[3634.7s] unreservedly not with what feelings and\n[3638.5s] those are the people God is calling\n[3639.8s] friends hallelujah and the youth\n[3642.6s] mass and there's a grace if If you get\n[3645.2s] lost, it will be up. But if this anybody\n[3649.0s] will get lost with this opportunity we\n[3651.4s] have gotten, your blood will be upon\n[3654.2s] thee.

And then\n[3675.7s] we just simply neglect these messages.\n[3678.3s] Please when we get lost, we are going to\n[3680.2s] be killed. Sime is being killed in the\n[3682.9s] presence of Solomon. Ben is taking his\n[3685.7s] tool and is being slaughtered. And then\n[3688.2s] he told your\n[3690.0s] blood thee with all those grace.

For this is my humble prayer by faith in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. So uh welcome again to this presentation. We are at the point where we are studying about the skills that papers had to use to overthrow Protestantism. Louis saw that during that time in the Geneva after the truth had been published in that city a pro a protestant worship was established. And uh when this protestant worship was established, we are told that papacy was not happy with protestantism going on. Therefore, even in this last days after the truth has been has been preached, a protestantism worship has also be established and I told you that one thing one objective for the purposes is to overthrow Protestantism. We will get controversy by 234. We've realized that throughout let me repeat this quotation from the beginning. You can just help me read from the project so that all of us might get might get involved in this presentation. It it says it reads one. Uh let me let me this one should be one throughout throughout Christianom. Protestantism was by formidable force. Protestantism was by formidable force. Past triumph of information pass.

They are dead to the claims of natural affliction. Reason and concerns fall silence. Their results and concerns are to what? Silence. Silence. Hallelujah. Like in fact they work as papacy itself by the way do you know that papacy doesn't what change I remember when my brother Maxwell was presenting another day here he read a quotation where he said that robe never changes hallelujah that is the characteristics of that as I'm presenting this I remember another presentation during prophecy that there are how many things that must happen five things that must happen and one of things that there was death of whatantism. Then people shall view papacy in a positive what a positive view. So you need to understand that in the last days what must be destroyed. Then the papacy believe that is protestant protest. Don't protesting must be destroy destroyed. But the Bible says that the papacy is going to destroy these people skillfully and what? Wonderfully. Wonderfully. Continue reading. They knew no rule.

Hallelujah. Amen. We need to understand that the the the principles of Christianity allowed their adherence to do what? to suffer to uh the gospel of Christ had enabled its to meet danger and endure suffering and is made by call hunger toil and poverty to uphold the bar of the truth in the face in face of the rock the dion and the and the stake to combat this process jud inspired its followers withism that enabled them to endure the like What?

Jesus can even come to the meeting and sit together with you. Hallelujah. And when you will bearing those who are going to comment after less can carry up their comment. Hallelujah. But that great order is to destroy what roantantism and all the weapons of deception are going to be established. It continues by saying that B to perpetual what? Poverty and humility. It was their studied aim to secure wealth and power to be devoted to the overthrow of what? Protestantism and to reestablish the purpose of popular what? Supremacy. Hallelujah. So the order of Jesuits what Jesuits are working for is to overthrow what? Protestantism and establish what? Supremacy. Do you know that papacy knows very well that when protestantism increases then their power is going to do what? Decrease. Great controversy 39 will tell you that when these people continue preaching they shall be burning their own altars. Are we together? If protesters continue to preach, they are going to burn the altars of papacy. Are we together? So we are told that while appearing as a member of their council, I want that to be projected with this electricity. Amen. Selen proceed that one is coming. I'm still in great controversy page 235 paragraph one. This is the last thing I'm reading in great controversy. Then after that I'm going to read something in a book called Christian studies on Christian education. Then by the end of that I'll be able to end my presentation. It continues by saying while appearing, are you able to read? Proceed. While appearing as the members of their order, while Jesus appearing at the members of their order, they wore a g of sanctity.

Yes, he cared. Did he care for the sick? Absolutely he cared. Hallelujah. So Jesus are also doing the same the same. But next statement says continue. But under this blameless exterior, under this blameless exterior, most criminal and deadly purposes, criminal and deadly what purposes were were often done what? Concealed. It was the fundamental principle of the order that the end justifies the what the means. Hallelujah. Jesus know very well that if you want to accomplish something, what you want to accomplish will be showing you what to do at the present state. Are we together? Just talk to me. the electricity. So I want to get encouraged. I'm soon finishing this presentation. Hallelujah. So we are told that it is their principle that the order that the end justifies the means. By this code, which the end justifies the what? The means. By this code, lying, theft, assassination were not only various this guy uh were not only pardonable but com commendable. When they serve the interest of the the church and various disguise the Jesus worked their way into offices of what state. Are we together? They work their way into the office of the the state. So who are advising R today? Jesuits. Are we together? Who are advising other presidents? The Jesuits just say because that is what the testimony says. They make their way into the office of what? of the states climbing up to the counselors to to be counselors of what kings and shaping the policies of the what so shaping the policies of Kenya just hallelujah so even when people are fighting over finance bill know that the issues has shaped the policies of of Kenya but get this they became servants to act as spies upon their what their master and what did they They established what?

So when he want to deal with the church then he established what colleges for the those who have money are we together those who have money for those who don't have money schools are establish then they take their what their children are we together that is purpose and I'm talking about purple system of what education but I need to know in your mind that there's another kind of what education hallelujah I want to get I want you to get me right so this is the establish colleges for the sons of the princes and no nobles and schools for the common what the common people and we are told that the children of protesters were drawn into an observance of poish what rights all the outward pump and display of romanish worship was brought to bear to confuse the mind and dazzle and captivate the imagination and that's the liberty for which the fathers had toiled and bled was betrayed by the what? The sons. The Jews rapidly spread themselves over what? Europe. And wherever they went, they followed a revival of what? Pop. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So we are told that while they me, they visit what? Prisons and do what? Visit oceptals. Then they care for the po the poor. Then they establish what? Colleges and school and school. And this quotation says that where they went what followed a revival of what? Popery. Hallelujah. And we are told that the liberty that the father toiled was betrayed by the son the sons. So that is how to destroy what? Protestantism. Hallelujah. If you want to destroy protestants, you just use their what? Their children. Are we together? So fathers are toiling for liberty. Then the children's betray are we together. So that is what they are doing. Hallelujah. Let me finish. Studies on Christian education. Studies on Christian education. Studies on Christian education. Let me read this page as I am coming to the end of my presentation so that we might have social meeting. I wish electricity will be there so that this one be projected. Studies on Christian education. Let me read this page. I'm giving you the page. That book is there. Brother lawyer has that book. If you want studies on Christian education by EA Southerntherlands, just go to law. We will show you where to get it. But this book says something about the suits. I'm getting the page. Yeah, this is page. Uh yeah, page nine. This is page nine. It begins from page nine. Says the following one. Listen to me. I'm coming to the end of this presentation. If you're tired, don't worry. Another program is coming. It says this study should make it clear that the Protestant teachers weaken and unfitted the Protestant denomination for the attack made by the papacy through the counter system of education introduced by Ly Lyola founder of the order of Jews. Are we together? So if you are writing write this you need to write this and understand this is a good a good one that the order of Jesus was founded was was founded by who Ignatius lawyer which year 1530 34 are we together right that so we are told that through the system of education introduced by Ju papacy attacked the protestant what denomination alleo how many are protestants you want to protest you know when the topic presented Protest until death when a call is made all of us will decide to be protect protestants. Now 7th Day Adventist who are protestants in the last days must listen to this. It continues by saying before this the Catholic Church realized its helplessness to withstand the great movement of what? Protestantism. Hallelujah. Before the order of Jesus was created Catholic could not withstand protest protestantism. Are we together? Hallelujah. Hey, how many people are in this room? Stop joking with me. Hallelujah. Need to speak. Amen. So that you encourage me. Let me read this again. It says that before this the Catholic Church realized its helplessness to withstand the great movement of protestantism inaugurated by thousands of missionaries trained in the Christian schools of Luther and Mel Meelon. Are we together? I read something about history of Luther and Bangon. And we were told in the book studies on Christian education that Luther and Bangon understood the true science of what? education. Hallelujah. That is why it says in pamplet 081 that locus says to strengthen reformation the bible must be h people doesn't open p 081 page 37 there's something lu is saying we are referring to luther l the reason why there was success in luther's reformation was that l understood the true science of what education I want just 37 paragraph one says the early reformers realized They could not opt to succeed if their children were educated in Roman Catholic with Roman Catholic what? Teachers. Hallelujah. Roa says that the Bible must be studied. Teachers must be done what? Provided. Hallelujah. Do you know that God has given in his church all capabilities and abilities? Do you think we cannot get teachers from this congregation? They are teachers. Hallelujah. There are people who can teach. Amen. Brother Lord, do you want to tell me that you cannot teach? You can. But it is only that the ability of teaching is belongs to somewhere somewhere else. So Luther says, continue reading. Says that Luther says that the Bible must be studied. Uh teachers must be provided. Schools must be done. What? Make a just make a full stop that will make my presentation on Monday that school must be established. Hallelujah. We have to have our school our schools where we have our own teachers not teachers of Roman Catholic churches. Are we together? And somebody might ask me that. So teachers who are in general conference of 7th day Adventist. I will refer you to the Adventist timeline that is 1981 where Neil C. is declaring that the general conference as is another universal and truly Catholic what? Catholic church. Are we together? So Luther the the reason why Luther succeeded in reformation and could not be stopped by Catholics is that he understood the true science of what? Education. Nothing returned of the Protestant churches to dead orthodoxy under the inefficient leadership of Luther successors. The papar recognized the vulnerable point in what? Protestantism. Are we together? Purposely recognize what the vulnerable point in what? Protestantism. The order of Jesus found its special mission in combating the reformation. Reformation as the most effective means of arresting the progress of Protestantism. It aimed at controlling what? Education. Are we together? Good. I wish you so that when I when I read Yeah. You can help me read that point where it says that the protest the the order of Jesus funds it special mission. It says Jesus found it mission. The order of Jesus founds its mission special mission in combating the reformation as the most effective means of arresting the pro progress of protestantism. It aimed at controlling what? Education. If you want to control the farmers, what do you control? The education. much they are reformers they are serving brown chapati and brown rice they want to use they don't want to use aluminium alone they don't want to use plastic plates but if you want to combat them you only control their what leave alone the food they eat that one you cannot control them because when you make them go that they cannot buy food the teacher of ABC will tell them we can make our own food food the teacher of country living will tell them go to what countries and for your own what? Food. Food and you realize that a reformer will be able to produce his own maze, produce his own vegetables. But there's something that if you control it together. So it continues by saying it developed an immense educational activity. It developed immense educational activity in Protestant countries. In Protestant what? Countries. And add for it school a great reputation. Uhhuh. More than any other agency. It stayed the progress of reformation. Uh-huh. And it even succeeded in winning back a territory already conquered by Protestantis. It succeeded in winning back the ter territory or already conquered by what? Protestantism. Protestantism. Are you listening to this thing? Read that statement again. More than any other agency. More than any other agency. It stayed in the progress of the reformation and it even it even succeeded in winning succeeded in winning a place where Protestantism must conquer and conquer. Are we together? So if Protestantis would have conquered the place here in Sabume there's a church in Sabume for purposely through education will do what? Conquer it. Conquer conquer it. Amen. But if protesters are going to understand the true science of what education, then their information is going to succeed just like that one of me. Continue reading. It worked chiefly. It worked chiefly through its schools. Through its what? Schools. Of which of which it established. It established and control what? Large numbers. Large numbers. Hallelujah. Jesus are controlling what? Large numbers through what? Education. Education. Are we together? Remember chapter what? Chapter 4 where there was a a tree and every beast was under that what that tree and every human being could find meat under what what that tree and we realize that that tree is the system of what education are we together so education is everything in other words you need to understand that in the world education is everything just like redemption education is done what it's everything so you find yourself in the worldly system of education no no redemption no redemption amen no sanctification of The church, are we together? The church cannot be sanctified with the Jesuit system of what? Education. Are we together? No sanctification. Hallelujah. Just say amen. Continue reading, brother Lloy. Every member of their order, every member of their order became a became a competent and a practical what? Teacher. So who are teachers in those school? Competent and practical teacher. Teacher. Are we together? So Jesus were teachers. So if you want to know that Jesus are teachers go to the next you want to see the methods of their teaching. So if this methods are in some system education know that you are being taught by Jesus and by that you are going to observe the popish word right together. However much you come and tell us you read to us first that is first Thessalonians where Paul is talking about great apostasy. Yeah. First Thessalonians chapter 2 that the coming of Christ shall not be before great what? Apostasy before man of what? Man of sin. If you come and preach man of sin then there's another way you are going to observe the rise of the man of sin in another form another form. So look at this. The following it says the following methods of teaching the following methods of teaching are characteristic of Jesus are characteristics of Jesus what? Schools. Are we together? Listen to characteristics of Jesuit what? School. So if you see a school today with this characteristics know that that papacy is destroying what? Protestantism. And if protesters are taking their children to that system, let us just understand that this reformation is going to do what? To fall. Hallelujah.

Lord in heaven, our prayer is\n[10.3s] that you may help us in these last days\n[13.4s] to understand our work as a people to\n[17.0s] understand the position that we need to\n[18.5s] fail while Christ in this in the most\n[20.2s] holy place so that we make a decision\n[22.7s] that will fit us in eternity. For this\n[25.2s] is my humble prayer by faith in the\n[26.7s] precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n[30.3s] So uh welcome again to this\n[33.4s] presentation. We are at the point where\n[35.8s] we are studying about the skills that\n[39.2s] papers had to use to overthrow\n[42.0s] Protestantism. Louis saw that during\n[44.7s] that time in the Geneva after the truth\n[48.5s] had been published in that city a pro a\n[52.6s] protestant worship was established.\n[55.6s] And uh when this protestant worship was\n[58.3s] established, we are told that papacy was\n[62.5s] not happy with protestantism going on.\n[66.0s] Therefore, even in this last days after\n[67.6s] the truth has been has been preached, a\n[70.8s] protestantism worship has also be\n[73.9s] established and I told you that one\n[76.3s] thing one objective for the purposes is\n[79.7s] to overthrow Protestantism.\n[82.6s] We will get controversy by 234. We've\n[85.5s] realized that throughout let me repeat\n[88.6s] this quotation from the beginning. You\n[91.1s] can just help me read from the project\n[93.3s] so that all of us might get might get\n[96.2s] involved in this presentation. It it\n[99.3s] says it\n[101.3s] reads one. Uh let me let me this one\n[106.3s] should be\n[110.4s] one throughout throughout Christianom.\n[113.4s] Protestantism was by formidable force.\n[116.5s] Protestantism was by formidable force.\n[119.9s] Past triumph of information pass. The\n[121.9s] past trials of information passed like\n[124.1s] no and any other\n[127.0s] personh forces and Rome came with new\n[129.8s] what forces\n[131.9s] to accomplish his destruction to\n[133.8s] accomplish the destruction of what\n[137.8s] at this time? At this time order of\n[140.2s] Jesuit was created. Order of Jesus was\n[142.8s] done what? Created created. So for for\n[145.8s] Rome to to overthrow Protestantism, it\n[149.3s] had to come with another another force.\n[151.8s] And that for was that the order of Jesus\n[154.2s] was created. The most cruel they are the\n[158.3s] most cruel and scrupulous.\n[161.1s] as they cannot powerful of all the\n[163.7s] champions of the the most powerful of\n[166.6s] the champions\n[168.1s] of cut off\n[171.2s] from what\n[174.1s] in human interest in human interest to\n[177.8s] the claims of natural affliction. They\n[179.4s] are dead to the claims of natural\n[181.4s] affliction. Reason and concerns fall\n[183.9s] silence. Their results and concerns are\n[186.2s] to what? Silence. Silence. Hallelujah.\n[188.6s] Like in fact they work as papacy itself\n[190.9s] by the way do you know that papacy\n[192.6s] doesn't what change I remember when my\n[196.0s] brother Maxwell was presenting another\n[198.2s] day here he read a quotation where he\n[200.6s] said that robe never changes hallelujah\n[204.2s] that is the characteristics of\n[206.9s] that as I'm presenting this I remember\n[209.9s] another presentation during prophecy\n[212.1s] that there are how many things that must\n[213.8s] happen five things that must happen and\n[217.7s] one of things that there was death of\n[220.7s] whatantism. Then people shall view\n[222.9s] papacy in a positive what a positive\n[225.8s] view. So you need to understand that in\n[227.7s] the last days what must be destroyed.\n[230.2s] Then the papacy believe that is\n[232.9s] protestant protest. Don't protesting\n[236.2s] must be destroy destroyed. But the Bible\n[238.6s] says that the papacy is going to destroy\n[241.8s] these people skillfully and what?\n[244.7s] Wonderfully. Wonderfully. Continue\n[246.4s] reading. They knew no rule. They knew no\n[248.6s] rule. No tie. No tie. But that of their\n[251.2s] order. But that of their order. And no\n[253.1s] duty but to extend its powers. The\n[256.0s] gospel of Christ, the gospel of Christ\n[258.5s] enable it. Enable it.\n[262.2s] Endure suffering. And endure what?\n[265.0s] Suffering. Suffering. Hallelujah. Amen.\n[268.0s] To make decision for Christ need to\n[270.6s] understand for Christ what? Danger and\n[274.5s] suffering. Suffering. That is what the\n[275.8s] Bible says. Hallelujah. And we always\n[278.8s] saying that must be of the skies on\n[282.5s] earth of what\n[285.1s] others the pride. Hallelujah. So you\n[287.7s] need to understand that those who are\n[289.7s] going to go to heaven must suffer\n[292.1s] what? Hallelujah. Early writings I'm\n[295.7s] putting you that heaven is cheap enough\n[297.9s] through what? Suffering. Suffering.\n[299.6s] Hallelujah. Amen. We need to understand\n[302.2s] that the the the principles of\n[304.7s] Christianity allowed their adherence to\n[307.4s] do what? to\n[309.1s] suffer to uh the gospel of Christ had\n[312.6s] enabled its to meet danger and endure\n[316.2s] suffering and is made by call hunger\n[319.6s] toil and poverty to uphold the bar of\n[322.9s] the truth in the face in face of the\n[325.6s] rock the dion and the and the stake to\n[329.2s] combat this\n[331.2s] process jud inspired its followers\n[335.2s] withism that enabled them to endure the\n[337.7s] like What? Like forces, like ders. Are\n[340.8s] we together? And to oppose to the power\n[343.1s] of truth all weapons of\n[346.5s] deceptions. There was no crime too great\n[349.3s] for them to do what? To commit. To\n[350.8s] commit. No deception too p to do what?\n[353.5s] To practice. Practice. Hallelujah. Amen.\n[356.1s] It continues by saying no is too\n[358.5s] difficult for them to do what? To\n[359.9s] assume. Hallelujah. Jesus can assume\n[362.6s] everything. Amen. Jesus can even come to\n[365.6s] the meeting and sit together with you.\n[367.4s] Hallelujah. And when you will bearing\n[369.9s] those who are going to comment after\n[371.6s] less can carry up their comment.\n[375.0s] Hallelujah. But that great order is to\n[377.4s] destroy what roantantism and all the\n[380.1s] weapons of deception are going to be\n[383.0s] established. It continues by saying that\n[385.8s] B to perpetual what? Poverty and\n[389.4s] humility. It was their studied aim to\n[392.7s] secure wealth and power to be devoted to\n[395.3s] the overthrow of what? Protestantism and\n[398.4s] to reestablish the purpose of popular\n[400.4s] what? Supremacy. Hallelujah. So the\n[402.7s] order of Jesuits what Jesuits are\n[404.6s] working for is to overthrow what?\n[407.2s] Protestantism and establish what?\n[410.1s] Supremacy. Do you know that papacy knows\n[412.6s] very well that when protestantism\n[415.2s] increases then their power is going to\n[418.1s] do what? Decrease. Great controversy 39\n[421.0s] will tell you that when these people\n[422.9s] continue preaching they shall be burning\n[425.0s] their own altars. Are we together? If\n[428.2s] protesters continue to preach, they are\n[430.5s] going to burn the altars of papacy. Are\n[433.4s] we together? So we are told\n[437.6s] that while appearing as a member of\n[439.9s] their council, I want that to be\n[441.3s] projected with this\n[446.5s] electricity. Amen.\n[454.6s] Selen\n[456.0s] proceed that one is coming. I'm still in\n[458.6s] great controversy page 235 paragraph\n[461.4s] one. This is the last thing I'm reading\n[462.8s] in great controversy. Then after that\n[464.6s] I'm going to read something in a book\n[466.4s] called Christian studies on Christian\n[468.0s] education. Then by the end of that I'll\n[470.4s] be able to end my presentation.\n[473.8s] It continues by saying while appearing,\n[477.0s] are you able to read? Proceed. While\n[479.4s] appearing as the members of their order,\n[481.4s] while Jesus appearing at the members of\n[483.3s] their order, they wore a g of sanctity.\n[485.3s] They have a g of sanctity. Visiting\n[487.6s] prisons and hosts visiting prisons and\n[490.0s] what hosts.\n[491.9s] Ministering to the sick. They minister\n[493.5s] to the what? The sick. To the sick and\n[495.9s] the poor.

They bear the\n[504.1s] sacred name of Jesus. Jesus went about\n[506.9s] doing what? Doing good. Doing good. Are\n[509.1s] we together? So we are told that all\n[511.1s] these Christians they also they bear the\n[513.0s] name of Jesus. They are doing good just\n[515.2s] like Jesus. Are we together? Did Jesus\n[517.9s] care for the poor? Yes, he cared. Did he\n[520.3s] care for the sick? Absolutely he cared.\n[522.3s] Hallelujah. So Jesus are also doing the\n[524.4s] same the same. But next statement says\n[527.0s] continue. But under this blameless\n[529.0s] exterior, under this blameless exterior,\n[531.8s] most criminal and deadly purposes,\n[533.8s] criminal and deadly what purposes were\n[536.9s] were often done what? Concealed. It was\n[539.7s] the fundamental principle of the order\n[543.0s] that the end justifies the what the\n[546.2s] means. Hallelujah. Jesus know very well\n[548.4s] that if you want to accomplish\n[550.0s] something, what you want to accomplish\n[552.0s] will be showing you what to do at the\n[553.6s] present state. Are we together? Just\n[556.3s] talk to me. the electricity. So I want\n[558.5s] to get encouraged. I'm soon finishing\n[560.2s] this presentation. Hallelujah.

By this code,\n[575.1s] lying,\n[577.5s] theft, assassination were not only\n[580.6s] various this guy uh were not only\n[583.4s] pardonable but com commendable. When\n[586.6s] they serve the interest of the the\n[589.3s] church and various disguise the Jesus\n[592.5s] worked their way into offices of what\n[595.8s] state. Are we together? They work their\n[598.0s] way into the office of the the state. So\n[600.4s] who are advising R today? Jesuits. Are\n[603.6s] we together? Who are advising other\n[606.2s] presidents? The Jesuits just say because\n[608.9s] that is what the testimony says.

Is that\n[664.9s] skillful? The Bible says that the the\n[667.2s] purpose he destroys wonderfully and\n[669.5s] skillfully. So when he want to deal with\n[671.6s] the church then he established what\n[673.8s] colleges for the those who have money\n[675.7s] are we together those who have money for\n[678.7s] those who don't have money schools are\n[681.2s] establish then they take their what\n[683.5s] their children are we together that is\n[685.8s] purpose and I'm talking about purple\n[687.9s] system of what education but I need to\n[690.6s] know in your mind that there's another\n[692.6s] kind of what education hallelujah I want\n[695.6s] to get I want you to get me right so\n[698.4s] this is the establish colleges for the\n[700.8s] sons of the princes and no nobles and\n[705.3s] schools for the common what the common\n[707.5s] people and we are told that the children\n[710.2s] of protesters were drawn into an\n[713.0s] observance of poish what rights all the\n[716.6s] outward pump and display of romanish\n[720.2s] worship was brought to bear to confuse\n[723.7s] the mind and dazzle and captivate the\n[727.3s] imagination and that's the liberty for\n[729.6s] which the fathers had toiled and bled\n[733.1s] was betrayed by the what? The sons. The\n[736.4s] Jews rapidly spread themselves over\n[738.8s] what? Europe. And wherever they went,\n[741.7s] they followed a revival of what? Pop.\n[745.6s] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So we are told\n[749.0s] that while they me, they visit what?\n[751.8s] Prisons and do what? Visit oceptals.\n[756.2s] Then they care for the po the poor. Then\n[758.8s] they establish what? Colleges and school\n[761.5s] and school. And this quotation says that\n[764.2s] where they went what followed a revival\n[767.7s] of what? Popery. Hallelujah. And we are\n[770.5s] told that the liberty that the father\n[773.9s] toiled was betrayed by the son the sons.\n[776.9s] So that is how to destroy what?\n[778.7s] Protestantism. Hallelujah. If you want\n[780.8s] to destroy protestants, you just use\n[783.0s] their what? Their children. Are we\n[785.1s] together? So fathers are toiling for\n[787.0s] liberty. Then the children's\n[789.2s] betray are we together. So that is what\n[791.8s] they are doing.\n[794.0s] Hallelujah. Let me finish. Studies on\n[796.3s] Christian education. Studies on\n[798.6s] Christian\n[799.9s] education. Studies on Christian\n[801.8s] education. Let me read this page as I am\n[805.4s] coming to the end of my presentation so\n[806.9s] that we might have social meeting. I\n[808.7s] wish electricity will be there so that\n[810.7s] this one be\n[812.8s] projected. Studies on Christian\n[814.9s] education. Let me read this page. I'm\n[817.4s] giving you the page. That book is there.\n[819.7s] Brother lawyer has that book. If you\n[821.5s] want studies on Christian education by\n[824.0s] EA Southerntherlands, just go to law. We\n[826.3s] will show you where to get it. But this\n[828.2s] book says something about the\n[831.6s] suits. I'm getting the\n[839.3s] page. Yeah, this is page.\n[845.1s] Uh yeah, page nine. This is page nine.\n[848.3s] It begins from page nine. Says the\n[850.7s] following one. Listen to me. I'm coming\n[852.2s] to the end of this presentation. If\n[854.0s] you're tired, don't worry. Another\n[856.2s] program is coming. It says this study\n[859.9s] should make it clear that the Protestant\n[862.7s] teachers weaken and unfitted the\n[865.9s] Protestant denomination for the attack\n[868.6s] made by the papacy through the counter\n[871.4s] system of education introduced by Ly\n[875.1s] Lyola founder of the order of Jews. Are\n[878.6s] we together? So if you are writing write\n[880.6s] this you need to write this and\n[881.9s] understand this is a good a good one\n[883.8s] that the order of Jesus was founded was\n[886.1s] was founded by who Ignatius lawyer which\n[889.3s] year\n[890.3s] 1530 34 are we together right that so we\n[893.9s] are told that through the system of\n[895.8s] education introduced by Ju papacy\n[899.0s] attacked the protestant what\n[900.9s] denomination alleo how many are\n[903.3s] protestants you want to\n[905.7s] protest you know when the topic\n[908.5s] presented Protest until death when a\n[910.4s] call is made all of us will decide to be\n[912.6s] protect protestants. Now 7th Day\n[914.6s] Adventist who are protestants in the\n[916.6s] last days must listen to this. It\n[918.4s] continues by saying before this the\n[920.9s] Catholic Church realized its\n[923.7s] helplessness to withstand the great\n[926.3s] movement of what?\n[928.3s] Protestantism. Hallelujah. Before the\n[930.7s] order of Jesus was created Catholic\n[933.5s] could not withstand protest\n[936.0s] protestantism. Are we together?\n[939.2s] Hallelujah. Hey, how many people are in\n[942.0s] this\n[946.0s] room? Stop joking with me. Hallelujah.\n[949.0s] Need to speak. Amen. So that you\n[951.0s] encourage me. Let me read this again. It\n[953.4s] says that before this the Catholic\n[956.3s] Church realized its helplessness to\n[959.1s] withstand the great movement of\n[962.2s] protestantism inaugurated by thousands\n[965.0s] of missionaries trained in the Christian\n[968.0s] schools of Luther and Mel Meelon. Are we\n[972.0s] together? I read something about history\n[974.5s] of Luther and Bangon. And we were told\n[976.6s] in the book studies on Christian\n[977.9s] education that Luther and Bangon\n[980.1s] understood the true science of what?\n[982.3s] education. Hallelujah. That is why it\n[984.9s] says in pamplet 081 that locus says to\n[989.1s] strengthen reformation the bible must be\n[992.2s] h people doesn't open p 081 page 37\n[995.9s] there's something lu is saying we are\n[997.8s] referring to luther l the reason why\n[1000.4s] there was success in luther's\n[1002.0s] reformation was that l understood the\n[1004.8s] true science of what education I want\n[1007.1s] just 37 paragraph one\n[1009.6s] says the early reformers realized\n[1014.3s] They could not opt to\n[1016.3s] succeed if their children were educated\n[1019.6s] in Roman Catholic with Roman Catholic\n[1022.6s] what? Teachers. Hallelujah. Roa says\n[1027.0s] that the Bible must be\n[1031.3s] studied. Teachers must be done what?\n[1034.3s] Provided. Hallelujah. Do you know that\n[1036.9s] God has given in his church all\n[1038.6s] capabilities and abilities? Do you think\n[1040.9s] we cannot get teachers from this\n[1042.2s] congregation? They are teachers.\n[1044.1s] Hallelujah. There are people who can\n[1046.1s] teach. Amen. Brother Lord, do you want\n[1048.4s] to tell me that you cannot teach? You\n[1050.2s] can. But it is only that the ability of\n[1052.2s] teaching is belongs to somewhere\n[1053.8s] somewhere else. So Luther says, continue\n[1055.9s] reading.\n[1057.4s] Says that Luther says that the Bible\n[1060.8s] must be studied. Uh teachers must be\n[1065.6s] provided. Schools must be done. What?\n[1069.3s] Make a just make a full stop that will\n[1071.4s] make my presentation on Monday that\n[1073.3s] school must be established. Hallelujah.\n[1075.9s] We have to have our school our schools\n[1078.2s] where we have our own teachers not\n[1079.8s] teachers of Roman Catholic churches. Are\n[1082.2s] we together? And somebody might ask me\n[1085.4s] that. So teachers who are in general\n[1087.5s] conference of 7th day Adventist. I will\n[1089.5s] refer you to the Adventist timeline that\n[1092.4s] is\n[1093.4s] 1981 where Neil C. is declaring that the\n[1096.3s] general conference as is another\n[1098.0s] universal and truly Catholic what?\n[1099.9s] Catholic church. Are we together? So\n[1102.0s] Luther the the reason why Luther\n[1104.1s] succeeded in reformation and could not\n[1106.1s] be stopped by Catholics is that he\n[1108.0s] understood the true science of what?\n[1109.5s] Education. Nothing returned of the\n[1112.2s] Protestant churches to dead orthodoxy\n[1115.1s] under the inefficient leadership of\n[1117.3s] Luther successors. The papar recognized\n[1120.4s] the vulnerable point in what?\n[1123.6s] Protestantism. Are we together?\n[1125.8s] Purposely recognize what the vulnerable\n[1128.4s] point in what? Protestantism. The order\n[1131.4s] of Jesus found its special mission in\n[1134.6s] combating the reformation. Reformation\n[1137.0s] as the most effective means of arresting\n[1141.0s] the progress of Protestantism. It aimed\n[1144.8s] at controlling\n[1146.9s] what? Education. Are we together? Good.\n[1150.8s] I wish\n[1152.4s] you so that when I when I\n[1157.7s] read Yeah. You can help me read that\n[1160.2s] point where it says that the protest the\n[1163.0s] the order of Jesus funds it special\n[1164.6s] mission. It says Jesus found it mission.\n[1169.7s] The order of Jesus founds its\n[1172.2s] mission special\n[1174.1s] mission in combating the\n[1177.2s] reformation as the most effective\n[1180.9s] means of arresting the pro progress of\n[1185.1s] protestantism. It aimed at controlling\n[1188.8s] what? Education. If you want to control\n[1192.1s] the farmers, what do you control? The\n[1194.1s] education.\n[1195.8s] much they are reformers they are serving\n[1197.3s] brown chapati and brown rice they want\n[1199.3s] to use they don't want to use aluminium\n[1202.0s] alone they don't want to use plastic\n[1204.6s] plates but if you want to combat them\n[1206.7s] you only control their what leave alone\n[1208.9s] the food they eat that one you cannot\n[1211.4s] control them because when you make them\n[1214.2s] go that they cannot buy food the teacher\n[1217.4s] of ABC will tell them we can make our\n[1219.7s] own food food the teacher of country\n[1222.2s] living will tell them go to what\n[1224.1s] countries and for your own what? Food.\n[1225.9s] Food and you realize that a reformer\n[1227.3s] will be able to produce his own maze,\n[1229.8s] produce his own vegetables. But there's\n[1232.0s] something that if you\n[1233.8s] control it together. So it continues by\n[1236.6s] saying\n[1238.6s] it developed an immense educational\n[1240.2s] activity. It developed immense\n[1242.3s] educational activity in Protestant\n[1244.2s] countries. In Protestant what?\n[1246.3s] Countries. And add for it school a great\n[1248.8s] reputation. Uhhuh. More than any other\n[1251.4s] agency. It stayed the progress of\n[1253.4s] reformation. Uh-huh. And it even\n[1255.0s] succeeded in winning back a territory\n[1257.4s] already conquered by Protestantis. It\n[1259.4s] succeeded in winning back the ter\n[1261.8s] territory or already conquered by what?\n[1264.0s] Protestantism. Protestantism. Are you\n[1265.8s] listening to this\n[1269.2s] thing? Read that statement again. More\n[1271.9s] than any other agency. More than any\n[1274.0s] other agency. It stayed in the progress\n[1275.8s] of the reformation and it even it even\n[1279.0s] succeeded in winning succeeded in\n[1280.6s] winning a place where Protestantism must\n[1284.3s] conquer and conquer. Are we together? So\n[1286.7s] if Protestantis would have conquered the\n[1288.5s] place here in Sabume there's a church in\n[1290.2s] Sabume for purposely through education\n[1292.2s] will do what? Conquer it. Conquer\n[1293.9s] conquer it. Amen. But if protesters are\n[1296.6s] going to understand the true science of\n[1297.9s] what education, then their information\n[1300.2s] is going to succeed just like that one\n[1302.3s] of me. Continue reading. It worked\n[1305.4s] chiefly. It worked chiefly through its\n[1307.6s] schools. Through its what? Schools. Of\n[1310.3s] which of which it established. It\n[1312.4s] established and control what? Large\n[1314.2s] numbers. Large numbers. Hallelujah.\n[1315.9s] Jesus are controlling what? Large\n[1318.1s] numbers through what? Education.\n[1319.9s] Education. Are we together? Remember\n[1322.1s] chapter what? Chapter 4 where there was\n[1324.2s] a a tree and every beast was under that\n[1327.1s] what that tree and every human being\n[1329.7s] could find meat under what what that\n[1331.6s] tree and we realize that that tree is\n[1333.2s] the system of what education are we\n[1335.4s] together so education is everything in\n[1337.7s] other words you need to understand that\n[1339.5s] in the world education is everything\n[1342.0s] just like redemption education is done\n[1343.7s] what it's everything so you find\n[1345.4s] yourself in the worldly system of\n[1347.0s] education no no redemption no\n[1349.6s] redemption amen no sanctification of\n[1352.8s] The church, are we together? The church\n[1354.8s] cannot be sanctified with the Jesuit\n[1357.0s] system of what? Education. Are we\n[1359.2s] together? No sanctification.\n[1361.7s] Hallelujah. Just say amen. Continue\n[1364.2s] reading, brother Lloy. Every member of\n[1366.2s] their order, every member of their order\n[1368.6s] became a became a competent and a\n[1371.5s] practical what? Teacher. So who are\n[1374.0s] teachers in those school? Competent and\n[1376.7s] practical teacher. Teacher. Are we\n[1378.5s] together? So Jesus were teachers. So if\n[1381.0s] you want to know that Jesus are teachers\n[1382.6s] go to the next you want to see the\n[1384.0s] methods of their teaching. So if this\n[1385.6s] methods are in some system education\n[1387.8s] know that you are being taught by Jesus\n[1390.3s] and by that you are going to observe the\n[1393.2s] popish word right together. However much\n[1396.1s] you come and tell us you read to us\n[1398.4s] first that is first Thessalonians where\n[1400.6s] Paul is talking about great apostasy.\n[1402.9s] Yeah. First Thessalonians chapter 2 that\n[1404.8s] the coming of Christ shall not be before\n[1406.5s] great what? Apostasy before man of what?\n[1409.0s] Man of sin. If you come and preach man\n[1411.1s] of sin then there's another way you are\n[1413.0s] going to observe the rise of the man of\n[1415.2s] sin in another form another form. So\n[1417.0s] look at this. The following it says the\n[1418.7s] following methods of teaching the\n[1420.1s] following methods of teaching are\n[1421.8s] characteristic of Jesus are\n[1423.7s] characteristics of Jesus what? Schools.\n[1426.2s] Are we together? Listen to\n[1427.8s] characteristics of Jesuit what? School.\n[1429.8s] So if you see a school today with this\n[1431.4s] characteristics know that that papacy is\n[1434.2s] destroying what? Protestantism. And if\n[1436.3s] protesters are taking their children to\n[1437.9s] that system, let us just understand that\n[1440.2s] this reformation is going to do what? To\n[1442.2s] fall. Hallelujah. We realize that what\n[1444.7s] made the fall of the denomination in\n[1447.3s] 1844 is that they never understood the\n[1449.5s] true science of what? Education.\n[1451.0s] Education. Hallelujah. And we are told\n[1453.0s] that the condition of those Protestants\n[1455.2s] is is is explained by the foolish what?\n[1459.4s] Virgins. What were the foolish virgins\n[1461.4s] lacking? Oil. The oil. Are we together?\n[1464.2s] So a true science of education is an oil\n[1467.1s] to the lamp. The lamp. If that oil is\n[1469.8s] removed, the lamp must do what? Must\n[1472.2s] die. Are we together? Even this church\n[1474.2s] today, if that lamp is removed from the\n[1477.0s] church, the church must die. The oil is\n[1479.4s] removed from the lamp. If that oil is\n[1481.1s] removed from the lamp, the church must\n[1482.7s] do what? Do you know the reason why\n[1484.5s] there's confusion in the church? There's\n[1487.8s] no if there is no what? And and if there\n[1490.9s] is oil, that oil is not pure. Are we\n[1494.5s] together? That oil is still mixed with\n[1496.7s] kerosene. Are we\n[1498.2s] together? Still mix with some petrol.\n[1500.6s] It's not pure. What? Pl. So there's\n[1502.6s] going to be a confusion in the what?\n[1505.8s] Continue reading. The following methods\n[1507.3s] of teaching The following methods of\n[1509.0s] teaching are characteristic of are\n[1511.0s] characteristics of Jesuit school. The\n[1513.0s] memory was cultivated. The memory was\n[1514.7s] cultivated as a means of as a means of\n[1517.8s] of keeping down reactivity of thought\n[1519.9s] reactivity of thought and clearness of\n[1522.2s] judgment and clearness of judgment. I\n[1524.0s] don't understand that statement. Brother\n[1525.6s] help me\n[1527.2s] understand. Help me understand that\n[1529.2s] statement. I would read because the\n[1530.6s] memory was cultivated as a means of\n[1532.5s] keeping down of reactivity of thought\n[1534.5s] and clearness of judgment.\n[1537.4s] Hey, these statements by these people\n[1539.1s] are very difficult. Continue reading. I\n[1541.8s] know we are going to understand the next\n[1543.1s] statement will help us understand the\n[1545.3s] other one. Continue.

What is\n[1579.6s] emulation?\n[1581.6s] Coping coping. Coping. Coping. Coping.\n[1586.0s] There's coping. Coping someone else. You\n[1588.9s] just imitation. That is what so the what\n[1591.9s] the first thing of the methods of\n[1595.0s] education is cop. Are you together? You\n[1598.6s] study someone's mind.

Uhhuh. The\n[1609.4s] Jesus made much of emulation. He who\n[1612.4s] knows how to exite emulation. He who\n[1615.0s] knows how to do what? Exite emulation.\n[1617.7s] Exite emulation has found the most\n[1620.2s] powerful auxiliary in his teaching.\n[1622.0s] Uh-huh. Continue reading. Nothing will\n[1624.4s] be more honorable. Nothing will be more\n[1626.3s] honorable in the Jesuit system of school\n[1628.7s] than to outstrip a fellow student. To\n[1631.0s] outstrip a fellow what?\n[1634.8s] student that is the system of\n[1637.4s] education that if you another another\n[1641.3s] student imagine you are in top 10\n[1644.6s] imagine in a class of 600 I was in a\n[1647.4s] school where one class was 639 and\n[1651.0s] imagine you are the first one to be\n[1652.4s] called and you are given honorsh you\n[1655.3s] given hope that is the system of educ\n[1659.0s] education are we together continue\n[1661.6s] reading Nothing will be more honorable\n[1663.3s] to the out of our fellow student to\n[1665.2s] outstrip a fellow student. And nothing\n[1667.4s] more dishonorable than to be\n[1668.7s] outstripped. Nothing more dishonorable\n[1671.3s] than to be\n[1682.0s] out. Do you know the\n[1684.9s] education? Are you together? Hallelujah.\n[1688.9s] Church members, are we together? Repeat\n[1691.4s] that point. Says nothing will be more\n[1694.0s] honorable than to outstrip a fellow\n[1695.8s] student. Uhhuh. And nothing more\n[1697.6s] dishonorable than to be outstripped.\n[1699.6s] Uhhuh. Rises will be distributed.

Amen.\n[1732.2s] that is system of\n[1736.0s] education and and that will tell me that\n[1739.0s] if that system of education where they\n[1741.1s] strive and competition the Bible says it\n[1743.9s] is when I go to James 3:14 James 3:14\n[1748.7s] says the following words James James\n[1751.4s] 3:14 I want to tell you that's the\n[1753.8s] system of education where people compete\n[1756.8s] and nothing is so honorable when you\n[1759.0s] strip another student and nothing is so\n[1761.4s] dishonorable when you are outstripped\n[1763.5s] that system of wisdom.

I'm still in studies on Christian\n[2033.5s] education. I'm coming back to page page\n[2036.4s] five and then page five is this is it\n[2040.7s] page five but page\n[2043.9s] six page\n[2046.0s] six just page six 7th day Adventist\n[2049.4s] should know should not let this fact I\n[2051.8s] don't know if you are at that place is\n[2053.4s] it around page six or five you can just\n[2055.5s] check\n[2058.6s] five how many are seventh day Adventist\n[2062.2s] you don't want to carry off your hands\n[2063.6s] How many are seventh day Adventist?\n[2065.4s] Listen to this.

The three leading schools of\n[2080.0s] the colonies. The three leading schools\n[2082.0s] of the colonies were established by men\n[2084.1s] who had fled from the purple doctrine of\n[2086.2s] the old world. Uh-huh. But but these\n[2089.4s] educators Uhhuh. because of their\n[2091.4s] training in this school. Because of\n[2092.6s] their training in purple what? Schools.\n[2094.8s] Schools. And their ignorance of the\n[2096.6s] relation between education and religion\n[2098.7s] unwittingly pardon their institution out\n[2101.6s] of the educational systemh of the church\n[2104.2s] from which they had withdrawn. Uh-huh.\n[2106.6s] It is surprising that this English\n[2108.6s] reformers, these English reformers after\n[2110.9s] sacrificing after sacrificing as they\n[2113.6s] did for a worthy cause as they did for a\n[2115.7s] worthy cause should yet allow our system\n[2118.0s] of education should yet allow our system\n[2119.8s] of education so unfitted to all their\n[2122.1s] purposes fitted to all their purposes be\n[2124.3s] in reality to be in reality n of their\n[2127.0s] children the n of their children on\n[2129.0s] which most of these children drew their\n[2130.6s] nourishment they did not realize that\n[2133.5s] the character and the Christian\n[2134.9s] experience of These children depended on\n[2137.4s] what? Upon the nature of the food\n[2139.2s] received. Uhhuh. Had they grasped the\n[2141.2s] relation of education of the child to\n[2143.4s] the experience of the same individual in\n[2145.5s] the church, they would not have borrowed\n[2147.4s] their purple system education but would\n[2150.5s] have cast it out of bodily as too\n[2153.7s] dangerous for tolerance.

It is important that young\n[2329.4s] seventh day adventist. It is important\n[2331.2s] that young seventh day what? Adventist.\n[2334.2s] Adventist stud seriously. Study\n[2336.8s] seriously the cause of spiritual\n[2338.8s] decline. because of spiritual decline of\n[2341.9s] these churches in 184 churches in 18\n[2344.4s] what? 44. Lest we lest we repeat their\n[2348.2s] history. Lest we repeat their history.\n[2350.3s] Repeat their what? History. Uh-huh. And\n[2352.2s] be cast aside the spirit of God. Aside\n[2354.6s] with the spirit of God and thus lose out\n[2356.8s] place in the kingdom. And thus lose out\n[2359.1s] place in the what? Kingdom. If seventh\n[2361.4s] day adventist succeed where they fail.\n[2363.4s] If seventh day Adventist succeed where\n[2365.7s] the Protestant fail, we must have a\n[2368.1s] system of education. We must have a\n[2370.7s] system of education which repudiates\n[2372.6s] those principles repudiates all the\n[2375.4s] principles which in themselves which in\n[2377.6s] themselves develop the beast and his\n[2379.4s] image. develop the beast and its what?\n[2382.3s] Image. Image. Now all these things\n[2384.2s] happen un Now all these things happened\n[2386.8s] unto them for an example. For an example\n[2389.3s] and they are written for admonition.\n[2390.6s] They are written for our what?\n[2391.9s] Admonition. admonition upon whom the\n[2394.1s] ends of the world are come. Hallelujah.\n[2396.6s] Let me stop from that point. I'll pick\n[2399.2s] from that point where we are told that\n[2401.6s] we have to have a system of education\n[2403.4s] that will repudiate all the principles\n[2405.4s] that make the image of the what? The\n[2407.4s] beast. Hallelujah. But yesterday we\n[2409.1s] studied and realized that much of the\n[2412.6s] current system of education is of the\n[2415.7s] character that will give the image of\n[2417.4s] the beast power. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.\n[2421.8s] Are we together? That we read in 140\n[2425.7s] page\n[2427.1s] 12. May God really help us church\n[2430.1s] members to understand the true science\n[2432.5s] of education that is the three angels.\n[2435.6s] The three angels message. Hallelujah. So\n[2438.3s] I I want to give comments for only two\n[2441.4s] people to comment because I know\n[2444.0s] questions will take a lot of time and\n[2446.5s] time keeper is relying on. So if you\n[2449.0s] have a question"

        "full_transcript": "Yes. And the spirit say Yes. Yes. And behold, behold and great beast came out of the sea. Four great beast. So you can see those beast. Four great beasts. Remember in our last lesson we saw what beast is. I'm not going to ask you a question because it's raining but we saw what a beast is peace is the kingdom led by kings and you told what she is see the multitude of people so these are four kingdoms coming where there's multitude of people highly populated place now there's something I want you to see tonight which I saw today on my way to road I saw it today and I thought that before we sleep I have to present please that you may also be able to know what good Friday is and who is being woripped this one Daniel for so long time ago now what I saw today is in this four beast this four beast the revelation 7 this is what I saw today but I want to begin that you may be able to follow the Bible and then you will be I'm going to compare notes with what I saw today. Now go to verse number three. The Bible says, \"And four and four great beasts.\" Four great beasts. And four great beasts, yes, came up from the sea. Why don't you use a microphone? People sitting here, I sure that the microphone works. Thank you so much. are four great beasts. And the four great beasts, yes, came up from the sea. So these four beasts are coming out of the sea. Diver see the four beast. Yes. Diverse one from another. One from another. That means the first one came. Now after the first one has gone, the second one comes. And diverse means that they were not coming. They didn't come all of them at once. Now these four beasts which we read in the Bible that there are four kingdoms. You go to Daniel 7 verse 20. Would you read it with us? Verse 24. The Bible reads the Bible read. And the 10 horns out sorry he said the fourth news shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth. So that is these are kingdoms. Verse 17 is very clear more than that beasts. These great four beasts which are four which are four are four kings are four kings which shall rise out of the earth. So this beast represent what? Kings. Kingdoms and kingdoms are led by kings. So when you look at this beast, these are four kingdoms and the Bible says they are the kingdoms that will be there in this earth and then after them being there then this one will come to what an end to an end. How many are listening to me? Let me see if you are with me. Are you sure we are with me? We thank God. So look Daniel 7 has gone to the wine time. Now the chapter 7 is the same as I will not be following these things consequentially or sequentially but you can grasp this. Now listen that uh these are the four kingdoms they are working diverse meaning they will not work at the same time. When one cometh, when it comes to an end, another one followth. Like that, like that, like that. Now Daniel says, \"They did not come at once, but they came diverse from each other.\" Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah church. Amen. Now these are the four kingdom. Now if you want to know where the world is, you go back to Daniel chapter 2 and Daniel chapter 7. And said we have been preaching these things but our churches don't understand that we never read last time on drugs because today many people learn that many people but this makes us and they are not getting the right treatment that they should come. Today I want us also coming like a lion organization lions eagle wings now with worry as I beheld many people who are suffering from I want to go very fast among many other now receiving this drugs and many people were worried that Kenyan faces HIV treatment crisis as only 6 months supply of ARV drugs remaining so many people have been worried that when there is no supply of these drugs what is the way forward or what is the solution we've learned that we have reached a time that we are going to They are the same. We see in Daniel chapter 2, Babylon is represented by gold. In Daniel chapter 7, Babylon is represented by what? Lion. Lion. So this is the first kingdom that never ruled the world that became the superpower. And all of you if you read the book of Daniel chapter one, you know that is Nebuchadnezzar that captured the people of God. and to Babylon. You know Jeremiah during his time is when these people were captured by God allowed because the people had opposed the s. So this is the first kingdom. You all know that lion is the king of the world the jungle. He is all powerful and it is said that it's powerful more than all animals. That is what is being known. So you all know in Daniel chapter 2 God is telling Nebuchadnezzar that you will be like God but you will come and go and another kingdom will follow you and the kingdom that will follow you will not be greater as you what are as you are. So that means Babylon was so much great. But the king of follow Babylon was not going to be great as what? How many are listening to me? That is why when you look at that Daniel chapter 2, you see the image there is gold and then followed by silver and then bronze and then iron. Then iron mixed with what? that it is shall be to down. Why? That after Babylon the economy will be going what? Down just as gold is the precious metal then followed by silver followed by bronze followed by iron. So that is how the economy will be depreciating. So there will be no appreciation as these kingdoms are working diverse from each other. The Bible says it will be what? Now if you read the book of the Bible Daniel in Revelation, then God's people cannot engage in politics. Number one, you cannot engage politics when somebody tells you that he will bring what you he bottom up. He will make the economy to be blew aart. Why? The Bible says after Babylon we will go to there which is silver and then we'll go to bronze and then we will go to iron that means economy will be what? So friends, let me tell you a vote of me will not be good. Even if you vote me, even if I leave preaching today and then you elect me to be a governor of this county, there's nothing I can do for you. Why? The Bible says that when the fourth kingdom will be working, it will be iron mixed with what? meaning the economy gone. I see people are quarreling. Our economy is bad. Our economy is bad. R is bad and people are being recruited into JC movements. The reason why you can join join JZ movement so that you may be able to fight for the economy is because you do not understand the Bible prophecies. Those who understand the Bible prophecy, he cannot be engaged in any movement. Why? because they know that the Bible is very clear that the kingdom if you wanted a good economy then you to live in the what in the Babylonian Empire and that is why those two of them who got Babylonian mind is going to the street to fight for the ina people are able to die personally my brother was killed and was buried fighting for the economy of this What is now bad but now is our economy good? Nothing. So those who have Babian minds will always fight for good economy. But those who are Christians indeed will not fight for the economy. Why? The Bible says that as we come from Babylon then the economy will be what? Depreciating like that toast was at least good. So if you wanted good economy maybe you would have lived in the time of what the departure and then during what this g at least it was bronze because in in Kenya year number one is being given gold medal number two silver medal number three bronze bronze and then number",

Why\n[103.5s] don't you use a\n[105.9s] microphone? People sitting here, I sure\n[108.9s] that the microphone\n[113.9s] works. Thank you so much.\n[119.5s] are four great beasts. And the four\n[122.6s] great beasts, yes, came up from the sea.\n[125.4s] So these four beasts are coming out of\n[127.6s] the sea. Diver see the four beast.\n[131.2s] Yes. Diverse one from another. One from\n[135.0s] another. That means the first one came.\n[139.3s] Now after the first one has gone, the\n[141.3s] second one comes. And diverse means that\n[145.1s] they were not coming. They didn't come\n[147.5s] all of them at once. Now these four\n[150.2s] beasts which we read in the Bible that\n[153.1s] there are four kingdoms. You go to\n[155.3s] Daniel 7 verse\n[158.8s] 20. Would you read it with us? Verse 24.\n[162.0s] The Bible reads the Bible read. And the\n[164.0s] 10 horns\n[166.0s] out sorry he said the fourth news shall\n[170.4s] be the fourth kingdom upon earth. So\n[172.6s] that is these are kingdoms. Verse 17 is\n[175.8s] very clear more than that beasts. These\n[179.0s] great four beasts which are four which\n[181.8s] are four are four kings are four kings\n[184.9s] which shall rise out of the earth. So\n[187.5s] this beast represent what? Kings.\n[191.2s] Kingdoms and kingdoms are led by kings.\n[194.7s] So when you look at this beast, these\n[197.8s] are four kingdoms and the Bible says\n[202.1s] they are the kingdoms that will be there\n[204.6s] in this earth and then after them being\n[207.7s] there then this one will come to what an\n[210.2s] end to an end. How many are listening to\n[212.4s] me? Let me see if you are with me. Are\n[215.0s] you sure we are with me? We thank God.\n[218.2s] So look Daniel 7 has gone to the wine\n[222.1s] time. Now the chapter 7 is the same as I\n[225.4s] will not be following these things\n[228.0s] consequentially or sequentially but you\n[231.8s] can grasp this. Now listen that\n[237.0s] uh these are the four kingdoms they are\n[241.1s] working diverse meaning they will not\n[243.8s] work at the same time. When one cometh,\n[247.4s] when it comes to an end, another one\n[249.6s] followth. Like that, like that, like\n[252.4s] that. Now Daniel says, \"They did not\n[254.8s] come at once, but they came diverse from\n[258.1s] each other.\" Hallelujah. Amen.\n[261.3s] Hallelujah church. Amen. Now these are\n[263.4s] the four kingdom. Now if you want to\n[266.1s] know where the world is, you go back to\n[269.2s] Daniel chapter 2 and Daniel chapter 7.\n[273.6s] And said we have been preaching these\n[275.5s] things\n[277.1s] but our churches don't understand that\n[279.8s] we never read last\n[282.7s] time on drugs because today many people\n[287.9s] learn that many\n[289.5s] people but this makes us and they are\n[292.3s] not getting the right treatment that\n[295.5s] they should come.\n[297.7s] Today I want us\n[300.4s] also\n[310.0s] coming like a lion\n[314.6s] organization lions eagle wings now with\n[319.2s] worry as I beheld many people who are\n[322.6s] suffering from I want to go very\n[325.6s] fast among many\n[328.4s] other now receiving this drugs and many\n[332.3s] people were worried\n[334.8s] that Kenyan faces HIV treatment crisis\n[338.1s] as only 6 months supply of ARV drugs\n[341.7s] remaining so many people have been\n[344.2s] worried that when there is no supply of\n[347.1s] these drugs what is the way forward or\n[350.5s] what is the solution we've learned that\n[352.7s] we have reached a time that we are going\n[355.0s] to They are the same. We see in Daniel\n[359.0s] chapter 2, Babylon is represented\n[362.0s] by gold. In Daniel chapter\n[365.6s] 7, Babylon is represented by what? Lion.\n[369.3s] Lion. So this is the first kingdom that\n[372.2s] never ruled the world that became the\n[375.2s] superpower. And all of you if you read\n[378.4s] the book of Daniel chapter one, you know\n[381.4s] that is\n[382.4s] Nebuchadnezzar that captured the people\n[385.0s] of God. and to Babylon. You know\n[388.7s] Jeremiah during his time is when these\n[391.8s] people were captured by God allowed\n[396.1s] because the people had opposed the s. So\n[398.6s] this is the first\n[400.1s] kingdom. You all know that lion is the\n[403.1s] king of the world the jungle. He is all\n[406.9s] powerful and it is said that it's\n[409.3s] powerful more than all animals. That is\n[412.5s] what\n[413.8s] is being known. So you all know in\n[418.1s] Daniel chapter 2 God is telling\n[422.6s] Nebuchadnezzar that you will be like\n[426.4s] God but you will come and go and another\n[430.9s] kingdom will follow you and the kingdom\n[433.6s] that will follow you will not be greater\n[436.6s] as you what are as you are. So that\n[440.3s] means Babylon was so much\n[442.9s] great. But the king of follow Babylon\n[446.9s] was not going to be great as\n[449.4s] what? How many are listening to me? That\n[452.1s] is why when you look at that Daniel\n[455.0s] chapter 2, you see the image there is\n[457.6s] gold and then followed by silver and\n[460.2s] then bronze and then iron. Then iron\n[462.9s] mixed with what?\n[465.2s] that it is shall be to down. Why? That\n[468.6s] after Babylon the economy will be going\n[471.8s] what? Down just as gold is the precious\n[476.4s] metal then followed by silver followed\n[479.5s] by bronze followed by iron. So that is\n[482.6s] how the economy will be\n[484.8s] depreciating. So there will be no\n[486.9s] appreciation as these kingdoms are\n[489.6s] working diverse from each other. The\n[493.0s] Bible says it will be\n[495.2s] what? Now if you read the book of the\n[497.8s] Bible Daniel in Revelation, then God's\n[500.6s] people cannot engage in politics. Number\n[502.9s] one, you cannot engage politics when\n[505.4s] somebody tells you that he will bring\n[507.8s] what you he bottom up. He will make the\n[513.0s] economy to be blew aart. Why? The Bible\n[516.6s] says after Babylon we will go to there\n[520.7s] which is silver and then we'll go to\n[522.8s] bronze and then we will go to iron that\n[525.8s] means economy will be what?\n[532.0s] So friends, let me tell you a vote of me\n[534.2s] will not be good. Even if you vote me,\n[537.4s] even if I leave preaching today and then\n[539.5s] you elect me to be a governor of this\n[541.4s] county, there's nothing I can do for\n[543.6s] you. Why? The Bible says that when the\n[547.0s] fourth kingdom will be working, it will\n[549.4s] be iron mixed with what?\n[552.2s] meaning the economy gone.\n[555.4s] I see people are quarreling. Our economy\n[557.7s] is bad. Our economy is bad. R is bad and\n[562.1s] people are being recruited into JC\n[564.1s] movements. The reason why you can join\n[566.9s] join JZ movement so that you may be able\n[569.7s] to fight for the economy is because you\n[572.1s] do not understand the Bible prophecies.\n[575.2s] Those who understand the Bible prophecy,\n[576.8s] he cannot be engaged in any movement.\n[580.1s] Why? because they know that the Bible is\n[583.3s] very clear that the kingdom if you\n[586.6s] wanted a good economy then you to live\n[588.5s] in the what in the Babylonian Empire and\n[591.8s] that is why those two of them who got\n[594.1s] Babylonian mind is going to the street\n[597.4s] to fight for\n[598.8s] the ina people are able to\n[603.0s] die personally my brother was killed and\n[606.6s] was buried fighting for the economy of\n[610.2s] this What is now bad but now is our\n[613.5s] economy good? Nothing. So those who have\n[616.7s] Babian minds will always fight for good\n[619.0s] economy. But those who are Christians\n[621.9s] indeed will not fight for the economy.\n[624.0s] Why? The Bible says that as we come from\n[627.8s] Babylon then the economy will be what?\n[630.7s] Depreciating like that\n[634.8s] toast was at least good. So if you\n[637.0s] wanted good economy maybe you would have\n[639.0s] lived in the time of what the departure\n[642.1s] and then during what this g at least it\n[646.2s] was bronze because in in Kenya year\n[648.7s] number one is being given gold medal\n[651.0s] number two silver medal number three\n[653.4s] bronze bronze and then number"

Uh song number 88 we are told that nothing can wash us. You know the washing is needed when uh a body is dirty so that the dirt is removed away and therefore that one is bringing us to a topic this uh uh this time uh about cleanliness. I know it is something something that we know and uh it is not something that uh I just need to define is when you know about cleanliness but God requires every child of his to be clean not just on the physical cleanness but in all aspects let's move to the book of uh third John and verse two third John quickly Okay, because we behind time. Uh the readers please we do quickly. Third John verse two. The Bible says the Bible says help. Yes. Be in health that is the physical and also your soul to also prosper. So this uh the the soul mental together with physical can never be separated. We can't say that I can just wash my body that is enough. No, you go deep and then you are cleansed from within and also from without. That is the topic that we want to tackle. Uh so that by the end of it we remind ourselves I know everyone here is clean but uh I think it is brought here. God has written it for us so that we be admonished each and every time to improve so that we be clean as clean as our father in heaven. Let's go to the book of Matthew chapter 5 and also verse 48. Matthew 5 verse 48. The Bible says yes may be there to Yes. Father in heaven. Yeah. We are reminded that we be perfect even as our father who is at he who is in heaven is also perfect. I don't think God is just clean physically. He's clean in all aspects. I don't think that we can find any dirt from our living father. So that is what is required of us. We are reminded that we need to be clean and clean in all aspect the soul mind together with the physical body. That's what we want to tackle very quickly and then we shall see how God uh has planned for us this evening. Thank you. Uh we are having the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 14 and then verse 40. Corinthians chapter 14 verse 40. It reads no time. Which book are you reading? 1 Corinthians 14:14. 14:14. Verse 14. Yes, sir. Amen. Let all things be done decently and in order. So, it means or it is bringing in our mind that our God is a God of order. And do you think cleanliness is in order? Yes. Do you think cleanliness is in order? Yes. And that is why God is reminding us and it is a whole topic in the child guidance. We are having so many things about cleanliness. God is saying that please you Israelites be very clean as I'm coming to pass there. I shall find uh your surroundings very clean so that you can also feel my presence with thee. Amen. So it is not just something that we know that we have we need not to be reminded of. So the the book of first Corinthians Paul is saying that everything must be in order and must be done decently. Amen. Amen. So that is the voice of the Lord. Uh so we are having uh what we are calling cleanliness and that's what we want to tackle. Book of Matthew 5:8 says that without being clean, without being pure, we shall not see God. Amen. And this is the time that we need to do uh the reformations. If I'm not clean in one way or the other, I need to be clean. Even my words, as Matthew records it, I I hope you are in the book of five. Matthew verse 8 says, yes, blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Our ultimate goal, what has brought us here, what is making us to adore God is that one time, one day we shall meet with our father and then we shall forget about everything, all the infirmities in this world and then we shall be very happy. Amen. Amen. I hope that is what is in you. All of us, we need to see God and we without being pure, we cannot see God. that is recorded in the book of Matthew 5:8 that those happy them are blessed are them that are pure for they shall see God. So it means that if you are not pure, you cannot see God. How can you be pure in your heart, in your soul and then you are not pure in the brain. Is it possible? Is it possible? No. No. Just talk to me. Is it possible? Can you be pure in your heart? You say that me I love God so much but you are dirty on the I mean on your body. You don't care whether you're going to sleep with the legs with the legs with mud. You don't care. Do you think God can be happy with us? No. So God needs us to be pure. So the purity that God is talking about here is it is entire it is bringing in what we call the soul to be pure, the mind and also the physical body. So for somebody to know that this person is pure or this person is clean, the human eye, what will people see from you? Yes. What can people see? Yes. So that they can say you talk to meh. You talk to me. What will people say? And then they depict that this person is clean. Yes. From behind there. Nvin, you've carried up your hand. Oh, okay. to maybe to I know that you know people will look at you the physical appearance your clothes your shoes your body itself the way you've you've kept your hair people shall say ah this person is a clean person is a clean man a clean woman or a clean child so that is not enough God requires much than that what you beyond what human beings can see a pure heart uh in this world people will say that ah Because Moses Alo is really helping people and is very genuine. This person I I I must think that he's very pure before the eyes of the Lord. But it is only the Lord who can read the heart, the heart. And therefore we are told that for us to be in a condition that we shall see our God, then we must be pure. The purity that God wants is all aspects, the mind, the soul and also our body. uh but today uh I want us to check uh on how we can take care of our bodies on how we can take care of our bodies. There are a lot of questions which were asked when you are having uh this the second lesson in the morning uh that was uh modesty. Somebody asked a lot of question some we asked a lot of questions but then we shall see how we answer some of these questions. Okay. nature. Uh when we are doing doing the book of uh I mean we are having the Bible, we are told more about nature and God in his cleverness, he he used nature to teach us more of these things. Uh just check nature. Just check nature. Nature is some all these things that God created. It is not man-made. Anything that God created we can term is that as nature something that natural we find them in all our surroundings. Look at the trees look at the I mean the plants the animals your surroundings even human beings we shall we are going to find that all these things that God created they are clean. Is that true? Is that true? And that is not enough. God made Adam to be in the garden of Ed. What was the work given to Adam? Yes. To take care of the environment. Taking care of the that garden so that he ensures that where he is is clean and that cleanness will keep Adam pure. We have talked about the mind, the I mean the soul, the mind and also the the physical. So God did not want to see things which are not uh well arranged. Everything was to be kept pure, kept clean. And that is what is God what that is what God is calling us to be today. God is clean. There's no question about that one. God is pure. So he needs pure people by the end of this journey to do what? To be victors together with Christ. So nature we seeing animals the way God had created them. It is only by our sin that we are making them to violate the nature or violate the laws of of God. So we finding that uh as God made Adam to be or gave them the garden of Eden, he was the first teacher. He was the instructor. He gave them the work to do. The very first work that he gave them was to take care of their garden. And then we are finding nature. What was nature to Adam and Eve? That was a lesson book. Do you think it ceases to be a lesson book uh to Adam and Eve at their time? Is it can it be a lesson book to us today? Yes. Nature is our lesson book. So look at nature. It's a very big book. We need to learn about it and then God is going to be happy if we going we are ready to learn of nature. Then we are having uh the garden of Eden being the what? No, I just want us to talk. Uhhuh. That is the classroom. So God in his in his wisdom, he knew that these things will help us to the end of the age. So we are also called upon today to learn from nature as our lesson lesson book and then we are put here to call other people who are who have violated the law together with us to improve. What I just want you to check today is clean and know that we are all clean. It is not that we are not clean but we are all clean but then God needs us to improve on the cleanness in all aspects so that we are able to see him when he's coming the second time. Uh let's go to the book of uh Christ object lesson quickly. Uh if you are there page 348 paragraph one we are going to do paragraph one and paragraph two. The Bible says all should have human. Yes. All should have an intelligent knowledge. All is it some all should have is is God talking through sister white to animals. Do you think he's talking to animals here that all cows and elephants should have do you think he's going to is talking to animals? He's talking to us. Yes. Continue. All should have an intelligent knowledge. Yes. Of the human frame. Mhm. that they may keep their bodies in condition necessary to do the work of the lord that we should keep our bodies in a condition for the necessary work. So it means that there are some work which are not necessary but there there work which god approves to be necessary and therefore it is not Jesus who shall come down to make this body in a better condition to do the necessary work that God has given us. Yes. Continue. It says it says the physical life the physical life is to be carefully preserved is to be carefully preserved. Not carelessly should be carefully preserved. preserved and developed that through humanity and developed developed that through humanity yes divine nature may be revealed in its fullness. Just stop there. that when we are clean when the physical body is kept in the condition which is suitable for the necessary work then we are going to show the divinity of of God. Amen. Amen. So it is not something very little if we learn about it. Amen. M so you somebody cannot convince you even if she's a very small baby that you are very dirty you've not b for several days uh you are even you can get some some smell bad smell from you and then you want to convince a baby that I I I am very clean so such things are not bringing the divinity of God so God has has has given us the opportunity so that we can improve the physical call being to develop it. Amen. Continue says the relation of the physical organism the rel physical organism the spiritual life the spiritual life is one of the most important branches of education is one of the most important branches of education. So if there's something that we need to learn and also to teach our children according to the book of Deuteronomy chapter 6 is what? Cleanliness, the purity. One of the branches that God wants us to learn is to keep these bodies, the physical bodies in a condition very suitable for the necessary work. Continue. It should receive careful attention. It should receive the careful attention in the home and in the school. In the home and in the school all need to become acquainted with their physical structure. We need to become acquainted with our physical structure and those that control natural life. Those that control natural life the natural life. Amen. And therefore we uh you just going to read it but uh not now I'm not going to read it here. In the book of Micah chapter 5 and verses 5, we are having the laws of health given there. The eight shepherds and therefore I think we can mention them very fast. Uhhuh. We start with nutrition. No. Please talk to me. Exercise. Exercise. Water. Water. Sunshine. Uhhuh. Sunshine. Air. Rest. Yes. Yes. Trust in God. Uhhuh. There's something that you've passed. Are they eight? They're eight. Cindy dump friends. Are they eight? You and we've not follow them. That that just write new start and you'll have them. So we should have all these things. So anytime that we are not going to meet these doctors every day, we shall see even the physical body not very well. Is that true? miss exercise, miss water, the nutrition if it is bad, rest that we need to have, then even fresh air. Those are the eight doctors that the Lord has given us and in his wisdom he knew that we are going to meet these things and therefore he placed them before we were even created. Amen. Amen. Who was the last to be created? Yes. In God's creation, what was the last thing to be created? And then we entered the servantthood. Man, so man was created after everything had been placed rightly so that when we come we could enjoy it. God loves us so much and then you find somebody saying I cannot do exercise. I cannot go to the fresh air. No, no, no. Today I don't feel like taking a boa. No, no, no. Those are the eight doctors. If you want to be pure, we have to meet the eight doctors every day. And the standard is raised. And the standard is Christ himself. Amen. Amen. And especially this time when Christ is coming back. We are seeing things the way they are happening. We know that Christ very soon is coming back. We should not think that he's turning. Very soon he's coming back. And when he comes back, he tells us that he should find us when we are very ready to meet him in the clouds. Amen. Amen. Uh-huh. You are reading uh c I mean Christ object lesson. It says yes. Yes. He who remains in willing ignorance. Yes. He who remains in willing ignorance. Who is going to remain ignorance of the laws of his physical being of the laws of this physical being and he who violates them Uhhuh. through ignorance Yes. is sinning against God. Yes. We cannot separate physical, mental and spiritual. It is inseparable. It is inseparable. Those things three things cannot be separated. Uh I think God Frey can do this science very fast. Godfrey can you separate vitamins from vegetables? Quickly you tell us how we can do that one. Then we can see how we can separate soul uh mental the brain and also the physical. Can you do quickly go friend? It is separable. We cannot separate. We can never separate. So anyone who is remaining in ignorance of these things, we are told that you are violating the laws of God. And what is sin? Sin is transgression of the law. Sin is violation of the law of God. And therefore God is calling us to be clean. You cannot be clean in your mind if you are dirty on your physical body. I'm not talking about the dirtiness that you go to the garden and then you are you having some soil. No, I've not seen that one. You know what I mean by being dirty? You cannot tell us that you are very clean, the spiritual part of it, but your words which are coming out of your mouth are very unfilting. Amen. That's what I'm coming up with that cleanliness is next to godliness. So we we don't have any option. The only thing that we can do is to uh pull up our socks. There's no way we can separate spiritual and physical. Let's go to the book of No, you have not finished. Go to uh says do two. Yes. All should place themselves in the best possible relation to life. Yes. And health. Uhhuh. Our habits should be brought under the control of our mind. Yes. That is in itself under the control of God. Wait. So the uh our habits should be brought to the control of our mind. means that your mind must be very clear and that's why when we are meeting 5:5 God is telling us that we are I've given you the eight shepherds the seven shepherds and the eight principal men if you want your mind to be clear you have to meet these eight principle men and then if your mind is going to be clear therefore you your physical being is also to be clean to be clean aha Uh, continue. Know ye not? Know ye not, says the apostle Paul. Yes. Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. Yes. Which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own. Amen. For ye are bought with a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and your spirit which are gods. Amen. So you you are not your own. Amen. Amen. So you just have to you you have no option. God says that you have to be clean. That is full stop. Period. to him. Amen. Amen. So that is what God wants requires of us. And it is not just body. It is the the spiritual and also the the physical. We must be clean. The standard must be raised. I've not said that some people we are not clean. But I think you are getting what I'm the Lord is speaking to us this evening. Are you getting it? Yeah. Yes. We need to be clean. Just the way you are clean. I'm seeing a lot is very clean here. Look even the shoes and the socks is very clean. is saw coming. And then we are now told what man cannot see in you who which the Lord the only father in heaven can see must also be clean to be reflected out from your physical body. That is 1 Corinthians 6 19- 20. Knowing know ye not that your body is the temple of the living father. You are not your own. You are just given your bodies to take care of them. Some of us who are parents here, even your children are not your own. They are bought at a price. We are bought at a price. So if you are told to come and take care of somebody's I mean uh homestead, are you the owner of that homestead? Are you the owner of that home? You're just taking care and you have to abide by the rules that are in that homestead. Amen. So that is what God has shown us that we have to take care of these bodies. Uh-huh. Move to the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 3 16 and 17. I know they are very familiar books but now God wants us to raise the standard. Uhhuh. 16 17. The Bible says it says Mhm. shall go destroy. Amen. So what God requires of us is holiness. The holiness of our father which are in heaven is what is required of us. And you cannot be holy when you cannot take care of the physical body that you are given. Let's go to the book of child guidance. Child guidance page 106. Page 106. If you're there, please we starting from paragraph one. Just some few lines. I'll tell you. Okay, let me read it from here. God is particular. The Lord commanded the children of Israel to wash their clothes and put away all impurities from their encampment. Lest in passing, lest in passing by he should see their uncleanness. Amen. Amen. And people sleeping or you are busy recording. That is child guardians page 106 and paragraph one. I've just read the first lines there that God is particular. God is not a God of Job. God is not a God of justesting. He has said it and that is the end of it. that it says that the children of Israel where you are staying your encampment must be clean any impurity must not be found within your encampment because when I'm coming to pass I should not see your uncleanliness and I don't think God can pass where things are filthy and unclean uh when you move down there paragraph two towards the end it says uh where it begins the sentence that begins with God has given you the work. Are you there? You can project it. And then Uh-huh. paragraph 2, page 106, paragraph 2 towards the end, just in the middle there. Have you seen it? Ah, can you read it? God has given us a work of educating your children in these lines. Uhhuh. Yes. Amen. So the habit of cleanliness is a spiritual lesson. It is uplifting us to our father which are in heaven. So we don't have shortcut Christians. However much we can read all these things we might know all these through truths and then we don't keep ourselves clean physical spiritual and mental then we are going to miss heaven. We are going to miss the point. So God says that he has given us a work. Imagine you have been given a work those people are employed in whichever way self-employment you have some work to do and then when you go to your work you are just seated do you think the employer will be so much happy with you do you think he will be happy with you will show the cause why even to yourself if you are having some work to do and you just feel that you want to rest you don't want to work you will you shall show the cause why you have not done So God is calling us and he has told us he's not pestering us is commanding us. It is a command that he has given us a work and you cannot teach or train or educate the young ones if you don't have the if you have not prepared for the lessons. Amen. So it means that we have to uplift the standards so that we teach these young ones, the purity, the cleanliness, the orderliness that God wants us to have. Uhhuh. Remember he said he told the Israelites, please in your encampment make sure that everything is in order. Thank you. Just continue page 106 paragraph 4. We read it. It says clean. Yes, it's a British state. Paragraph four. Cleanliness should become second nature. Okay, read it. Okay. And cleanness in the homestead. Yes. Even in babyhood, right direction should be given to the minds and habits of children. Mhm. Show that there are three less in body or objection to God. Yes. Teach them to eat in a clean manner. That these habits may become second nature to them. Mhm. Impunity will be despised as it should. Amen. So God has given us a work and he's telling us that we should uh I mean nature or cleanness is the it becomes the second nature. We we have the first nature. Look at how God created everything. Look at how he has placed everything that he created and in its perfect way we can see that God indeed is a clean God is a holy God. And then he's telling us because we were to we were to take care of this nature that we are given here then we need now to do the work which we were given by our father. And now he's saying that cleanliness the way we are pleasing things be it now man-made or the natural things that we found uh that God had created for us must be in order and must be decently arranged and everything must be done correctly. And he says that this one is now the second nature that we teach our children that uncleanness in the home is a great mistake. How many think that when you go to heaven, we shall find things not orderly arranged there? I don't think we we can have that mind at some corners. You know when you were young, you were told that go and sweep and because you are very tired, you want to go play, you just sweep where people see. Just sweep where people see. But God says must be well done. We have to teach our children if they are given work to clean the house they should move at all the corners so that the house is left clean. They are told to bathe they they bathe well from the hair to the toe. So it is our work. It is our work uh so that we educate them. Oh that how that all will understand that these small duties are not to be neglected. Uh so it is it is a proper uh I mean it is a it is very convenient that we we are given the topic cleanliness. Uh my my colleague was teaching us about health. uh were checking about all these things but remember the diseases here I I heard him saying that diseases is equal to the violation of sin all the all the diseases and majorly the 99% is brought because of our how we eat nutrition it is taking much a bigger percentage so not just we are taking boa we are reformers but how are you taking these fruits are they washed Are they cleaned? So that we avoid the diseases that can be brought by uncleanliness. God says that uncleanliness is not correct in the homestead. Uh-huh. I'm having 7 minutes. Okay, 10 minutes. Uh-huh. We continue. Teach love for cleanliness and hatred of that. I'm in 107 paragraph 2. Teach love for cleanliness and hatred for that. I just want us as God is speaking to us this evening to check wherever we are in our domeies at back at home wherever we are here in the compound if God was talking to the Israelites that make sure that your encampment is clean so that when I come to pass I don't see your uncleanness so let's check wherever you are where you are seated there let us check have we have we reached the standard don't answer God wants us to be clean. So he says that teach love for cleanliness and hatred of dirt. You should cultivate a love for neatness and strict cleanness. If a lawyer is clean, let us not say that a lawyer is very strict. Hey Please mark me right because I know you are also all of us here we are struggling so that we reach the standard which is Christ. She's very clean. We also need to be clean in our hearts. in our mind, in our soul, so that we are we are capable of meeting Christ when he's coming the second time. He's the one who has said it. He says that you should cultivate a love for neatness and strict cleanliness. Cleanliness is not left for the brown people, for the lighted people. Even as dark as I am, I need to be clean. I'm very happy that I am dark. So I I don't want to hide my dirtiness within myself here. We need to be clean both in all aspects, mind, soul and body. Amen. Amen. I we continue. I'm having just around 8 minutes. Dress your children simply and plainly. Let their clothes be made of durable material. Keep them sweet and clean. Amen. Meaning that God that thing is put in us is only that we neglect it because the devil has brought us a lot of things that are not right with our mind. So it means that something is wrong. If the wire, if you are having some short circuited wires, we are not going to have light. Amen. And Jesus says that is the light. Amen. Amen. Good. Uhhuh. Teach them to hate anything like that and really will you teach a child to hate that and any filthy thing. If you can just find will you teach a child? So you give what you have. I'm just concluding. Uhhuh. Go to paragraph uh paragraph I mean 108 paragraph one quickly. Every form it say every form of uncleanness tends to decease. Amen. Leave it there. every form of uncleanliness. Believe that you are unclean in your spirit. You are unclean in your the the brain or the physical. It says that it is it tends to disease. It is tending to decease to the extent that even my teeth is their problem to me. When you sit next to your neighbor, people are just throwing their their noses. Is that happening with us? So that one might be because we have not brushed them well. We are not taking care of them well or we don't know how to brush or something is wrong in the in the stomach that bad breath and who is coming to work it out for you. Jesus has said that we should not neglect this duty. Very important. Look at the the the shoes. Uh we put on our shoes. We are uh we are having the paspiration. Somebody asked about the socks. Socks is helping in that. We are told that we sweat each and every time we do what? We do sweat when we are working. We are sweating. That's why when we put on our clothes and especially the long sleeved and we are having the long crosses, they are absorbed. Uh the sweat is absorbed by that the clothes. Then you remove them, they washed. Isn't it? Is that true? Yeah. Now you are having your so you are having your shoes without socks. You'll just find that it is smelling at a time. I've not said it is very it is sin to put your shoes without socks but it will give you easy time maybe you are at home you can see what you're doing but now when you have you're going to before God please just do it so that it helps you it will it will even control this issue of you remove your shoes and then people start saying ah something bad something bad amen it is very easy easier to wash the socks than to wash the the shoes amen I hope I hope we are all there my time is up. Is it up? Uhhuh. Personal cleanliness essential to health. How many of us here will not want to be healthy? When we was we began with the book of third John verse 2 that I brethren I just need your help both in the soul and also in the the physical. If someone is struggling so much so that we be healthy, what about yourselves? We take upon upon this one so that we be very clean. I want us to conclude with this paragraph. It is important also that the clothing be kept clean. The garments worn absorb the waste. That one I've explained. It is very true. It is in writing. The waste matters that passes off through the pores. If they are not frequently changed and washed, the impurities will be reabsorbed. Question. God in his wisdom, he saw it very wise that we he has given us food to eat. Genesis 1:29. Is that true? Then this one shall be your food. We know the food that God gave us. He know very well that after eating uh after eating and the good food is used in the system, there are some waste that must be removed. Is that true? And he has given us the medium in which the waste products are removed from our our bodies. What are they? First change the mediums where waste products are removed from our bodies. One the skin. Uhhuh. Yes. Kidney the l give us the fourth one. No this class should be balance when you are teachers are just okay. Give us one. The liver. The last one. The the pies. Uhhuh. Which one is the largest amongst the liver? Should it be taken care of? Yes. Should it be taken care of? Amen. Ah, thank you. So God in his wisdom, he knew very well that we are going to uh to to sweat much of the time when we are doing our work. So that skin must be well taken care of. If it is not well taken care of, you are just repeating repeating your clothes. You've uh you've worked with these ones today, tomorrow you repeat them, you repeat them. That is that is very normal with us. Huh? It is very normal. We go to the garden. This one is for the garden. I just keep them. And others are also coming back to sleep with them during the night. We are told that those impurities they going back to the system. They reabsorbed in the system. And what is that is equal to the disease which is equal to the death. We don't want to die like that. And that one alone is not very is not making heavens to be happy. I'm finishing alloy. Read with me paragraph 2 109. It says, I have also seen children's bed. Uhhuh. In such a condition that the fall poisonous order constantly rise from them was to be undurable. Keep everything the eyes of the children rest upon and that comes in contact with the body night or day clean and wholesome. M this will be one means of educating them to choose the cleanly and the pure. Let the sleeping room of your children be neat. However destitute it may be of expensive furniture. Amen. So we are told that we need to anything that the the children are going to lay their eyes on is cleanliness. Nothing less, nothing more. Uh that there are some rooms in our homes whereby when you get into the rooms where children are sleeping, you'll get that bad. God says that is it is not very healthy for the children. I know that there are some children who are still bedwing. Please as a parent you are supposed to take care of the that one. If it is washing every day wash it but you see how these children are helped to stop bedwetting. Maintain a proper balance. Cleanliness and order are Christian duties. May God really help us. I know that uh I was late by 15 minutes but it's okay we have to check time but God says that we have to maintain cleanliness for us to see God we must be clean so that you also uh I mean if we become medical missionaries all of us without making barriers that we we are evangelist these people are medical missionaries please we might we mingle these things so that we take the message you cannot be an evangelist and you are you cannot keep the cleanness. You cannot be a medical missionary but back at home when people are not seeing you, you are very dirty. So the mind must be washed, the soul must be washed and also our physical body must be pure so that we see God when he's coming in his second time in Jesus name we pray. So I think questions uh we shall tackle them in the next lesson. Let us pray. Lord our father in heaven. It is true that cleanliness is a very small topic that we might think so but we found that it entails a lot. We pray that you may forgive us in whichever way we've gone against thy will. And it is a high time that we begin with this small things so that we can reach greater things. It is you who call your disciples that they should be given the power to defeat all the devils. One of the devils which is catching up with us is uncleanliness. May you help us Lord so that we become clean in all aspects are waiting for your second kingdom. Thank you for the session that is passed and all the sessions that had passed in the morning and even the ones which are left. May you lead us through your holy spirit in the name of Jesus I pray. Amen. Thank you.",
        "timestamped_transcript": "[0.1s] catching up with us. Uh we learned from\n[2.8s] the Bible and also we learned from the\n[4.6s] SOP and I hope God has really blessed\n[7.3s] us. Uh song number\n[10.1s] 88 we are told that nothing can wash us.\n[14.1s] You know the washing is needed when uh a\n[17.6s] body is dirty so that the dirt is\n[20.2s] removed away and therefore that one is\n[22.4s] bringing us to a topic this uh uh this\n[25.8s] time uh about cleanliness.\n[29.0s] I know it is\n[31.2s] something something that we know and uh\n[35.4s] it is not something that uh I just need\n[37.5s] to define is when you know about\n[39.7s] cleanliness but God requires every child\n[43.1s] of his to be\n[44.7s] clean not just on the physical cleanness\n[49.4s] but in all aspects let's move to the\n[52.6s] book of uh third John and verse two\n[57.1s] third John quickly Okay, because we\n[59.1s] behind time. Uh the readers please we do\n[62.8s] quickly. Third\n[64.7s] John verse two. The Bible says\n[70.2s] the Bible\n[75.4s] says help.\n[79.6s] Yes. Be in health that is the physical\n[83.6s] and also your soul to also prosper. So\n[87.9s] this uh the the soul mental together\n[91.2s] with physical can never be separated. We\n[94.4s] can't say that I can just wash my body\n[96.6s] that is enough. No, you go deep and then\n[99.5s] you are cleansed from within and also\n[101.8s] from without. That is the topic that we\n[103.9s] want to tackle. Uh so that by the end of\n[106.9s] it we remind ourselves I know everyone\n[109.0s] here is clean but uh I think it is\n[112.7s] brought here. God has written it for us\n[115.0s] so that we be admonished each and every\n[117.4s] time to improve so that we be clean as\n[121.2s] clean as our father in heaven. Let's go\n[123.6s] to the book of Matthew chapter 5 and\n[125.9s] also verse\n[127.4s] 48. Matthew 5 verse 48. The Bible says\n[134.0s] yes\n[137.0s] may be there to Yes. Father in heaven.\n[141.8s] Yeah. We are reminded that we be perfect\n[144.2s] even as our father who is at he who is\n[147.4s] in heaven is also perfect. I don't think\n[150.0s] God is just clean physically. He's clean\n[153.0s] in all aspects. I don't think that we\n[155.5s] can find any dirt from our living\n[157.8s] father. So that is what is required of\n[160.0s] us. We are reminded that we need to be\n[162.6s] clean and clean in all aspect the soul\n[165.9s] mind together with the physical body.\n[168.7s] That's what we want to tackle very\n[170.3s] quickly and then we shall see how God uh\n[174.0s] has planned for us this evening. Thank\n[176.5s] you. Uh we are having the book of 1\n[179.6s] Corinthians chapter 14 and then verse\n[182.0s] 40. Corinthians chapter 14 verse\n[187.2s] 40. It reads\n[190.6s] no time.\n[192.9s] Which book are you reading? 1\n[194.2s] Corinthians 14:14.\n[196.5s] 14:14.\n[198.1s] Verse 14. Yes, sir.\n[202.1s] Amen. Let all things be done decently\n[205.6s] and in order. So, it means or it is\n[208.7s] bringing in our mind that our God is a\n[211.2s] God of order. And do you think\n[214.2s] cleanliness is in order?\n[216.9s] Yes. Do you think cleanliness is in\n[218.7s] order? Yes. And that is why God is\n[221.1s] reminding us and it is a whole topic\n[223.7s] in the child guidance. We are having so\n[226.8s] many things about cleanliness. God is\n[228.9s] saying that please you Israelites be\n[231.0s] very clean as I'm coming to pass there.\n[233.5s] I shall find uh your surroundings very\n[236.5s] clean so that you can also feel my\n[239.7s] presence with thee. Amen. So it is not\n[243.0s] just something that we know that we have\n[245.8s] we need not to be reminded of. So the\n[248.2s] the book of first Corinthians Paul is\n[250.6s] saying that everything must be in order\n[254.5s] and must be done decently. Amen. Amen.\n[258.4s] So that is the voice of the Lord. Uh so\n[261.0s] we are having uh what we are calling\n[263.1s] cleanliness and that's what we want to\n[265.1s] tackle. Book of Matthew 5:8 says that\n[268.7s] without being clean, without being pure,\n[271.8s] we shall not see God. Amen. And this is\n[273.9s] the time that we need to do uh the\n[276.7s] reformations. If I'm not clean in one\n[279.0s] way or the other, I need to be clean.\n[281.8s] Even my words, as Matthew records it, I\n[284.6s] I hope you are in the book of five.\n[287.0s] Matthew verse 8\n[289.7s] says, yes,\n[292.6s] blessed are the pure in heart, for they\n[295.4s] shall see God. Our ultimate goal, what\n[298.9s] has brought us here, what is making us\n[301.4s] to adore God is that one time, one day\n[304.5s] we shall meet with our father and then\n[307.2s] we shall forget about everything, all\n[309.5s] the infirmities in this world and then\n[311.6s] we shall be very happy. Amen. Amen. I\n[313.8s] hope that is what is in you. All of us,\n[316.2s] we need to see God and we without being\n[319.0s] pure, we cannot see God. that is\n[321.4s] recorded in the book of Matthew 5:8 that\n[325.1s] those happy them are blessed are them\n[327.8s] that are pure for they shall see God. So\n[331.5s] it means that if you are not pure, you\n[333.4s] cannot see God. How can you be pure in\n[337.0s] your heart, in your soul and then you\n[339.2s] are not pure in the brain. Is it\n[341.4s] possible?\n[343.0s] Is it possible? No. No. Just talk to me.\n[345.8s] Is it possible? Can you be pure in your\n[348.7s] heart? You say that me I love God so\n[350.5s] much but you are dirty on the I mean on\n[353.7s] your body. You don't care whether you're\n[357.1s] going to sleep with the legs with the\n[359.4s] legs with mud. You don't care. Do you\n[361.4s] think God can be happy with us? No. So\n[364.1s] God needs us to be pure. So the purity\n[366.0s] that God is talking about here is it is\n[368.5s] entire it\n[370.0s] is bringing in what we call the soul to\n[373.0s] be pure, the mind and also the physical\n[375.7s] body. So for somebody to know that this\n[378.2s] person is pure or this person is clean,\n[381.6s] the human eye, what will people see from\n[385.6s] you? Yes. What can people see?\n[390.2s] Yes. So that they can\n[401.1s] say you talk to\n[403.2s] meh. You talk to me. What will people\n[405.9s] say? And then they depict that this\n[407.6s] person is\n[409.6s] clean. Yes. From behind there.\n[412.9s] Nvin, you've carried up your hand.\n[416.4s] Oh, okay. to maybe to I know that you\n[419.7s] know people will look at you the\n[421.8s] physical appearance your clothes your\n[424.8s] shoes your body itself the way you've\n[427.5s] you've kept your hair people shall say\n[429.5s] ah this person is a clean person is a\n[432.9s] clean man a clean woman or a clean child\n[436.1s] so that is not enough God requires much\n[438.6s] than that what you beyond what human\n[441.1s] beings can see a pure heart uh in this\n[445.0s] world people will say that ah Because\n[447.3s] Moses Alo is really helping people and\n[449.7s] is very genuine. This person I I I must\n[452.6s] think that he's very pure before the\n[453.9s] eyes of the Lord. But it is only the\n[456.4s] Lord who can read the heart, the heart.\n[459.0s] And therefore we are told that for us to\n[461.4s] be in a condition that we shall see our\n[463.6s] God, then we must be pure. The purity\n[467.0s] that God wants is all aspects, the mind,\n[471.8s] the soul and also our body. uh but today\n[475.7s] uh I want us to check uh on how we can\n[478.9s] take care of our bodies on how we can\n[481.8s] take care of our bodies. There are a lot\n[483.6s] of questions which were asked when you\n[485.0s] are having uh this the second lesson in\n[488.5s] the morning\n[490.3s] uh that was uh\n[493.9s] modesty. Somebody asked a lot of\n[495.9s] question some we asked a lot of\n[497.8s] questions but then we shall see how we\n[500.6s] answer some of these questions. Okay.\n[503.8s] nature. Uh when we are doing doing the\n[506.3s] book of uh I mean we are having the\n[508.3s] Bible, we are told more about nature and\n[512.0s] God in his cleverness, he he used nature\n[516.3s] to teach us more of these things. Uh\n[520.2s] just check\n[521.6s] nature. Just check nature. Nature is\n[525.1s] some all these things that God created.\n[527.6s] It is not man-made. Anything that God\n[530.6s] created we can term is that as nature\n[533.1s] something that natural we find them in\n[536.2s] all our surroundings. Look at the\n[538.9s] trees look at the I mean the plants the\n[542.2s] animals your surroundings even human\n[545.2s] beings we shall we are going to find\n[548.1s] that all these things that God created\n[551.0s] they are clean. Is that true? Is that\n[554.8s] true? And that is not enough. God made\n[558.0s] Adam to be in the garden of Ed. What was\n[560.9s] the work given to\n[563.3s] Adam? Yes. To take care of the\n[567.7s] environment. Taking care of the that\n[569.6s] garden so that he ensures that where he\n[573.0s] is is\n[574.2s] clean and that cleanness will keep Adam\n[578.9s] pure. We have talked about the mind, the\n[581.9s] I mean the soul, the mind and also the\n[584.0s] the physical. So God did not want to see\n[586.7s] things which are not uh well arranged.\n[589.8s] Everything was to be kept pure, kept\n[593.1s] clean. And that is what is God what that\n[595.8s] is what God is calling us to be today.\n[599.1s] God is clean. There's no question about\n[601.6s] that one. God is pure. So he needs pure\n[604.5s] people by the end of this journey to do\n[607.4s] what? To be victors together with\n[610.0s] Christ. So nature we seeing animals the\n[612.9s] way God had created them. It is only by\n[615.4s] our sin that we are making them to\n[618.2s] violate the nature or violate the laws\n[621.2s] of of God. So we finding that uh as God\n[626.2s] made Adam to be or gave them the garden\n[628.8s] of Eden, he was the first teacher. He\n[631.9s] was the instructor. He gave them the\n[634.3s] work to do. The very first work that he\n[636.6s] gave them was to take care of their\n[638.7s] garden. And then we are finding nature.\n[642.1s] What was nature to Adam and Eve?\n[645.6s] That was a lesson book. Do you think it\n[648.1s] ceases to be a lesson book uh to Adam\n[650.6s] and Eve at their time? Is it can it be a\n[653.6s] lesson book to us today? Yes. Nature is\n[657.1s] our lesson book. So look at nature. It's\n[660.6s] a very big book. We need to learn about\n[663.0s] it and then God is going to be happy if\n[665.5s] we going we are ready to learn of\n[667.8s] nature. Then we are having uh the garden\n[671.2s] of Eden being the\n[673.2s] what? No, I just want us to talk. Uhhuh.\n[677.0s] That is the\n[678.8s] classroom. So God in his in his wisdom,\n[683.0s] he knew that these things will help us\n[685.2s] to the end of the age.\n[690.2s] So we are also called upon today to\n[693.0s] learn from nature as our\n[696.8s] lesson lesson book and then we are put\n[700.6s] here to call other people who are who\n[703.5s] have violated the law together with us\n[705.9s] to improve. What I just want you to\n[708.2s] check today is clean and know that we\n[710.3s] are all clean. It is not that we are not\n[712.9s] clean but we are all clean but then God\n[715.2s] needs us to improve on the\n[718.4s] cleanness in all aspects so that we are\n[722.0s] able to see him when he's coming the\n[725.0s] second time. Uh let's go to the book of\n[727.7s] uh Christ object lesson quickly. Uh if\n[731.0s] you are there page\n[733.1s] 348 paragraph one we are going to do\n[735.7s] paragraph one and paragraph two.\n[740.2s] The Bible says\n[742.6s] all should have human.\n[748.0s] Yes. All should have an intelligent\n[750.2s] knowledge. All is it some all should\n[754.3s] have is is God talking through sister\n[757.5s] white to\n[759.3s] animals. Do you think he's talking to\n[761.4s] animals here that all cows and elephants\n[764.2s] should\n[765.2s] have do you think he's going to is\n[767.7s] talking to animals? He's talking to us.\n[770.4s] Yes. Continue. All should have an\n[773.8s] intelligent knowledge. Yes. Of the human\n[776.2s] frame. Mhm. that they may keep their\n[778.4s] bodies in condition necessary to do the\n[780.2s] work of the lord that we should keep our\n[783.3s] bodies in a condition for the necessary\n[786.7s] work. So it means that there are some\n[788.5s] work which are not necessary but there\n[791.0s] there work which god approves to be\n[793.2s] necessary and therefore it is not Jesus\n[795.7s] who shall come down to make this body in\n[798.0s] a better condition to do the necessary\n[801.1s] work that God has given us. Yes.\n[803.0s] Continue. It says it says the physical\n[805.6s] life the physical life is to be\n[807.8s] carefully preserved is to be carefully\n[810.6s] preserved. Not\n[812.8s] carelessly should be carefully\n[815.5s] preserved. preserved\n[817.9s] and developed that through humanity and\n[821.0s] developed developed that through\n[823.2s] humanity yes divine nature may be\n[825.4s] revealed in its fullness. Just stop\n[827.4s] there. that when we are clean when the\n[831.1s] physical body is kept in the condition\n[833.5s] which is suitable for the necessary work\n[836.4s] then we are going to show the divinity\n[839.9s] of of God. Amen. Amen. So it is not\n[843.2s] something very little if we learn about\n[845.6s] it. Amen. M so you somebody cannot\n[849.4s] convince you even if she's a very small\n[852.1s] baby that you are very dirty you've not\n[855.6s] b for several days uh you are even you\n[859.8s] can get some some smell bad smell from\n[862.2s] you and then you want to convince a baby\n[863.9s] that I I I am very clean so such things\n[867.0s] are not bringing the divinity of God so\n[869.8s] God has has has given us the opportunity\n[872.9s] so that we can improve the physical call\n[876.9s] being to develop it. Amen. Continue says\n[881.4s] the relation of the physical organism\n[883.5s] the rel physical organism the spiritual\n[886.4s] life the spiritual life is one of the\n[888.6s] most important branches of education is\n[891.0s] one of the most important branches of\n[894.5s] education. So if there's something that\n[896.3s] we need to learn and also to teach our\n[900.2s] children according to the book of\n[901.8s] Deuteronomy chapter 6 is what?\n[905.4s] Cleanliness, the\n[908.6s] purity. One of the branches that God\n[911.2s] wants us to learn is to keep these\n[913.8s] bodies, the physical bodies in a\n[916.2s] condition very suitable for the\n[919.0s] necessary work. Continue.\n[922.1s] It should receive careful attention. It\n[924.6s] should receive the careful attention in\n[928.2s] the home and in the school. In the home\n[929.8s] and in the school all need to become\n[931.6s] acquainted with their physical\n[933.1s] structure.\n[934.9s] We need to become acquainted with our\n[937.4s] physical structure and those that\n[939.6s] control natural life. Those that control\n[942.6s] natural life the natural life. Amen. And\n[945.4s] therefore we uh you just going to read\n[947.8s] it but uh not now I'm not going to read\n[950.1s] it here. In the book of Micah chapter 5\n[952.1s] and verses 5, we are having the laws of\n[954.7s] health given there. The eight shepherds\n[957.3s] and therefore I think we can mention\n[958.9s] them very fast. Uhhuh. We start with\n[961.8s] nutrition.\n[963.3s] No. Please talk to me. Exercise.\n[966.2s] Exercise. Water. Water.\n[969.6s] Sunshine.\n[971.5s] Uhhuh. Sunshine.\n[978.0s] Air. Rest.\n[982.6s] Yes.\n[984.6s] Yes. Trust in God. Uhhuh. There's\n[987.8s] something that you've passed. Are they\n[989.5s] eight? They're eight. Cindy dump\n[992.0s] friends. Are they eight? You and we've\n[993.8s] not follow them. That that just write\n[995.3s] new start and you'll have them. So we\n[997.4s] should have all these things. So anytime\n[999.3s] that we are not going to meet these\n[1000.8s] doctors every day, we shall see even the\n[1004.6s] physical body not very well. Is that\n[1007.2s] true? miss\n[1009.3s] exercise, miss water, the nutrition if\n[1013.1s] it is bad, rest that we need to have,\n[1016.7s] then even fresh air. Those are the eight\n[1019.5s] doctors that the Lord has given us and\n[1021.6s] in his wisdom he knew that we are going\n[1024.8s] to meet these things and therefore he\n[1026.5s] placed them before we were even created.\n[1029.3s] Amen. Amen. Who was the last to be\n[1032.6s] created? Yes. In God's creation, what\n[1036.2s] was the last thing to be created? And\n[1037.7s] then we entered the servantthood. Man,\n[1039.8s] so man was created after everything had\n[1042.2s] been placed rightly so that when we come\n[1045.0s] we could enjoy it. God loves us so much\n[1048.3s] and then you find somebody saying I\n[1050.1s] cannot do exercise. I cannot go to the\n[1052.9s] fresh air. No, no, no. Today I don't\n[1055.7s] feel like taking a boa. No, no, no.\n[1058.5s] Those are the eight doctors. If you want\n[1060.2s] to be pure, we have to meet the eight\n[1062.2s] doctors every day. And the standard is\n[1065.6s] raised. And the standard is Christ\n[1067.9s] himself. Amen. Amen. And especially this\n[1070.4s] time when Christ is coming back. We are\n[1072.8s] seeing things the way they are\n[1074.2s] happening. We know that Christ very soon\n[1076.3s] is coming back. We should not think that\n[1079.8s] he's turning. Very soon he's coming\n[1082.0s] back. And when he comes back, he tells\n[1084.8s] us that he should find us when we are\n[1086.6s] very ready to meet him in the clouds.\n[1088.8s] Amen. Amen. Uh-huh. You are reading uh c\n[1092.0s] I mean Christ object lesson. It says\n[1094.4s] yes. Yes. He who remains in willing\n[1096.0s] ignorance. Yes. He who remains in\n[1098.4s] willing ignorance. Who is going to\n[1100.4s] remain ignorance of the laws of his\n[1103.1s] physical being of the laws of this\n[1105.4s] physical being and he who violates them\n[1108.2s] Uhhuh. through ignorance Yes. is sinning\n[1110.6s] against God. Yes. We cannot separate\n[1114.2s] physical, mental and spiritual. It is\n[1118.4s] inseparable. It is inseparable. Those\n[1121.6s] things three things cannot be separated.\n[1124.7s] Uh I think God Frey can do this science\n[1126.8s] very fast. Godfrey can you separate\n[1129.9s] vitamins from vegetables? Quickly you\n[1131.8s] tell us how we can do that one. Then we\n[1133.3s] can see how we can separate soul uh\n[1136.8s] mental the brain and also the physical.\n[1139.0s] Can you do quickly go friend? It is\n[1141.4s] separable. We cannot separate. We can\n[1144.0s] never separate. So anyone who is\n[1146.6s] remaining in ignorance of these things,\n[1149.9s] we are told that you are violating the\n[1151.8s] laws of God. And what is sin? Sin is\n[1155.9s] transgression of the law. Sin is\n[1157.7s] violation of the law of God. And\n[1160.6s] therefore God is calling us to be clean.\n[1163.7s] You cannot be clean in your mind if you\n[1166.3s] are dirty on your physical body. I'm not\n[1169.7s] talking about the dirtiness that you go\n[1171.2s] to the garden and then you are you\n[1173.4s] having some soil. No, I've not seen that\n[1176.2s] one. You know what I mean by being\n[1177.4s] dirty? You cannot tell us that you are\n[1179.4s] very clean, the spiritual part of it,\n[1181.6s] but your words which are coming out of\n[1183.8s] your mouth are very unfilting. Amen.\n[1187.0s] That's what I'm coming up with that\n[1189.2s] cleanliness is next to godliness. So we\n[1193.5s] we don't have any option. The only thing\n[1196.4s] that we can do is to uh pull up our\n[1199.9s] socks. There's no way we can separate\n[1203.3s] spiritual and physical. Let's go to the\n[1206.8s] book of No, you have not finished. Go to\n[1209.3s] uh says do two. Yes. All should place\n[1211.8s] themselves in the best possible relation\n[1213.7s] to life. Yes. And health. Uhhuh. Our\n[1216.2s] habits should be brought under the\n[1217.8s] control of our mind. Yes. That is in\n[1219.7s] itself under the control of God. Wait.\n[1222.2s] So the uh our habits should be brought\n[1226.9s] to the control of our mind. means that\n[1229.7s] your mind must be very clear and that's\n[1232.2s] why when we are\n[1233.7s] meeting 5:5 God is telling us that we\n[1237.4s] are I've given you the eight\n[1240.2s] shepherds the seven shepherds and the\n[1242.6s] eight principal men if you want your\n[1246.1s] mind to be clear you have to meet these\n[1248.1s] eight principle men and then if your\n[1250.9s] mind is going to be clear therefore you\n[1253.5s] your physical being is also to be clean\n[1256.6s] to be clean aha Uh, continue.\n[1260.5s] Know ye not? Know ye not, says the\n[1262.8s] apostle Paul. Yes. Your body is the\n[1265.0s] temple of the Holy Ghost. Yes. Which is\n[1266.9s] in you, which you have of God, and you\n[1269.8s] are not your own. Amen. For ye are\n[1271.8s] bought with a price. Therefore, glorify\n[1273.9s] God in your body and your spirit which\n[1276.0s] are gods. Amen. So you you are not your\n[1279.2s] own. Amen. Amen. So you just have to you\n[1282.5s] you have no option. God says that you\n[1285.0s] have to be clean. That is full stop.\n[1287.0s] Period. to him. Amen. Amen. So that is\n[1289.8s] what God wants requires of us. And it is\n[1292.0s] not just body. It is the the spiritual\n[1295.8s] and also the the physical. We must be\n[1298.7s] clean. The standard must be raised. I've\n[1302.0s] not said that some people we are not\n[1303.8s] clean. But I think you are getting what\n[1305.9s] I'm the Lord is speaking to us this\n[1308.2s] evening. Are you getting it? Yeah. Yes.\n[1310.5s] We need to be clean. Just the way you\n[1312.0s] are clean. I'm seeing a lot is very\n[1313.4s] clean here. Look even the shoes and the\n[1315.7s] socks is very clean. is saw coming. And\n[1319.0s] then we are now told what man cannot see\n[1321.8s] in you who which the Lord the only\n[1324.7s] father in heaven can see must also be\n[1327.1s] clean to be reflected out from your\n[1330.5s] physical body. That is 1 Corinthians 6\n[1334.4s] 19- 20. Knowing know ye not that your\n[1338.5s] body is the temple of the living father.\n[1342.8s] You are not your own. You are just given\n[1345.4s] your bodies to take care of them. Some\n[1348.1s] of us who are parents here, even your\n[1350.0s] children are not your own. They are\n[1353.7s] bought at a price. We are bought at a\n[1356.6s] price. So if you are told to come and\n[1359.5s] take care of somebody's I mean uh\n[1362.6s] homestead, are you the owner of that\n[1364.7s] homestead? Are you the owner of that\n[1366.6s] home? You're just taking care and you\n[1369.4s] have to abide by the rules that are in\n[1372.6s] that homestead. Amen. So that is what\n[1375.0s] God has shown us that we have to take\n[1377.3s] care of these bodies. Uh-huh. Move to\n[1379.9s] the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 3 16\n[1382.4s] and 17. I know they are very familiar\n[1385.4s] books but now God wants us to raise the\n[1387.8s] standard. Uhhuh. 16 17. The Bible says\n[1396.5s] it\n[1401.5s] says Mhm.\n[1405.8s] shall go destroy. Amen.\n[1412.2s] So what God requires of us is\n[1415.7s] holiness. The holiness of our father\n[1418.6s] which are in heaven is what is required\n[1420.5s] of us. And you cannot be holy when you\n[1424.4s] cannot take care of the physical body\n[1427.0s] that you are given.\n[1431.4s] Let's go to the book of child guidance.\n[1434.0s] Child guidance page 106. Page\n[1438.0s] 106. If you're there, please we\n[1441.3s] starting from paragraph one. Just some\n[1444.2s] few lines. I'll tell you. Okay, let me\n[1446.8s] read it from here. God is particular.\n[1449.6s] The Lord commanded the children of\n[1451.0s] Israel to wash their clothes and put\n[1453.2s] away all impurities from their\n[1455.8s] encampment. Lest in passing, lest in\n[1459.0s] passing by he should see their\n[1461.2s] uncleanness.\n[1462.8s] Amen. Amen. And people sleeping or you\n[1467.0s] are busy recording. That is child\n[1468.5s] guardians page 106 and paragraph one.\n[1470.7s] I've just read the first lines there\n[1472.8s] that God is particular. God is not a God\n[1476.2s] of Job. God is not a God of justesting.\n[1479.1s] He has said it and that is the end of\n[1481.6s] it. that it says that the children of\n[1484.1s] Israel where you are staying your\n[1487.0s] encampment must be clean any impurity\n[1491.3s] must not be found within your encampment\n[1494.4s] because when I'm coming to pass I should\n[1497.2s] not see your\n[1499.2s] uncleanliness and I don't think God can\n[1501.2s] pass where things are filthy and unclean\n[1504.3s] uh when you move down there paragraph\n[1506.4s] two towards the end it says uh where it\n[1509.8s] begins the sentence that begins with God\n[1511.6s] has given you the work. Are you there?\n[1515.2s] You can project it. And then Uh-huh.\n[1518.2s] paragraph 2, page 106, paragraph 2\n[1521.1s] towards the end, just in the middle\n[1523.0s] there. Have you seen it? Ah, can you\n[1524.7s] read it?\n[1526.8s] God has given us a\n[1528.6s] work of educating your children in these\n[1533.1s] lines.\n[1534.9s] Uhhuh. Yes.\n[1537.6s] Amen. So the habit of cleanliness is a\n[1541.4s] spiritual lesson. It is uplifting us to\n[1545.4s] our father which are in heaven. So we\n[1548.6s] don't have shortcut Christians. However\n[1551.4s] much we can read all these things we\n[1553.0s] might know all these through truths and\n[1555.0s] then we don't keep ourselves\n[1557.5s] clean physical spiritual and mental then\n[1561.4s] we are going to miss heaven. We are\n[1563.2s] going to miss the point. So God says\n[1564.9s] that he has given us a work. Imagine you\n[1567.2s] have been given a work those people are\n[1569.0s] employed in whichever way\n[1570.4s] self-employment you have some work to do\n[1573.0s] and then when you go to your work you\n[1574.9s] are just seated do you think the\n[1577.2s] employer will be so much happy with you\n[1580.0s] do you think he will be happy with\n[1582.0s] you will show the cause why even to\n[1585.8s] yourself if you are having some work to\n[1587.8s] do and you just feel that you want to\n[1589.7s] rest you don't want to work you will you\n[1591.8s] shall show the\n[1593.6s] cause why you have not done So God is\n[1597.2s] calling us and he has told us he's not\n[1599.6s] pestering us is commanding us. It is a\n[1601.8s] command that he has given us a work and\n[1605.4s] you cannot teach or train or educate the\n[1608.6s] young ones if you don't have the if you\n[1611.7s] have not prepared for the lessons. Amen.\n[1613.8s] So it means that we have to uplift the\n[1616.9s] standards so that we teach these young\n[1619.4s] ones, the purity, the cleanliness, the\n[1623.4s] orderliness that God wants us to have.\n[1626.6s] Uhhuh. Remember he said he told the\n[1629.0s] Israelites, please in your encampment\n[1631.5s] make sure that everything is in order.\n[1634.6s] Thank you. Just continue page 106\n[1637.2s] paragraph 4. We read it. It says clean.\n[1642.1s] Yes, it's a British state. Paragraph\n[1644.8s] four. Cleanliness should become second\n[1647.8s] nature.\n[1650.2s] Okay, read it.\n[1654.1s] Okay. And cleanness in the homestead.\n[1658.0s] Yes.\n[1663.0s] Even in babyhood, right direction should\n[1665.8s] be given to the minds and habits of\n[1667.4s] children. Mhm. Show that there are three\n[1669.4s] less in body or objection to God. Yes.\n[1674.0s] Teach them to eat in a clean manner.\n[1678.5s] That these habits may become second\n[1680.1s] nature to them. Mhm. Impunity will be\n[1682.2s] despised as it should. Amen. So God has\n[1685.4s] given us a work and he's telling us that\n[1687.8s] we should uh I mean nature or cleanness\n[1691.7s] is the it becomes the second nature. We\n[1694.9s] we have the first nature. Look at how\n[1696.6s] God created everything. Look at how he\n[1698.9s] has placed everything that he created\n[1701.6s] and in its perfect way we can see that\n[1704.7s] God indeed is a clean God is a holy God.\n[1708.8s] And then he's telling us because we were\n[1710.6s] to we were to take care of this nature\n[1712.4s] that we are given here then we need now\n[1715.6s] to do the work which we were given by\n[1718.2s] our father. And now he's saying that\n[1720.6s] cleanliness the way we are pleasing\n[1722.9s] things be it now man-made or the natural\n[1725.5s] things that we found uh that God had\n[1727.9s] created for us must be in order and must\n[1731.4s] be decently arranged and everything must\n[1734.3s] be done correctly. And he says that this\n[1736.7s] one is now the second nature that we\n[1739.4s] teach our children that uncleanness in\n[1741.9s] the home is a great mistake.\n[1746.6s] How many think that when you go to\n[1748.6s] heaven, we shall find things not orderly\n[1751.0s] arranged\n[1752.7s] there? I don't think we we can have that\n[1761.7s] mind at some corners. You know when you\n[1764.7s] were young, you were told that go and\n[1766.2s] sweep and because you are very tired,\n[1767.5s] you want to go play, you just sweep\n[1769.8s] where people see. Just sweep where\n[1771.7s] people see. But God says must be well\n[1775.2s] done. We have to teach our children if\n[1777.4s] they are given work to clean the house\n[1781.0s] they should move at all the corners so\n[1783.7s] that the house is left clean. They are\n[1785.6s] told to bathe they they bathe well from\n[1788.7s] the hair to the toe. So it is our work.\n[1792.4s] It is our work uh so that we educate\n[1795.4s] them. Oh that how that all will\n[1799.4s] understand that these small duties are\n[1801.6s] not to be\n[1803.6s] neglected. Uh so it is it is a proper uh\n[1807.3s] I mean it is a it is very convenient\n[1809.3s] that we we are given the topic\n[1811.8s] cleanliness. Uh my my colleague was\n[1815.2s] teaching us about health. uh were\n[1817.9s] checking about all these things but\n[1819.4s] remember the diseases here I I heard him\n[1822.2s] saying that diseases is equal to the\n[1825.7s] violation of sin all the all the\n[1828.8s] diseases and majorly the\n[1831.6s] 99% is brought because of our how we eat\n[1836.3s] nutrition it is taking much a bigger\n[1839.2s] percentage so not just we are taking boa\n[1842.2s] we are reformers but how are you taking\n[1844.4s] these fruits are they washed\n[1847.8s] Are they\n[1849.2s] cleaned? So that we avoid the diseases\n[1852.0s] that can be brought by uncleanliness.\n[1854.4s] God says that uncleanliness is not\n[1857.3s] correct in the homestead. Uh-huh. I'm\n[1860.5s] having 7 minutes. Okay, 10 minutes.\n[1863.1s] Uh-huh. We continue. Teach love for\n[1865.9s] cleanliness and hatred of that. I'm in\n[1869.2s] 107 paragraph 2. Teach love for\n[1872.4s] cleanliness and hatred for that. I just\n[1875.7s] want us as God is speaking to us this\n[1877.6s] evening to check wherever we are in our\n[1880.6s] domeies at back at home wherever we are\n[1883.3s] here in the compound if God was talking\n[1886.4s] to the Israelites that make sure that\n[1888.2s] your encampment is clean so that when I\n[1891.2s] come to pass I don't see your\n[1895.0s] uncleanness so let's check wherever you\n[1898.2s] are where you are seated there let us\n[1900.7s] check have we have we reached the\n[1902.6s] standard don't answer God wants us to be\n[1906.5s] clean. So he says that teach love for\n[1909.0s] cleanliness and hatred of dirt. You\n[1912.6s] should cultivate a love for neatness and\n[1915.6s] strict cleanness. If a lawyer is clean,\n[1920.1s] let us not say that a lawyer is very\n[1922.3s] strict. Hey\n[1940.6s] Please mark me\n[1946.2s] right because I know you are also all of\n[1949.1s] us here we are struggling so that we\n[1951.5s] reach the standard which is Christ.\n[1966.6s] She's very\n[1982.5s] clean. We also need to be clean in our\n[1985.8s] hearts.\n[1987.3s] in our mind, in our soul, so that we are\n[1991.3s] we are capable of meeting Christ when\n[1993.4s] he's coming the second time. He's the\n[1994.8s] one who has said it. He says that you\n[1997.3s] should cultivate a love for neatness and\n[2000.1s] strict cleanliness. Cleanliness is not\n[2003.0s] left for the brown people, for the\n[2005.2s] lighted people. Even as dark as I am, I\n[2008.9s] need to be clean. I'm very happy that I\n[2011.4s] am dark. So I I don't want to hide my\n[2014.0s] dirtiness within myself here. We need to\n[2016.5s] be clean both in all aspects, mind,\n[2022.0s] soul and body. Amen. Amen. I we\n[2026.3s] continue. I'm having just around 8\n[2028.4s] minutes. Dress your children simply and\n[2031.0s] plainly. Let their clothes be made of\n[2033.7s] durable material. Keep them sweet and\n[2036.6s] clean.\n[2057.5s] Amen. Meaning that God that thing is put\n[2060.6s] in us is only that we neglect it because\n[2063.1s] the devil has brought us a lot of things\n[2066.0s] that are not right with our mind. So it\n[2068.7s] means that something is wrong. If the\n[2070.7s] wire, if you are having some short\n[2072.9s] circuited wires, we are not going to\n[2075.0s] have light. Amen. And Jesus says that is\n[2077.0s] the light. Amen. Amen. Good. Uhhuh.\n[2080.3s] Teach them to hate anything like that\n[2083.8s] and really will you teach a child to\n[2087.1s] hate that and any filthy thing. If you\n[2091.8s] can just\n[2098.8s] find will you teach a\n[2101.6s] child? So you give what you have. I'm\n[2104.6s] just concluding. Uhhuh. Go to paragraph\n[2108.4s] uh paragraph I mean 108 paragraph one\n[2111.0s] quickly. Every form it say every form of\n[2113.5s] uncleanness tends to decease. Amen.\n[2115.9s] Leave it there. every form of\n[2118.6s] uncleanliness. Believe that you are\n[2120.4s] unclean in your\n[2121.8s] spirit. You are unclean in your the the\n[2125.1s] brain or the physical. It says that it\n[2129.1s] is it tends to disease. It is tending to\n[2142.0s] decease to the extent that even my teeth\n[2145.1s] is their problem to me. When you sit\n[2148.5s] next to your\n[2150.3s] neighbor, people are just throwing their\n[2153.0s] their\n[2154.4s] noses. Is that happening with us?\n[2157.8s] So that one might be because we have not\n[2160.0s] brushed them well. We are not taking\n[2161.8s] care of them well or we don't know how\n[2164.5s] to brush or something is wrong in the in\n[2167.4s] the stomach that bad breath and who is\n[2171.0s] coming to work it out for you. Jesus has\n[2174.1s] said that we should not neglect this\n[2176.3s] duty. Very important. Look at the the\n[2179.4s] the shoes. Uh we put on our shoes. We\n[2182.5s] are uh we are having the paspiration.\n[2185.0s] Somebody asked about the socks. Socks is\n[2187.3s] helping in that. We are told that we\n[2189.8s] sweat each and every time we do what? We\n[2192.0s] do sweat when we are working. We are\n[2193.5s] sweating. That's why when we put on our\n[2195.5s] clothes and especially the long sleeved\n[2197.4s] and we are having the long crosses, they\n[2199.3s] are\n[2200.4s] absorbed. Uh the sweat is absorbed by\n[2203.3s] that the clothes. Then you remove them,\n[2205.6s] they washed. Isn't it? Is that true?\n[2209.0s] Yeah. Now you are having your so you are\n[2211.5s] having your shoes without socks. You'll\n[2214.3s] just find that it is smelling at a time.\n[2216.8s] I've not said it is very it is sin to\n[2218.9s] put your shoes without socks but it will\n[2221.3s] give you easy time maybe you are at home\n[2223.5s] you can see what you're doing but now\n[2225.0s] when you have you're going to before God\n[2227.2s] please just do it so that it helps you\n[2230.2s] it will it will even control this issue\n[2232.5s] of you remove your shoes and then people\n[2234.4s] start saying ah something bad something\n[2236.3s] bad amen it is very easy easier to wash\n[2239.4s] the socks than to wash the the shoes\n[2242.1s] amen I hope I hope we are all there my\n[2244.9s] time is up. Is it up? Uhhuh. Personal\n[2248.1s] cleanliness essential to health. How\n[2251.0s] many of us here will not want to be\n[2252.7s] healthy? When we was we began with the\n[2255.3s] book of third John verse 2 that I\n[2259.8s] brethren I just need your help both in\n[2263.1s] the soul and also in the the physical.\n[2265.6s] If someone is struggling so much so that\n[2267.5s] we be healthy, what about yourselves? We\n[2270.6s] take upon upon this one so that we be\n[2273.0s] very clean. I want us to conclude with\n[2275.5s] this paragraph. It is important also\n[2278.8s] that the clothing be kept clean. The\n[2281.4s] garments worn absorb the waste. That one\n[2283.8s] I've explained. It is very true. It is\n[2285.5s] in writing. The waste matters that\n[2288.0s] passes off through the pores. If they\n[2291.4s] are not frequently changed and washed,\n[2294.9s] the impurities will be reabsorbed.\n[2297.9s] Question.\n[2299.6s] God in his wisdom, he saw it very wise\n[2302.6s] that we he has given us food to eat.\n[2305.1s] Genesis 1:29. Is that true? Then this\n[2308.0s] one shall be your food. We know the food\n[2309.4s] that God gave us. He know very well that\n[2311.8s] after eating uh after eating and the\n[2314.6s] good food is used in the system, there\n[2316.8s] are some waste that must be removed. Is\n[2318.4s] that true? And he has given us the\n[2321.2s] medium in which the waste products are\n[2323.0s] removed from our our bodies. What are\n[2325.7s] they? First\n[2329.3s] change the mediums where waste products\n[2332.6s] are removed from our bodies. One the\n[2335.2s] skin. Uhhuh. Yes.\n[2338.6s] Kidney\n[2342.2s] the\n[2343.6s] l give us the fourth\n[2346.1s] one. No this class should be balance\n[2348.6s] when you are\n[2350.0s] teachers are just okay. Give us one. The\n[2353.8s] liver. The last\n[2356.4s] one. The the pies. Uhhuh. Which one is\n[2360.8s] the largest amongst the liver?\n[2364.9s] Should it be taken care of? Yes. Should\n[2367.4s] it be taken care of? Amen. Ah, thank\n[2370.0s] you. So God in his wisdom, he knew very\n[2372.5s] well that we are going to uh to to sweat\n[2376.9s] much of the time when we are doing our\n[2378.5s] work. So that skin must be well taken\n[2380.6s] care of. If it is not well taken care\n[2383.0s] of, you are just repeating repeating\n[2385.0s] your clothes. You've uh you've worked\n[2386.8s] with these ones today, tomorrow you\n[2388.4s] repeat them, you repeat them. That is\n[2390.4s] that is very normal with us. Huh? It is\n[2392.7s] very normal. We go to the garden. This\n[2394.3s] one is for the garden. I just keep them.\n[2396.4s] And others are also coming back to sleep\n[2398.4s] with them during the night. We are told\n[2400.3s] that those impurities they going back to\n[2402.6s] the system. They reabsorbed in the\n[2405.0s] system. And what is that is equal to the\n[2407.8s] disease which is equal to the death. We\n[2410.2s] don't want to die like that. And that\n[2411.8s] one alone is not very is not making\n[2415.0s] heavens to be happy. I'm finishing\n[2416.7s] alloy. Read with me paragraph 2 109. It\n[2420.6s] says, I have also seen children's bed.\n[2423.4s] Uhhuh. In such a condition that the fall\n[2426.1s] poisonous order constantly rise from\n[2428.2s] them was to be undurable.\n[2431.5s] Keep everything the eyes of the children\n[2433.4s] rest upon and that comes in contact with\n[2436.1s] the body night or day clean and\n[2438.5s] wholesome. M this will be one means of\n[2440.7s] educating them to choose the cleanly and\n[2443.3s] the pure. Let the sleeping room of your\n[2445.8s] children be neat. However destitute it\n[2448.1s] may be of expensive furniture. Amen. So\n[2451.3s] we are told that we need to anything\n[2453.5s] that the the children are going to lay\n[2455.3s] their eyes on is cleanliness. Nothing\n[2457.4s] less, nothing more. Uh that there are\n[2459.8s] some rooms in our homes whereby when you\n[2462.7s] get into the rooms where children are\n[2464.3s] sleeping, you'll get that bad. God says\n[2468.2s] that is it is not very healthy for the\n[2470.3s] children. I know that there are some\n[2471.5s] children who are still bedwing. Please\n[2474.2s] as a parent you are supposed to take\n[2476.2s] care of the that one. If it is washing\n[2478.6s] every day wash it but you see how these\n[2480.9s] children are helped to stop bedwetting.\n[2483.8s] Maintain a proper balance. Cleanliness\n[2486.4s] and order are Christian duties. May God\n[2490.7s] really help us. I know that uh I was\n[2495.0s] late by 15 minutes but it's okay we have\n[2497.7s] to check time but God says that we have\n[2499.9s] to maintain cleanliness for us to see\n[2502.3s] God we must be clean so that you also uh\n[2506.5s] I mean if we become medical missionaries\n[2508.8s] all of us without making barriers that\n[2510.7s] we we are evangelist these people are\n[2513.0s] medical missionaries please we might we\n[2515.4s] mingle these things so that we take the\n[2518.2s] message you cannot be an evangelist and\n[2520.6s] you are you cannot keep the cleanness.\n[2523.4s] You cannot be a medical missionary but\n[2525.5s] back at home when people are not seeing\n[2527.4s] you, you are very dirty. So the mind\n[2529.9s] must be washed, the soul must be washed\n[2532.5s] and also our physical body must be pure\n[2534.9s] so that we see God when he's coming in\n[2537.2s] his second time in Jesus name we pray.\n[2540.6s] So I think questions uh we shall tackle\n[2543.8s] them in the next lesson. Let us pray.\n[2558.9s] Lord our father in\n[2561.2s] heaven. It is true that cleanliness is a\n[2565.1s] very small topic that we might think\n[2569.3s] so but we found that it entails a\n[2572.8s] lot. We pray that you may forgive us in\n[2575.8s] whichever way we've gone against thy\n[2577.6s] will. And it is a high time that we\n[2580.6s] begin with this small things so that we\n[2582.3s] can reach greater\n[2583.7s] things. It is you who call your\n[2587.8s] disciples that they should be given the\n[2591.2s] power to defeat all the\n[2593.4s] devils. One of the devils which is\n[2595.7s] catching up with us is\n[2597.9s] uncleanliness. May you help us Lord so\n[2601.2s] that we become clean in all aspects are\n[2604.2s] waiting for your second kingdom. Thank\n[2606.9s] you for the session that is passed and\n[2609.4s] all the sessions that had passed in the\n[2611.0s] morning and even the ones which are\n[2612.8s] left. May you lead us through your holy\n[2614.7s] spirit in the name of Jesus I pray.\n[2617.1s] Amen.\n[2619.8s] Thank you."

And uh another\n[378.2s] thing you can use here is um the the the\n[383.9s] nuts the one you were speaking\n[386.7s] yesterday. You can make them in a good\n[389.5s] way. So you can apply uh in this salad.\n[393.8s] So today uh unfortunately we don't have\n[397.4s] the oils but we will use whatever we\n[399.6s] have here. So welcome to our\n[412.7s] [Music]\n[415.6s] class.\n[441.6s] Amen. Amen.\n[451.7s] [Music]\n[456.2s] Okay.\n[476.2s] So these things here we have washed them\n[479.1s] they are clean and even those who are\n[482.9s] preparing the salad they have washed\n[486.3s] their hands\n[488.5s] uh and\n[491.6s] now they're in the processing of\n[495.5s] cutting and\n[498.8s] grating. And uh\n[516.7s] I could not see\n[525.3s] her. Excuse me. Yeah, I\n[528.8s] think that you can give us you know\n[532.9s] personally I don't understand what you\n[534.7s] trying to do because I'm\n[536.3s] just creating so you can tell us the\n[539.0s] process how you started how you've been\n[541.4s] doing it and how we can follow because\n[545.2s] you\n[547.5s] can I mean\n[554.3s] and\n[555.6s] to\n[562.3s] [Music]\n[576.6s] Cabbage.

I'll try my best to use it for the interest of those who are outside and I hope all things will go well. Um my time always runs very fast. So for the interest of that allow me just to pray and we begin. Let's pray. Gracious loving father in heaven, we thank you and we praise you. Thank you for your love for the whole week to this day. We are now approaching the Sabbath and Lord, you've been so wonderful to each one of us. We are getting into another study and we ask for your blessings. Lead us through. We pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ, your son. Amen. For those who are joining this program for the first time, my name is cos gay stiffen misoy. I just want to invite you to this program. It's called self support work. And the intention of this program is to bring a balance between ministry and how to sustain ourselves while we go for ministry. That is the intention. That means God is leading us in this moments of reformation to avoid both extremes. The first extreme which all of us are accustomed to and the society is so much into it is the love of the world. That means we throw ourselves into the field of life to acquire wealth as much as we can forgetting that we need to live a divine life and to do the work of God in heralding the gospel to those who are to be saved. The second extreme is an idea of a monastic lifestyle, monish kind of life which makes people to just want to do the preaching and preaching and preaching only nothing else. So the Lord wants us to have a balance between preaching and self-sustainance for the ministry. I have levered in the previous sessions to establish that the Lord has given us very many gifts both spiritual and natural and acquired. Amen. We saw that all these talents both acquired and those that the Lord has given us are intended to serve other people. The Bible says the spirit give us the gifts severally to every man according to our ability that it may profit that we may profit with all. Right? Amen. Now you will remember that you keep answering as I ask you questions because it keeps telling me we are together. So in this third um sequel we are going to talk about the Bible and work. What does the Bible say about work or labor in another way? But just before I get into that I do not have very many slides but let me just begin with this text in the Bible in the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 8 vers 2. For those who have met me before, you know it's one of my favorite texts that I love reading before any study. The Bible says in 1 Corinthians chapter 8 and 2, \"And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.\" Amen. If any man refers to all of us, there is no one who is left out of that text. It doesn't matter whe you are a senior minister and you've been in the field for 30 years or 50 or you came to the field yesterday or this morning you gave your life to Jesus. The Bible says if any man of course definitely the word man here does not refer to those people who dress like me. It refers to all of us as humanity. Amen. I think u you understand when the old Bible says man it refers to humanity the old English rather and we are told if any man thinks that he knoweth anything he knows how much nothing so if you think you knew anything you must settle that with yourself that how much do you know the Bible says nothing as you ought to do what to know that should be the attitude with which we come to every study as brethren because the Lord will want to lead us deeper and deeper. But as soon as you say in yourself, I know that you block the way that the Lord should not lead you further and further. Amen. Now let me bring you now into this clearly. Um what does the Bible say about work? Now we know that the book of Genesis chapter 1 and chapter 2 are explanations of what the Lord did. Amen. So we will say that God is the first worker or can you find any other worker except God as the first one. The Bible says in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Amen. Was that work when the Lord created? What's the other word we can use for created? Made. The Lord made made. What's the other word? Formed. The Lord formed. So you understand that the process of creating or forming is work. Amen. Uh now I didn't want to define this but does anyone remember the definition of the word work in science? What was work? I used to say the product of what and what? What was that? Yes. Oh no no no. Okay. Because we do not remember. Let's not trouble ourselves. But there is something like that. Yes. So, okay. Right. I hope all things will go well. [Music] Um, so the Lord was working for how many days? How long did it take for the Lord to create the heavens and the earth? Six days. Amen. That very first week we will say Genesis chapter one is a wonderful story of how God spend the very first week which forms the blueprint for all the time that will exist afterward. Amen. Now you know that before Genesis 1, time had never existed. Do you know that? Maybe you didn't get that. There was no time before Genesis 1 verse one. Before the Bible says in the beginning, that's the beginning of time. From then the time began to be reckoned. But before then, we call it what? Eternity. Amen. So from that beginning going into that side we call it eternity. No counting of years. And when we shall have spent a thousand years in heaven and we come to this earth again and we begin a very long long long life into eternity. There will be no accounting of time. You've heard that song which says there is no counting of time over there. There was no counting of time. But as soon as time began to be counted, the very first part of that time the Lord spent a week to work. And when the Lord had worked for six days, he rested on the seventh. Amen. And it made a complete one week of seven days. And from that time to this date, there has just been cycles of that very very week. Amen. You know this song with the morning has broken like the first. Now each morning that we see is like the very very first morning. Each Sabbath that we see is like the very very first Sabbath. Every Sunday that we see is like the very very first Sunday. So the Lord spent a week to demonstrate to us what we will be doing from that time unto eternity. Amen. Yeah. Sure. So that's it. So I am saying the Lord has painted a clear picture for humanity for what we should be engaged in for the rest of the days. How many days should we walk? Six days. Genesis 2 8 the Bible says and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had found. Amen. Again apart from creating the Lord does what is called planting. Now you realize that planting doesn't sound so much of creation right or how many of you by planting in the gardens they are creating but we know the lord has put in principles and by his powerful word he still makes those plants to grow and that creation and regeneration is progressed. Amen. That's it. So the Lord also was the first gardener or the first farmer. And so I have said often times those who are going to get engaged in farming walk their work is the closest in similarity with what God did. Amen. Yeah. So Genesis 2:15 says, \"And the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.\" Amen. I am asking you a question in this verse 2 15. Had sin occurred in the world? No. But the Lord made man to do what? After he placed him in the garden, he said to him to do what? To dress it and to do what? And to keep it. Now you know there were no weeds to make man so disturbed. No, he wasn't worried about very many things. There was no watering. But the Lord wanted him to keep it because the Lord was a creator and he had made man in his own image. Man was supposed to reflect God even in the caring and making things to look more beautiful than they were. Amen. Right? So but after sin something else happened. That's Genesis 3:19. The Bible says to Adam. Now you know the story how it happened. how they fell into sin and how the Lord came in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid and the Lord said who told you that you are naked you know the story now Genesis 3:19 says two man to the man after the Lord had given the punishment he began with who yes he began with who there were three parties to be punished began with now there was the woman there was the serpent And then there was the man. The Lord began with who? Did he begin really with the man? You go and find that. But now, let me read it. 3:1 19. It says to Adam, \"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground, for out of it was thou taken, for dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return.\" So the Lord says to the man, you shall eat by sweat. I ask you this question. Before sin was man eating by sweat. No, that means the work that man was doing was not the labor which over taxes or which taxes our strength. It was rejuvenating. The work was like recreation. You know when you are having recreation, you're relaxing and listening to music. Do you sweat? Do you feel tired? Relax. That's what God intended. The work shall be for mana. 3:23 says, \"Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken.\" So previously the Lord had said to do what? to keep to dress and to to keep it. Amen. But in the last portion he says to do what? To till the ground from whence he was taken. So we are very sure that before sin man was not tealing the ground. He was keeping it and dressing it. Yeah. But after sin, he was supposed to till it and from then uh he will get his food through hard labor and the Lord designed it that way for the interest of lessening the effect of sin. Yeah. The Sabbath is a testimony of work. The Bible says in Exodus 20:8, remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Sixth day shalt thou labor and do all thy work. But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt not do any work, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man's servant, nor thy maid servant, nor thy kettle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day. Wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it. Amen. Now you we've read this text over and over laying emphasis on the importance of remembering the Sabbath and keeping it holy. Amen. Now today we are reading this text to lay emphasis on walking on six days. Now the Bible says how many days shall you work? Six days. Now I want to imagine that you are not going to work for six days. Do you have any reason why you should rest on the Sabbath? So anyone who has not been working for the six days does not have any warrant to rest on the on the Sabbath because otherwise he has been resting. But the Bible doesn't say six days shall thou rest. Does the Bible say that? So but human beings we love resting more than doing what? than working except children. Children are the only prime example of what the Lord designed. I'm talking about young children. Those who have not known what relaxing means. They do not love to sleep. They will only sleep as they are overcome by sleep, not by their own design. But we who have grown up, we know that living a leisure kind of a life is the ideal for us. Our education system has taught us that way that we need to be resting and you just need to work hard a little bit enjoy a vast life of idleness. The Bible doesn't teach that. The Bible teaches that work for how many days or six days. And in the Bible there is nothing like a vacation where you have a vacation to rest. No, it's about working for how many days? He who breaks the Sabbath on the seventh day is guilty of breaking the law of the Lord. And he who is idol on six six days is also guilty of breaking the very very law. Said that's that's too much on our side. But we need to think about that. Let's read further thoughts from the Bible concerning work. Proverbs 13:1 says, \"Wealth goten by vanity shall be diminished, but he that gatherth by labor shall increase.\" Amen. Wealth gotten by vanity, vanity. You know, there are many ways that the world is teaching us that you can acquire money or wealth. And one example is gambling. You place 100 shillings and you earn how much? A million. And many people want to do that, right? Because we love wealth gotten by vanity. The Bible says if you get wealth by vanity, what happens? It shall diminish. What does it mean to diminish? Now people who have studed business the one which is gotten by labor does what? It increases. Amen. Do you see that there is the blessing of the Lord in labor and not in idleness? The Lord recognizes only one moment in a week where you need to rest and that is the Sabbath. You work for six days and then you rest on Sabbath and that's what the Lord wants and you will have your wealth increase. You rest on the six days and your wealth will diminish. That's it. I didn't say that. It's the Bible. Proverbs 21:25 the Bible says the desire of the slothful killth him for his ants refuse to labor. The desire of the slothful. Now we said the other day a slothful person is a lazy [Music] person. So they keeping because you do not have. So when you pass, you say, \"Wow, what a nice vehicle. I wish I had that man. It will kill you. If your hands will accept to work, you will have it.\" Amen. I'll get that quote someday um before we finish this. It's on councils on stewardship that the Lord has placed in the heart of man the desire to accumulate wealth and it's godly. I'm not talking about those who love the world. Talking about people like Abraham who will not make their wealth the object of their life. We talking about such people. That desire is divine to bring wealth together. And wealth means what? It means what you have, right? If it's clothes, if it is food, is that wealth? Yeah. 21 26 it says he coveted greedily all the day long but the righteous giveth and spareth not. Amen. So the slothful person covert greedily now greedily means what? Soed greedy all the day long. So what's the work of a slothful person? a lazy person just sit down and imagine things and keeps imagining like one time you know these were the thoughts I used to have when I used to go to school you know because I was very ambitious and I knew one time I'll have a very beautiful big house very nice car living in a very nice estate with very beautiful children and beautiful wife attending in a beautiful church those were always the ideas you get the point that's covetousness And that's laziness because it is the truth that there is nothing good that comes on a silver platter. Amen. Yeah. That's a statement which must can pass to be scriptures. That's how it is. That's what the Bible says here. If you are a lazy person, you keep desiring. You keep coveting. And the Bible doesn't want you to coveret. But if you are laboring, you minimize the moments of covetousness. Proverbs 14:23 says, \"In all labor there is what? Profit.\" In all labor there is what? Profit. But the talk of the lips tended to what? Pen. So the Bible calls us to labor and if you labor there is profit. Amen. No one should entertain the idea of idleness whatsoever. There are friends here and you are hearing messages on true education and you do not love going to school because you do not love reading and you don't love the school program and then you think because you heard this message now it's high good time I got an opportunity to quit. You get the point? So the reason for you to choose true education is because you found it an easy way to avoid work, right? The Lord judgeth the hearts. You see it so deep into your heart. And if you want to make a decision based on this friend, you are just an infidel. I will say to you personally and advise you go back to school and study. Did you get the point? If you are making that decision out of an avoidance of work, go back. You are not sincere in your heart. You are living a lie. Abraham was not leaving his place because he was avoiding work. You get the point. I hope that one no one will follow me late and say you are denying the truth. I am telling you a message that the Lord wants us to have in this time because God wants us to be sincere in our hearts. Not because we found it easy to follow this direction is why we left the other direction if that is the reason the lord will judge the heart I don't say further on that so we are told the words of the lip they tend to penary into poverty and poverty enough I'll still talk about idleness uh when we'll talk about self-sport proper that it is required of every steward to be faithful in the place where he is. Amen. So if the Lord shall call you to be a mother, you be faithful in your duties as a mother without idleness or laziness. 2 Thessalonians 3:10 the Bible says, \"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any will not work, neither shall he do what should he should he eat. For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, walking not at all, but are busy bodies. Now them that are such we command and exalt by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they walk and eat their own bread. Amen. The Lord is calling us and because this meeting is meant for the youth primarily our generation is cast. We are living at a gener generation of idleness where people will not want to work. People want to live. I'm not talking about the church only. The rest of the world people just want to live a careless easy lifestyle. Is that a true or false? We try to avoid work as much as possible. Paul says when they were at Thessalonica, what did they do? They commanded them that those who do not work should not do what? Should not eat. And he says, \"For we hear that there are some among you who are busy bodies.\" You know what busy bodies are? You is about people who meddle with other people's businesses. Someone is busy doing their stuff, you are there busy speaking about very many many things. The Bible is saying to us that this life of busy boding and especially speaks categorically on women. When you go to Timothy now he says this is the best counel for us if you are found in such a category he says we command and exalt you by the lord do what in quietness go and walk and eat your own bread. Amen. The church should not encourage laziness at all costs. If someone is blessed with strength, let them walk and eat their own bread. Amen. You know, we will still talk about these things in depth for sure. But that's the word of the Bible. Amen. He said this time always passes quickly, but today I'll catch up with it. Let's uh we have a very wonderful reading here on CT 277. We begin with paragraph 1. I'll do some few readings and then I'll just end. The things of earth are more closely connected with heaven and are more directly under the supervision of Christ than many realize. The things of the earth, we are told are connected with the things of where heaven. Now you know Christ is that ladder which connects heaven and earth. And we are told that Christ is directly supervising these things than we can ever realize. He says all right inventions and improvements have their source in him who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working. Amen. All right. Inventions and improvements. the person who invented this light and it's the right one. The Bible says it does it so well. The other day just to remind you perhaps we we can forget we were created by the Lord. Amen. Unless you guys believe in evolution. If you believe in evolution then you are exempted from thinking in this manner. You can think the other way around. But this is the thought. If you are created by the Lord, you received your life from who? From the Lord. And every ability and every gift that you have comes from who? From the Lord. Sometimes we say it's natural as though it invented itself across the way. Evolution is the only way one which says uh species keep acquiring uh advantages over other species. But the Lord equipped us with strength uh and efficiency and intellect and all these gifts which we can use. So if you can invent something the ability the intelligence you are using came from who? From the lord. We said every good gift comes from where? From above from the lord of lights. So we are told that every invention and every improvement have the associ him who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in workings the skillful touch of the physician's hand. So the doctor when he treats with that skillful hand we are told his power and nerve and muscle is knowledge of the delicate mechanism of the body is the wisdom of divine power. Amen. So if you have a thorough knowledge on anatomy and physiology and how all these things work, it comes from where? From the Lord to be used in behalf of the suffering. So the Lord has equipped you to profit with all. Amen. The skill with which the carpenter uses his tools, the strength with which the blacksmith makes the anvil ring come from God. Amen. You know, I'm reading these things and uh my heart really melts because when this message began, we didn't see these things so clearly as they appear right now. Amen. The Lord is opening the path of light. Doesn't the Bible says the path of a righteous man shineth further and farther unto the perfect day? Amen. That's it. So the Lord is saying if you are a carpenter the skill that you have comes from who? From the Lord. If you are a blacksmith. That strength comes from who? From the Lord. Whatever we do, wherever we are placed, he desires to control our minds that we may do perfect work. Amen. So wherever the Lord will place you, whatever you will do, the Lord desires to control our minds. Amen. Paragraph 2277 says, \"Christianity and business rightly understood are not two separate things. They are harmony.\" You are not with me friends. Inana Christianity and business rightly understood are not two separate things. They are many. So Christianity and business are many. They are one. If you rightly understand them. If you think they are two, it's because we have not understood them. You get the point. Bible religion is to be brought into all that we do and say. Human and divine agencies are to combine in temporal as well as spiritual achievements. So while we cooperate with God on spiritual matters which we do when we pray, when we preach, when we study, when we do all these things, we cooperate with God. And so we must cooperate with him also on the temporal when we go and farm and we are digging and we are planting seed and we are pushing the nails into the wood. The Lord wants us to cooperate with him. They are to be united in all human pursuits in mechanical and in agricultural labors in meantile and scientific enterprises. Amen. Higher than the highest human thought is God's ideal for his children. That's a very famous quote on education. The Lord is not bringing us a true education which is totally inferior to the world. The Lord wants us that on mechanics and on science and on merchandise that mercantile means merchandise, right? Business. The Lord wants us to be the best of the best. I believe this personally that the Lord is not calling us to a true education which is inferior to that one which the devil has given to the world. What's the biggest problem with false education? It blends the truth with what? With error so that you cannot differentiate what is true and what is false. And that's where a true education comes and makes a correction. It is of a truth that in false education there are still elements of truth. Is that the truth or false? Yeah, there are still elements of truth. And that is why we can still even find things which were useful and they can still be used in the service of who? Because the devil managed to mingle what? Truth and what? And error. And for sure while we also drunk the error, we also got some element of what? of truth. So we are not like totally saying it is totally unfit. There are aspects of it which were in reality good. Is that the truth? But why should we go and partake the whole thing when the Lord is providing an option for that which is better without leaving that which was good over the other side. Over the other side. Amen. We have taken too long to implement true education in its practical aspect and that's why when we read such statements they do not appear in their true light but the Lord is calling out a people who will make a straight stamina not only in word of speaking about false education but in real practice of what it means to practice true education and it shall be proven I am pastor persed that before this arts history is closed, the Lord will allow us to make a clear demonstration of that practical true education which he brought to his people. It's been my prayer and I hope one time we shall show it so that people will not ask where shall we go from here. The Lord will say that's the place but we need to move so hastily so that when we shall say about mechanics and agriculture and science and business it will be practically in aspect that truly the lord has given us that field let's read further 21 paragraph 3 says there is a remedy for indolence what's indolence laziness and we have said this generation is characterized by laziness. We want to pick things which are easier to do than those ones which are hard to do. There is a remedy we are told and that is to throw off sluggishness as sin. Sluggish. Slugish. Like you want to do something but you are what? You are sluggish. This is the antidote for indolence. Throw off all sluggishness as sin that leads to pition. Just know that if I am sluggish, I will be destroyed because pition means to perish and go to work. So you throw sluggishness and you go to do what? To work. Using with determination and vigor the physical ability that God has given. So if the Lord has given you physical ability, use that to your determination. The only cure for a useless, inefficient life is determined, persevering effort. So if you've been idle, the only way to remedy that is to have a determined persevering effort. Life is not given us to be spent in idleness or self-pleasing. You might not be idol, but you might be choosing things which are pleasing to you. Right? The Lord doesn't want us to do that. Before us are placed great possibilities in the capital of strength. A precious talent has been entrusted to men for labor. So the Lord has committed you has entrusted you a precious talent. This is of more value than any bank deposit and should be more highly priced for through the possibilities that it affords for enabling men to lead a useful happy life it may be made to yield interest. says the strength that the Lord has given you is more valuable than the money you have deposited in the bank. You've heard this. I I I saw it somewhere. Someone was asking if you are asked to choose between brain now because it was said brain but let me just say knowledge and money. Which one will you choose? And definitely we will choose money, right? What about strength and money? What will we choose? Money. Because the dominance of our generation has taught us that money is the main thing. It's not friends. We need to think again. The Lord wants us to be useful in our lives. It's not just about money. Even the ecclesiast writer said the rest is not always to the fastest nor battle to the strong. Then he says time and chance for everyone. Sometimes we are engaging in business and we are not very successful for sure because the rest is not to the past. So that does not mean because we are not succeeding we should always think about money only because on all these things the Lord wants to make our character. You see the main thing to be gained is heaven. While on the long run we can sustain ourselves on the businesses that we earn. The main aim is to gain heaven. So that strength is of more value. You can lead a more useful life, balanced life than when you have money. No man has a right to sacrifice this talent to the corroding influence of inaction. All are as accountable for the capital of physical strength as for their capital of means. Now we said the other day there are several talents. We mentioned money. You remember that? We mentioned strength too. You remember that? So if the Lord commits to you strength and not money, he will require from you the use of strength. Now if you are idol, how many of us for sure have been blessed with strength, but we live a very idol, useless life. How many? Very many of us with a thought that I am still in school. You see, I'm studying. I'm going to work later. The Lord wants us to use this strength. Our schools of today have become so perverted that we think the brain is the main thing and not the brain actually it is the paper it is the certificate because if it was the brain there will be very many people even sneaking into universities to acquire an education so that they can use it in practical lifestyle without a certificate. But are there such cases where people sneak into the university because it will be useless if you don't have a paper? No one will recognize you. You get the point. So that the importance of the education of today is only found where? In the paper. Not in the person himself. But education should be found in your brother. If it is separate from you, it's useless. That's why he says hold on after education. Hold on it. Don't let it go. That's what the Bible says. But if it's packaged in a paper, that's as useless as any other paper. Because without the paper, you cannot prove that you are educated. You will need a certificate to come before the Lord to say, I'm going to bring my degree. The Lord does not need that. The Lord needs to equip us with education itself. And that education should be in us to be able to solve all practical life problems. That's it. I'm going forward. I just want to I think I still have maybe two 10 minutes. I have maybe two or three slides and I'm done. Judicious labor is healthful tonic for the human race. Judicious means temporate. you are not overwork because you were say we said we should avoid both extremes where the endeavor becomes just working for money. So we should judicious labor is a helpful tonic for the human race. Amen. It makes the feeble strong, the poor rich, the wretched happy. Amen. Satan lies in ambush, ready to destroy those whose leisure gives him opportunity to approach them under some attractive disguise. He is never more successful than when he comes to men in their idol hours. Satan lies in ambush and he is waiting to get you when you are not aware and he says he is always very successful when we are idle but when we are busy even the statement goes an idol mind is the devil's workshop and I think Luther said on the fundamentals of education he says the devil will find a work for idol hands so if you are hands are idol the devil will find a work for for you. The essential lesson of contented industry is in the necessary duties of life is yet to be learned by many of Christ followers. Let's redo that statement again. The essential lesson of contented industry in the necessary duties of life is yet to be learned by many of Christ followers. That statement places the learning in future knowing already that we have not learned this essential knowledge of contented industry. You've heard very many parents say that and they keep saying because we really think that our blessings from the Lord depend on university papers. Many people think that way, right? That without that paper, the Lord is not going to do what? To bless you. Go out and work. Be a useful person. Don't love idleness. But many people want to study to minimize their work in future. Not work. Are people going to study to work? The problem is if you work hard right now, you will be relaxing in future. Right? And many people are working hard in class to earn idleness in future. We are yet to learn as a people this essential lesson. It requires more grace, more than discipline of character to work for God in the capacity of mechanic, merchant, lawyer or farmer carrying the precepts of Christianity into the ordinary business of life than to labor as an acknowledged missionary in the open field. You got the statement. Was that right? Most of us desire to be missionaries, acknowledged missionaries in the open field. See, that's what we desire. But we are told which one requires more discipline of character. Is it working as a missionary in the open field? You know, when I'm a missionary and I'm walking around, everyone knows cuz gay is a missionary. Hey, hello pastor. Hello missionary. Hello to mission. I try to order my life because I keep meeting people that I speak about the gospel every now and then. That's my chief work, you see. So I rise up, I put on my suit, I put on my tie, I take my Bible, I walk visiting people and saying hello, Jesus loves you. Jesus loves you. What about a mechanic who has to deal with very many types of people and he must be an honest man and must witness for Christ still. The Bible is calling us to this persuasion that we should understand that wherever the place the Lord will place you, he requires you to work for him as a missionary. Amen. It is true that others will be called to be missionaries in the field that will be their chief work like Peter and John who said friends should we stop preaching the word and come and serve the tables why don't you look for people who can serve what the tables and when they went to look for people who can serve the the the tables sorry anyway for sure in our place those words look the same D and T and B and V and P they are the same. So whichever comes in my mouth just know what I'm trying to say. So say should we look for those who are going to serve the tables but those who are going to serve the tables the qualifications was that they must also be spirit filled. Amen. And so if you're going to work as a mechanic the lord requires that you also must be a spiritfilled person to work for him. Amen. It requires a strong spiritual nerve to bring religion into the workshop and the business office sanctifying the details of everyday life and ordering every transaction according to the standard of God's word. But this is what the Lord requires. Amen. And we said people are given many talents. The Lord will require of you. The Lord will require from you. There will be no excuse. So if you are a preacher and the Lord has given you also the gift of business, do business as you do what? As you preach. Because the Lord, if you will do business and you stop preaching, the Lord will require from you the talent of preaching. And if you will preach and you leave business out, the Lord will require from you the talent of what? Of business. Did you get the point? But others will be given one. Say for example, a brother has been given the talent of preaching. And it's only one talent. All of us expect him to be preaching. Amen. That's the only thing that the Lord will require from him. You understand that the Lord will require from us the highest of what we have heard. We must come to this conviction and personally I'm persuaded if we must preach the loud cry then all the talents must be brought into the work. Every part of our lives must be touched because God will send business people to that direction to that direction because how will I preach to the Muslims? Will I set up a crusade? Will they listen? But by my dealings, let me tell you one time when I completed my form four and I was doing a business and God gave me a privilege um to meet with a Muslim for sure. I'll go to him. I was buying stuff. I was doing food business. So I will be buying stuff. He was a wholesaler. So I'll go and buy. So we became good friends. So I'll come and say hey hello my I don't even remember his name. Uh but he was a good brother. Now one time he gave me a book. He said to me, I have a book for you here. I see that your heart is a very good. I will give you this book. It was a Muslim book. Now I had been praying that God will give me an opportunity to speak to this brother about the gospel. I thank that he already observed early that I was a good man. You get the point. You know that's preaching already and he will give me this book. While I was still standing in the very very shop, I was holding the book. The time is over. All right, I'll end it. I'm finishing the story and I end it. I was still standing on the counter and another pastor uh he was coming from a Sunday church and the pastor just came in. They were also friends. And then when he saw me with a book, he said, \"Oh, what's that book?\" He took it and when he just began holding it, the brother, the Muslim brother just came and took the book by force and he said this book I gave it to him. It should not just be held by any other person. I understood at that moment how much honor he gave to their book. It was not a Quran. It was just an adapted book giving some statements from the Quran. uh but in that contact if you are going to do business if we spend actually he left so we didn't have very much time together afterwards we God will have brought me into contact to the point that I could minister to him because definitely once he has observed that I am a good person definitely he will also want to know deeper if I said anything to him he will easily accept he actually taught me how to make rice Yeah. And actually I tried and it worked very well. So I agree that in business we can really reach people and if the Lord has given me that I really preach from the pullpit for sure. I go for public campaigns too. I also do little medical missionary and I do media ministry. That's what I do personally. I also do a lot of other work on because God really endored me in very many other things. And I appreciate that the Lord is calling for all these talents to finish the work. Don't hide the talent thinking that you must only work in a single place because the Lord will require the rest of the talents from you. I believe this is the balance that God is calling us to. The ministry will not suffer if we brought the talents will it? I mean the work of the Lord will not work will not go forward because our talents to work for the Lord. Yeah. Let's pray. Precious loving God in heaven, we thank you and we praise you. You are speaking to our dear hearts that we should give unto God what belongs to God and unto Caesar, what belongs to Caesar. We have very many talents which we've hidden for a long time and some are very practical and sometimes because of thinking they are very secular. We have robbed you of these talents. But Lord, you are calling us as a people in these moments of the loud cry to bring every gift to your service. Now we have very young people here with very uh huge strengths. We pray Lord may they be willing to surrender these strengths to you that you may use them to further their cause. Lord we pray give us comfort and encouragement. There are many things Lord that we have sacrificed for the interest of the gospel and Lord your promise is in this life we shall get 100fold and even in the life to come. Help to suffer loss to you we will say if it were not for the gospel we will be better. But Lord, help us to know that we will say if it were not for the gospel, we will be worse. I pray for our church. Help us to awaken to this realization, to say these opportunities, and to further your cause and to finish the work. Thank you for hearing our prayers. We pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ, your son. Amen. Amen. Thank you. God bless you.",
        "timestamped_transcript": "[3.8s] This is not\n[5.3s] working.\n[6.9s] So if it's not working, I may take the\n[11.7s] advantage. All\n[13.6s] right. Happy\n[16.5s] Friday. Yeah, as I\n[18.8s] said, it's not my\n[22.8s] preference. Okay, thank you. I'll try my\n[25.9s] best to use it for the interest of those\n[29.0s] who are outside and I hope all things\n[31.8s] will go well. Um my time always runs\n[35.9s] very fast. So for the interest of that\n[38.9s] allow me just to pray and we begin.\n[41.0s] Let's\n[47.2s] pray. Gracious loving father in heaven,\n[50.2s] we thank you and we praise you. Thank\n[53.0s] you for your love for the whole week to\n[55.4s] this day. We are now approaching the\n[57.7s] Sabbath and Lord, you've been so\n[59.8s] wonderful to each one of us. We are\n[62.3s] getting into another study and we ask\n[64.3s] for your blessings. Lead us through. We\n[66.6s] pray in the precious name of Jesus\n[68.2s] Christ, your son. Amen.\n[74.9s] For those who are joining this program\n[77.0s] for the first time, my name is cos gay\n[80.8s] stiffen\n[83.2s] misoy. I just want to invite you to this\n[86.3s] program. It's called self support work.\n[91.3s] And the intention of this program is to\n[94.5s] bring a balance\n[96.4s] between\n[98.4s] ministry and how to sustain ourselves\n[102.5s] while we go for ministry. That is the\n[105.8s] intention. That means God is leading us\n[109.3s] in this moments of reformation to avoid\n[113.1s] both extremes.\n[115.2s] The first extreme which all of us are\n[117.4s] accustomed to and the society is so much\n[120.2s] into it is the love of the world. That\n[123.6s] means we throw ourselves into the field\n[127.0s] of life to acquire wealth as much as we\n[130.6s] can forgetting that we need to live a\n[134.1s] divine life and to do the work of God in\n[137.7s] heralding the gospel to those who are to\n[140.7s] be saved. The second\n[144.0s] extreme is an idea of a monastic\n[147.4s] lifestyle, monish kind of life which\n[151.5s] makes people to just want to do the\n[154.6s] preaching and preaching and preaching\n[157.0s] only nothing else. So the Lord wants us\n[160.8s] to have a balance between\n[163.8s] preaching and self-sustainance for the\n[168.8s] ministry. I have levered in the\n[171.9s] previous sessions to establish that the\n[174.7s] Lord has given us very many gifts both\n[178.2s] spiritual and natural and acquired.\n[182.1s] Amen. We saw that all these talents both\n[185.9s] acquired and those that the Lord has\n[188.2s] given us are\n[190.4s] intended to serve other people. The\n[193.9s] Bible says the spirit give us the gifts\n[198.2s] severally to every man according to our\n[200.2s] ability that it may profit that we may\n[202.6s] profit with all. Right?\n[205.8s] Amen. Now you will remember that you\n[208.6s] keep answering as I ask you questions\n[212.0s] because it keeps telling me we are\n[214.5s] together.\n[215.8s] So in this third um sequel we are going\n[220.0s] to talk about the Bible and work. What\n[223.7s] does the Bible say about\n[227.1s] work or labor in another way? But just\n[231.0s] before I get into that I do not have\n[233.6s] very many\n[234.9s] slides but let me just begin with this\n[238.0s] text in the Bible in the book of 1\n[240.2s] Corinthians chapter 8 vers 2. For those\n[244.2s] who have met me before, you know it's\n[246.3s] one of my favorite texts that I love\n[249.2s] reading before any study. The Bible says\n[253.0s] in 1 Corinthians chapter 8 and 2, \"And\n[256.8s] if any man think that he knoweth\n[259.1s] anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he\n[263.1s] ought to know.\"\n[265.5s] Amen. If any man refers to all of us,\n[268.8s] there is no one who is left out of that\n[271.1s] text. It doesn't matter whe you are a\n[273.8s] senior minister and you've been in the\n[275.7s] field for 30 years or 50 or you came to\n[280.1s] the field yesterday or this morning you\n[283.2s] gave your life to Jesus. The Bible says\n[286.2s] if any man of course definitely the word\n[288.9s] man here does not refer to those people\n[292.1s] who dress like me. It refers to all of\n[295.6s] us as humanity. Amen. I think u you\n[299.8s] understand when the old Bible says man\n[303.0s] it refers to humanity the old English\n[305.6s] rather and we are told if any man thinks\n[309.5s] that he knoweth anything he knows how\n[311.9s] much nothing so if you think you knew\n[314.7s] anything you must settle that with\n[316.8s] yourself that how much do you know the\n[318.9s] Bible says nothing as you ought to do\n[322.1s] what to know that should be the attitude\n[325.8s] with which we come to every study as\n[328.8s] brethren because the Lord will want to\n[331.4s] lead us deeper and deeper. But as soon\n[334.3s] as you say in yourself, I know that you\n[339.2s] block the way that the Lord should not\n[341.2s] lead you further and further. Amen. Now\n[345.8s] let me bring you now into this clearly.\n[349.4s] Um what does the Bible say about work?\n[354.1s] Now we know that the book of Genesis\n[356.7s] chapter 1 and chapter 2 are\n[360.8s] explanations of what the Lord did.\n[364.6s] Amen. So we will say that God is the\n[368.6s] first worker or can you find any other\n[373.2s] worker except God as the first one. The\n[376.9s] Bible says in the beginning God created\n[380.1s] the heaven and the earth. Amen. Was that\n[385.2s] work when the Lord\n[387.8s] created? What's the other word we can\n[389.9s] use for\n[391.9s] created? Made. The Lord made made.\n[395.9s] What's the other\n[397.6s] word? Formed. The Lord formed. So you\n[401.7s] understand that the process of creating\n[404.0s] or\n[405.3s] forming is work. Amen.\n[409.8s] Uh now I didn't want to define this but\n[413.5s] does anyone remember the definition of\n[415.5s] the word work in\n[417.1s] science? What was\n[419.6s] work? I used to say the product of what\n[422.0s] and what? What was\n[425.0s] that?\n[427.6s] Yes. Oh no no no. Okay. Because we do\n[430.7s] not remember. Let's not trouble\n[432.1s] ourselves. But there is something like\n[433.8s] that. Yes.\n[438.9s] So, okay. Right. I hope all things will\n[442.8s] go well.\n[444.4s] [Music]\n[450.4s] Um, so the\n[453.4s] Lord was working for how many\n[457.8s] days? How long did it take for the Lord\n[460.2s] to create the heavens and the\n[461.9s] earth? Six days.\n[465.6s] Amen. That very first week we will\n[469.9s] say Genesis chapter one is a wonderful\n[474.3s] story of how God spend the very first\n[477.3s] week which forms the blueprint for all\n[480.6s] the time that will exist afterward.\n[484.4s] Amen. Now you know that before Genesis\n[489.0s] 1, time had never existed. Do you know\n[493.6s] that? Maybe you didn't get\n[496.0s] that. There was no time before Genesis 1\n[501.8s] verse one. Before the Bible says in the\n[505.2s] beginning, that's the beginning of time.\n[508.2s] From then the time began to be reckoned.\n[511.4s] But before then, we call it\n[514.7s] what? Eternity. Amen.\n[517.8s] So from that beginning going\n[522.3s] into that side we call it eternity. No\n[525.6s] counting of years. And when we shall\n[529.0s] have spent a thousand years in\n[531.2s] heaven and we come to this earth again\n[535.1s] and we begin a very long long long life\n[538.5s] into\n[540.3s] eternity. There will be no accounting of\n[542.6s] time. You've heard that song which\n[544.8s] says there is no counting of time over\n[548.8s] there. There was no counting of time.\n[551.9s] But as soon as time began to be counted,\n[554.9s] the very first part of that time the\n[557.9s] Lord spent a\n[561.9s] week to work. And when the Lord had\n[564.9s] worked for six days, he rested on the\n[567.9s] seventh. Amen.\n[569.8s] And it made a complete one week of seven\n[572.5s] days. And from that time to this date,\n[576.6s] there has just been cycles of that very\n[580.0s] very week. Amen. You know this song with\n[583.0s] the morning has\n[593.6s] broken like the first.\n[597.6s] Now each morning that we see is like the\n[600.6s] very very first\n[603.2s] morning. Each Sabbath that we see is\n[605.9s] like the very very first Sabbath. Every\n[609.2s] Sunday that we see is like the very very\n[611.5s] first Sunday. So the Lord spent a week\n[614.2s] to demonstrate to us what we will be\n[617.0s] doing from that time unto eternity.\n[621.4s] Amen. Yeah. Sure. So that's it. So I am\n[624.7s] saying the Lord has painted a clear\n[627.3s] picture for humanity for what we should\n[630.2s] be engaged in for the rest of the days.\n[633.4s] How many days should we walk? Six days.\n[637.3s] Genesis 2 8 the Bible says and the Lord\n[641.4s] God planted a garden eastward in Eden\n[645.7s] and there he put the man whom he had\n[648.6s] found. Amen. Again apart from creating\n[652.7s] the Lord does what is called planting.\n[655.3s] Now you realize that planting doesn't\n[658.2s] sound so much of creation\n[660.7s] right or how many of you by planting in\n[663.7s] the gardens they are creating but we\n[666.5s] know the lord has put in principles and\n[668.7s] by his powerful word he still makes\n[671.5s] those plants to grow and that creation\n[674.6s] and regeneration is progressed. Amen.\n[678.2s] That's it. So the Lord also was the\n[680.5s] first gardener or the first farmer. And\n[684.0s] so I have said often times those who are\n[687.5s] going to get engaged in\n[689.6s] farming walk their work is the closest\n[693.8s] in similarity with what God did. Amen.\n[698.7s] Yeah. So Genesis 2:15 says, \"And the\n[701.7s] Lord God took the man and put him into\n[704.3s] the garden of Eden to dress it and to\n[707.0s] keep it.\" Amen.\n[708.8s] I am asking you a question in this verse\n[711.4s] 2 15. Had sin occurred in the\n[717.0s] world? No. But the Lord made man to do\n[720.2s] what? After he placed him in the garden,\n[723.0s] he said to him to do what? To dress it\n[725.5s] and to do what? And to keep it. Now you\n[728.3s] know there were no weeds to make man so\n[731.1s] disturbed. No, he wasn't worried about\n[733.5s] very many things. There was no watering.\n[735.9s] But the Lord wanted him to keep it\n[738.4s] because the Lord was a creator and he\n[740.6s] had made man in his own image. Man was\n[743.4s] supposed to reflect God even in the\n[745.8s] caring and making things to look more\n[748.0s] beautiful than they were. Amen. Right?\n[752.4s] So but after sin something else\n[755.4s] happened. That's Genesis 3:19. The Bible\n[757.8s] says to Adam. Now you know the story how\n[760.7s] it happened. how they fell into sin and\n[763.0s] how the Lord came in the cool of the day\n[765.8s] and Adam and his wife hid and the Lord\n[768.5s] said who told you that you are naked you\n[771.5s] know the story now Genesis 3:19 says two\n[774.8s] man to the man after the Lord had given\n[777.2s] the punishment he began with\n[780.5s] who yes he began with\n[783.4s] who there were three parties to be\n[785.6s] punished began\n[787.6s] with now there was the woman there was\n[790.0s] the serpent And then there\n[792.1s] was the man. The Lord began with\n[795.6s] who? Did he begin really with the man?\n[799.0s] You go and find that. But now, let me\n[801.6s] read it. 3:1 19. It says to Adam, \"In\n[805.5s] the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat\n[807.8s] bread, till thou return unto the ground,\n[810.6s] for out of it was thou taken, for dust\n[813.3s] thou art, and unto dust shall thou\n[816.4s] return.\" So the Lord says to the man,\n[819.2s] you shall eat by sweat. I ask you this\n[821.6s] question. Before sin was man eating by\n[825.2s] sweat. No, that means the work that man\n[828.0s] was doing was not the labor which over\n[832.6s] taxes or which taxes our strength. It\n[835.6s] was\n[836.4s] rejuvenating. The work was like\n[838.6s] recreation. You know when you are having\n[840.6s] recreation, you're relaxing and\n[842.9s] listening to music. Do you sweat? Do you\n[847.0s] feel\n[855.6s] tired?\n[857.6s] Relax. That's what God intended. The\n[861.3s] work shall be for mana. 3:23 says,\n[864.3s] \"Therefore the Lord God sent him forth\n[866.5s] from the garden of Eden to till the\n[869.4s] ground from whence he was taken.\" So\n[871.8s] previously the Lord had said to do what?\n[875.4s] to keep to dress and to to keep it.\n[879.2s] Amen. But in the last portion he says to\n[882.6s] do what? To till the ground from whence\n[885.8s] he was taken. So we are very sure that\n[889.0s] before sin man was not tealing the\n[891.2s] ground. He was keeping it and dressing\n[894.8s] it. Yeah. But after sin, he was supposed\n[898.0s] to till it and from then uh he will get\n[901.4s] his food through hard labor and the Lord\n[905.7s] designed it that way for the interest of\n[907.9s] lessening the effect of\n[910.6s] sin.\n[913.3s] Yeah. The Sabbath is a\n[916.2s] testimony of work.\n[919.1s] The Bible says in Exodus 20:8, remember\n[922.3s] the Sabbath day to keep it\n[925.3s] holy. Sixth day shalt thou labor and do\n[930.0s] all thy work. But the seventh day is the\n[933.8s] Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou\n[936.9s] shalt not do any work, thou nor thy son,\n[941.0s] nor thy daughter, thy man's servant, nor\n[944.2s] thy maid servant, nor thy kettle, nor\n[947.0s] thy stranger that is within thy gates.\n[949.8s] For in six days the Lord made heaven and\n[953.3s] earth, the sea and all that in them is,\n[956.8s] and rested the seventh day. Wherefore\n[959.1s] the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and\n[962.1s] hallowed it. Amen.\n[964.4s] Now you we've read this text over and\n[967.4s] over\n[969.2s] laying emphasis on the importance of\n[971.5s] remembering the Sabbath and keeping it\n[974.0s] holy.\n[975.2s] Amen. Now today we are reading this text\n[978.5s] to lay emphasis on walking on six days.\n[982.7s] Now the Bible says how many days shall\n[985.0s] you work? Six days. Now I want to\n[987.9s] imagine that you are not going to work\n[992.0s] for six days. Do you have any reason why\n[994.7s] you should rest on the\n[996.7s] Sabbath? So anyone who has not been\n[999.8s] working for the six days does not have\n[1002.7s] any warrant to rest on the on the\n[1005.6s] Sabbath because otherwise he has been\n[1008.4s] resting. But the Bible doesn't say six\n[1011.4s] days shall thou\n[1013.9s] rest. Does the Bible say\n[1016.4s] that? So but human beings we love\n[1019.8s] resting more than doing what? than\n[1022.2s] working except children. Children are\n[1024.3s] the only prime example of what the Lord\n[1027.1s] designed. I'm talking about young\n[1028.7s] children. Those who have not known what\n[1031.4s] relaxing means. They do not love to\n[1033.6s] sleep. They will only sleep as they are\n[1036.1s] overcome by sleep, not by their own\n[1038.2s] design. But we who have grown up, we\n[1040.5s] know that living a leisure kind of a\n[1043.8s] life is the ideal for us. Our education\n[1046.8s] system has taught us that way that we\n[1049.3s] need to be resting and you just need to\n[1051.7s] work hard a little bit\n[1054.0s] enjoy a vast life of idleness. The Bible\n[1057.9s] doesn't teach that. The Bible teaches\n[1059.4s] that work for how many days or six days.\n[1063.5s] And in the Bible there is nothing like a\n[1065.6s] vacation where you have a vacation to\n[1068.6s] rest. No, it's about working for how\n[1071.7s] many days? He who breaks the Sabbath on\n[1075.6s] the seventh day is guilty of breaking\n[1078.4s] the law of the Lord. And he who is idol\n[1081.3s] on six six days is also guilty of\n[1084.6s] breaking the very very law. Said that's\n[1087.4s] that's too much on our side. But we need\n[1089.9s] to think about\n[1091.3s] that. Let's read further thoughts from\n[1093.9s] the Bible concerning work. Proverbs 13:1\n[1097.2s] says, \"Wealth goten by vanity shall be\n[1101.8s] diminished, but he that gatherth by\n[1104.2s] labor shall increase.\"\n[1107.1s] Amen. Wealth gotten by vanity,\n[1113.2s] vanity. You know, there are many ways\n[1115.5s] that the world is teaching us that you\n[1117.2s] can acquire money or wealth.\n[1126.0s] And one example is\n[1128.4s] gambling. You place 100 shillings and\n[1131.6s] you earn how much? A million. And many\n[1135.7s] people want to do that, right? Because\n[1138.6s] we love wealth gotten by vanity. The\n[1142.1s] Bible says if you get wealth by\n[1144.9s] vanity, what happens? It shall diminish.\n[1148.9s] What does it mean to diminish? Now\n[1150.9s] people who have studed\n[1161.6s] business the one which is gotten by\n[1164.0s] labor does\n[1165.4s] what? It increases. Amen. Do you see\n[1169.2s] that there is the blessing of the Lord\n[1171.4s] in labor and not in idleness? The Lord\n[1175.6s] recognizes only one moment in a week\n[1178.5s] where you need to rest and that is the\n[1181.5s] Sabbath. You work for six days and then\n[1184.7s] you rest on Sabbath and that's what the\n[1187.0s] Lord wants and you will have your wealth\n[1189.8s] increase. You rest on the six\n[1193.2s] days and your wealth will diminish.\n[1196.6s] That's it. I didn't say that. It's the\n[1199.2s] Bible. Proverbs 21:25 the Bible says the\n[1203.0s] desire of the slothful killth him for\n[1206.6s] his ants refuse to\n[1208.8s] labor. The desire of the slothful. Now\n[1212.0s] we said the other day a slothful person\n[1214.1s] is a lazy\n[1218.4s] [Music]\n[1223.7s] person. So they\n[1226.3s] keeping because you do not have. So when\n[1229.3s] you pass, you say, \"Wow, what a nice\n[1231.2s] vehicle. I wish I had that\n[1233.3s] man. It will kill\n[1236.8s] you. If your hands will accept to\n[1240.9s] work, you will have it.\" Amen. I'll get\n[1244.4s] that quote someday\n[1246.7s] um before we finish this. It's on\n[1248.5s] councils on stewardship that the Lord\n[1250.9s] has placed in the heart of man the\n[1253.8s] desire to accumulate wealth and it's\n[1256.6s] godly. I'm not talking about those who\n[1259.3s] love the world. Talking about people\n[1261.1s] like Abraham who will not make their\n[1264.0s] wealth the object of their life. We\n[1267.5s] talking about such people. That desire\n[1269.6s] is divine to bring wealth together. And\n[1272.6s] wealth means what? It means what you\n[1274.8s] have, right? If it's clothes, if it is\n[1279.2s] food, is that wealth? Yeah. 21 26 it\n[1283.8s] says he coveted greedily all the day\n[1287.9s] long but the righteous giveth and\n[1290.4s] spareth not.\n[1292.3s] Amen. So the slothful\n[1295.9s] person covert\n[1299.0s] greedily\n[1300.5s] now greedily means what?\n[1313.3s] Soed greedy all the day long. So what's\n[1317.2s] the work of a slothful person? a lazy\n[1319.6s] person just sit down and imagine things\n[1323.0s] and keeps imagining like one time you\n[1325.7s] know these were the thoughts I used to\n[1326.9s] have when I used to go to school you\n[1328.7s] know because I was very ambitious and I\n[1331.1s] knew one time I'll have a very beautiful\n[1333.5s] big house very nice car living in a very\n[1337.0s] nice estate with very beautiful children\n[1339.4s] and beautiful wife attending in a\n[1341.6s] beautiful church those were always the\n[1343.6s] ideas you get the\n[1346.0s] point that's covetousness\n[1349.6s] And that's\n[1350.9s] laziness\n[1353.6s] because it is the truth\n[1356.4s] that there is nothing good that comes on\n[1359.8s] a\n[1360.8s] silver platter.\n[1362.9s] Amen. Yeah. That's a statement which\n[1366.1s] must can pass to be scriptures. That's\n[1368.3s] how it is. That's what the Bible says\n[1370.5s] here. If you are a lazy person, you keep\n[1374.2s] desiring. You keep coveting. And the\n[1376.9s] Bible doesn't want you to coveret. But\n[1379.1s] if you are laboring, you minimize the\n[1382.0s] moments of covetousness. Proverbs 14:23\n[1385.0s] says, \"In all labor there is\n[1389.1s] what? Profit.\" In all labor there is\n[1391.7s] what? Profit. But the talk of the lips\n[1395.8s] tended to what? Pen.\n[1419.4s] So the Bible calls us to labor and if\n[1423.9s] you labor there is profit. Amen.\n[1427.4s] No one should entertain the idea of\n[1429.8s] idleness\n[1433.3s] whatsoever. There are friends here and\n[1435.2s] you are hearing messages on true\n[1437.6s] education and you do not love going to\n[1440.0s] school because you do not love\n[1442.4s] reading and you don't love the school\n[1445.0s] program and then you think because you\n[1447.3s] heard this message now it's high good\n[1450.3s] time I got an opportunity to quit. You\n[1452.9s] get the point? So the reason for you to\n[1456.9s] choose true education is because you\n[1459.9s] found it an easy way to avoid work,\n[1464.5s] right? The Lord judgeth the\n[1468.0s] hearts. You see it so deep into your\n[1472.1s] heart. And if you want to make a\n[1474.3s] decision based on this\n[1476.6s] friend, you are just an\n[1479.6s] infidel. I will say to you personally\n[1482.9s] and advise you go back to school and\n[1486.2s] study. Did you get the\n[1489.0s] point? If you are making that\n[1492.5s] decision out of an avoidance of work, go\n[1498.3s] back. You are not sincere in your\n[1502.7s] heart. You are living a lie.\n[1508.3s] Abraham was not leaving his place\n[1511.9s] because he was avoiding work. You get\n[1514.7s] the point. I hope that one no one will\n[1517.6s] follow me late and say you are denying\n[1520.5s] the truth. I am telling you a message\n[1523.8s] that the Lord wants us to have in this\n[1526.5s] time because God wants us to be sincere\n[1529.1s] in our hearts. Not because we found it\n[1532.8s] easy to follow this direction is why we\n[1535.7s] left the other direction if that is the\n[1537.8s] reason the lord will judge the heart I\n[1541.1s] don't say further on that so we are told\n[1544.5s] the words of the lip they tend to penary\n[1548.2s] into\n[1549.6s] poverty and poverty enough I'll still\n[1553.1s] talk about\n[1554.6s] idleness uh when we'll talk about\n[1557.0s] self-sport proper that it is required of\n[1560.5s] every steward to be faithful in the\n[1563.0s] place where he is. Amen. So if the Lord\n[1565.8s] shall call you to be a mother, you be\n[1568.0s] faithful in your duties as a mother\n[1570.5s] without idleness or\n[1572.9s] laziness. 2 Thessalonians 3:10 the Bible\n[1575.9s] says, \"For even when we were with you,\n[1578.6s] this we commanded you, that if any will\n[1581.5s] not work, neither shall he do what\n[1585.1s] should\n[1586.0s] he should he eat.\n[1590.0s] For we hear that there are some which\n[1592.6s] walk among you\n[1594.1s] disorderly, walking not at\n[1597.2s] all, but are busy\n[1600.4s] bodies. Now them that are such we\n[1603.7s] command and exalt by our Lord Jesus\n[1606.1s] Christ, that with quietness they walk\n[1610.6s] and eat their own bread. Amen.\n[1616.2s] The Lord is calling us and because this\n[1619.2s] meeting is meant for the youth\n[1621.7s] primarily our generation is cast. We are\n[1625.4s] living at a gener generation of\n[1628.3s] idleness where people will not want to\n[1631.2s] work. People want to live. I'm not\n[1633.9s] talking about the church only. The rest\n[1636.0s] of the world people just want to live a\n[1638.5s] careless easy lifestyle. Is that a true\n[1641.1s] or false? We try to avoid work as much\n[1644.6s] as possible. Paul says when they were at\n[1647.8s] Thessalonica, what did they do? They\n[1650.2s] commanded them that those who do not\n[1653.1s] work should not do what? Should not\n[1656.1s] eat. And he says, \"For we hear that\n[1659.2s] there are some among you who are busy\n[1661.7s] bodies.\" You know what busy bodies\n[1664.0s] are? You\n[1674.9s] is about people who meddle with other\n[1677.0s] people's businesses. Someone is busy\n[1679.7s] doing their stuff, you are there busy\n[1682.3s] speaking about very many many things.\n[1685.2s] The Bible is saying to us that this life\n[1689.0s] of busy boding and especially speaks\n[1692.3s] categorically on women. When you go to\n[1695.6s] Timothy now he says this is the best\n[1698.0s] counel for us if you are found in such a\n[1700.6s] category he says we command and exalt\n[1703.5s] you by the lord do what in quietness go\n[1707.5s] and walk and eat your own bread.\n[1711.8s] Amen. The church should not\n[1716.4s] encourage laziness at all costs.\n[1720.3s] If someone is blessed with\n[1722.6s] strength, let them walk and eat their\n[1725.2s] own bread.\n[1727.2s] Amen. You know, we will still talk about\n[1730.5s] these things in depth for sure. But\n[1732.9s] that's the word of the Bible. Amen. He\n[1735.7s] said this time always passes quickly,\n[1737.7s] but today I'll catch up with it. Let's\n[1740.5s] uh we have a very wonderful reading here\n[1743.5s] on CT 277. We begin with paragraph 1.\n[1747.7s] I'll do some few readings and then I'll\n[1749.4s] just end. The things of earth are more\n[1753.0s] closely connected with heaven and are\n[1755.4s] more directly under the supervision of\n[1757.3s] Christ than many realize. The things of\n[1760.1s] the earth, we are told are connected\n[1762.2s] with the things of where heaven. Now you\n[1765.1s] know Christ is that ladder which\n[1767.0s] connects heaven and earth. And we are\n[1769.7s] told that Christ is\n[1772.9s] directly supervising these things than\n[1776.0s] we can ever realize. He says all right\n[1781.3s] inventions and improvements have their\n[1784.8s] source in him who is wonderful in\n[1787.5s] counsel and excellent in working. Amen.\n[1791.0s] All right. Inventions and\n[1795.6s] improvements. the person who invented\n[1797.8s] this light and it's the right one. The\n[1801.3s] Bible says it does it so\n[1803.3s] well. The other day just to remind you\n[1806.3s] perhaps we we can\n[1808.2s] forget we were created by the Lord.\n[1811.2s] Amen. Unless you guys believe in\n[1814.0s] evolution. If you believe in evolution\n[1816.5s] then you are exempted from thinking in\n[1819.1s] this manner. You can think the other way\n[1821.6s] around. But this is the thought. If you\n[1823.8s] are created by the Lord, you received\n[1825.9s] your life from who? From the Lord. And\n[1829.2s] every ability and every gift that you\n[1831.6s] have comes from who? From the Lord.\n[1834.2s] Sometimes we say it's natural as though\n[1837.4s] it invented itself across the way.\n[1840.3s] Evolution is the only way one which says\n[1843.8s] uh species keep acquiring uh advantages\n[1847.9s] over other species. But the Lord\n[1850.6s] equipped us with strength\n[1853.3s] uh and efficiency and intellect and all\n[1856.6s] these gifts which we can use. So if you\n[1859.1s] can invent\n[1861.5s] something the ability the intelligence\n[1864.6s] you are using came from who? From the\n[1867.3s] lord. We said every good gift comes from\n[1870.3s] where? From above from the lord of\n[1873.2s] lights. So we are told that every\n[1875.4s] invention and every improvement have the\n[1877.6s] associ him who is wonderful in counsel\n[1880.2s] and excellent in workings the skillful\n[1882.7s] touch of the physician's\n[1885.2s] hand. So the doctor when he\n[1888.8s] treats with that skillful hand we are\n[1892.2s] told his power and nerve and muscle is\n[1896.1s] knowledge of the delicate mechanism of\n[1898.2s] the body is the wisdom of divine power.\n[1901.4s] Amen. So if you have a thorough\n[1904.2s] knowledge on anatomy and physiology and\n[1906.7s] how all these things\n[1908.7s] work, it comes from where? From the Lord\n[1913.1s] to be used in behalf of the suffering.\n[1915.9s] So the Lord has equipped you to profit\n[1918.1s] with all. Amen. The skill with which the\n[1922.3s] carpenter uses his tools, the strength\n[1925.9s] with which the blacksmith makes the\n[1928.5s] anvil ring come from God. Amen. You\n[1932.0s] know, I'm reading these things and\n[1935.3s] uh my heart really melts because when\n[1938.1s] this message began, we didn't see these\n[1940.6s] things so clearly as they appear right\n[1942.8s] now.\n[1943.8s] Amen. The Lord is opening the path of\n[1946.7s] light. Doesn't the Bible says the path\n[1949.0s] of a righteous man\n[1950.8s] shineth further and farther unto the\n[1953.7s] perfect day? Amen. That's it. So the\n[1957.4s] Lord is saying if you are a\n[1959.7s] carpenter the skill that you have comes\n[1962.3s] from who? From the Lord. If you are a\n[1970.3s] blacksmith. That strength comes from\n[1972.6s] who? From the Lord. Whatever we do,\n[1977.4s] wherever we are placed, he desires to\n[1980.4s] control our minds that we may do perfect\n[1983.9s] work. Amen. So wherever the Lord will\n[1987.0s] place you, whatever you will do, the\n[1990.4s] Lord desires to control our minds. Amen.\n[1995.1s] Paragraph 2277 says, \"Christianity and\n[1999.2s] business rightly understood are not two\n[2002.3s] separate things. They are harmony.\"\n[2006.1s] You are not with me friends.\n[2010.0s] Inana Christianity and business rightly\n[2014.4s] understood are not two separate things.\n[2018.0s] They are\n[2019.5s] many. So Christianity and business are\n[2022.5s] many. They are\n[2024.5s] one. If you rightly understand them. If\n[2028.1s] you think they are two, it's because we\n[2030.4s] have not understood them. You get the\n[2032.1s] point.\n[2033.6s] Bible religion is to be brought into all\n[2036.8s] that we do and say. Human and divine\n[2040.8s] agencies are to combine in temporal as\n[2044.2s] well as spiritual achievements. So while\n[2046.8s] we cooperate with God on spiritual\n[2049.8s] matters which we do when we pray, when\n[2052.8s] we preach, when we study, when we do all\n[2055.4s] these things, we cooperate with God. And\n[2057.5s] so we must cooperate with him also on\n[2059.8s] the temporal when we go and farm and we\n[2061.9s] are digging and we are planting seed and\n[2064.0s] we are pushing the nails into the wood.\n[2067.1s] The Lord wants us to cooperate with him.\n[2069.3s] They are to be united in all human\n[2071.8s] pursuits in mechanical and in\n[2074.8s] agricultural labors in meantile and\n[2078.0s] scientific enterprises. Amen.\n[2083.4s] Higher than the highest human thought is\n[2086.9s] God's ideal for his children. That's a\n[2089.8s] very famous quote on\n[2091.8s] education. The Lord is not bringing us a\n[2095.0s] true education which is totally inferior\n[2098.2s] to the world. The Lord wants us that on\n[2101.0s] mechanics and on science and on\n[2105.6s] merchandise that mercantile means\n[2107.7s] merchandise, right? Business. The Lord\n[2110.9s] wants us to be the best of the best. I\n[2114.6s] believe this personally that the Lord is\n[2116.8s] not calling us to a true education which\n[2119.4s] is inferior to that one which the devil\n[2121.2s] has given to the world. What's the\n[2123.7s] biggest problem with false\n[2126.4s] education? It blends the truth with\n[2128.7s] what? With error so that you cannot\n[2131.4s] differentiate what is true and what is\n[2134.4s] false. And that's where a true education\n[2136.9s] comes and makes a correction. It is of a\n[2139.9s] truth that in false education there are\n[2143.4s] still elements of truth. Is that the\n[2145.7s] truth or false? Yeah, there are still\n[2148.1s] elements of truth. And that is why we\n[2150.2s] can still even find things which were\n[2152.8s] useful and they can still be used in the\n[2154.9s] service of who? Because the devil\n[2157.2s] managed to mingle what? Truth and what?\n[2160.2s] And error. And for sure while we also\n[2163.1s] drunk the\n[2164.4s] error, we also got some element of what?\n[2168.0s] of truth. So we are not like totally\n[2171.3s] saying it is totally\n[2173.9s] unfit. There are aspects of it which\n[2177.0s] were in reality good. Is that the truth?\n[2180.2s] But why should we go and partake the\n[2184.1s] whole thing when the Lord is providing\n[2187.2s] an option for that which is better\n[2190.2s] without leaving that which was good over\n[2192.0s] the other side. Over the other side.\n[2194.1s] Amen.\n[2196.1s] We have taken too long to implement true\n[2199.3s] education in its practical\n[2201.8s] aspect and that's why when we read such\n[2205.1s] statements they do not appear in their\n[2208.2s] true light but the Lord is calling out a\n[2210.7s] people who will make a straight stamina\n[2214.3s] not only in word of speaking about false\n[2218.0s] education but in real practice of what\n[2220.6s] it means to practice true education and\n[2223.1s] it shall be proven I am pastor\n[2225.6s] persed that before this arts history is\n[2229.2s] closed, the Lord will allow us to make a\n[2232.2s] clear demonstration of that practical\n[2234.7s] true education which he brought to his\n[2238.2s] people. It's been my prayer and I hope\n[2241.1s] one time we shall show it so that people\n[2243.7s] will not ask where shall we go from\n[2245.8s] here. The Lord will\n[2247.4s] say that's the place but we need to move\n[2251.2s] so hastily so that when we shall say\n[2253.5s] about mechanics and agriculture and\n[2255.8s] science and business it will be\n[2258.5s] practically in aspect that truly the\n[2261.0s] lord has given us that field let's read\n[2264.6s] further 21 paragraph 3 says there is a\n[2267.8s] remedy for indolence what's indolence\n[2272.1s] laziness and we have said this\n[2274.3s] generation is characterized by laziness.\n[2278.2s] We want to pick things which are easier\n[2280.3s] to do than those ones which are hard to\n[2283.1s] do. There is a remedy we are told and\n[2286.6s] that is to throw off sluggishness as\n[2290.5s] sin.\n[2292.7s] Sluggish.\n[2295.2s] Slugish. Like you want to do something\n[2298.1s] but you are what? You are sluggish. This\n[2302.3s] is the antidote for indolence.\n[2305.5s] Throw off all sluggishness as sin that\n[2308.6s] leads to pition. Just know that if I am\n[2312.1s] sluggish, I will be destroyed because\n[2314.9s] pition means to perish and go to work.\n[2318.6s] So you throw sluggishness and you go to\n[2320.6s] do what? To\n[2322.6s] work. Using with determination and vigor\n[2326.2s] the physical ability that God has given.\n[2329.0s] So if the Lord has given you physical\n[2330.5s] ability, use that to your determination.\n[2332.8s] The only cure for a useless, inefficient\n[2335.7s] life is determined, persevering effort.\n[2339.9s] So if you've been idle, the only way to\n[2342.3s] remedy that is to have a determined\n[2345.2s] persevering\n[2346.9s] effort. Life is not given us to be spent\n[2350.2s] in idleness or self-pleasing. You might\n[2354.1s] not be idol, but you might be choosing\n[2355.7s] things which are pleasing to you. Right?\n[2358.2s] The Lord doesn't want us to do that.\n[2360.2s] Before us are placed great possibilities\n[2362.6s] in the capital of strength. A precious\n[2365.0s] talent has been entrusted to men for\n[2367.4s] labor. So the Lord has committed you has\n[2370.4s] entrusted you a precious talent. This is\n[2373.6s] of more value than any bank deposit and\n[2376.7s] should be more highly priced for through\n[2379.1s] the possibilities that it affords for\n[2381.7s] enabling men to lead a useful happy life\n[2384.9s] it may be made to yield interest. says\n[2388.5s] the strength that the Lord has given you\n[2390.2s] is more valuable than the money you have\n[2393.4s] deposited in the\n[2396.7s] bank. You've heard this. I I I saw it\n[2400.5s] somewhere. Someone was asking if you are\n[2403.5s] asked to choose\n[2406.6s] between brain now because it was said\n[2409.7s] brain but let me just say knowledge and\n[2412.6s] money. Which one will you choose?\n[2418.8s] And\n[2419.9s] definitely we will choose money,\n[2427.5s] right? What about strength and money?\n[2430.5s] What will we\n[2433.9s] choose?\n[2435.7s] Money. Because the dominance of our\n[2439.0s] generation has taught us that money is\n[2441.2s] the main\n[2443.2s] thing. It's not friends. We need to\n[2446.8s] think again. The Lord wants us to be\n[2449.6s] useful in our lives. It's not just about\n[2452.4s] money. Even the ecclesiast writer said\n[2457.2s] the rest is not always to the fastest\n[2460.6s] nor battle to the strong. Then he says\n[2464.3s] time and\n[2465.7s] chance for everyone.\n[2468.6s] Sometimes we are engaging in business\n[2470.3s] and we are not very successful for sure\n[2473.7s] because the rest is not to the\n[2476.4s] past. So that does not mean because we\n[2480.2s] are not succeeding we should always\n[2482.3s] think about money only because on all\n[2484.8s] these things the Lord wants to make our\n[2486.6s] character. You see the main thing to be\n[2488.9s] gained is heaven. While on the long run\n[2491.7s] we can sustain ourselves on the\n[2493.4s] businesses that we earn. The main aim is\n[2496.3s] to gain heaven.\n[2499.4s] So that strength is of more value. You\n[2502.2s] can lead a more useful life, balanced\n[2504.8s] life than when you have\n[2507.4s] money. No man has a right to sacrifice\n[2510.9s] this talent to the corroding influence\n[2513.2s] of\n[2514.0s] inaction. All are as accountable for the\n[2516.8s] capital of physical strength as for\n[2518.6s] their capital of means. Now we said the\n[2521.1s] other day there are several talents. We\n[2523.3s] mentioned money. You remember that? We\n[2526.1s] mentioned strength too. You remember\n[2527.6s] that? So if the Lord commits to you\n[2529.9s] strength and not money, he will require\n[2532.2s] from you the use of strength. Now if you\n[2534.6s] are idol, how many of us for sure have\n[2537.4s] been blessed with strength, but we live\n[2539.0s] a very idol, useless life. How\n[2541.8s] many? Very many of us with a thought\n[2545.1s] that I am still in school. You see, I'm\n[2546.9s] studying. I'm going to work\n[2550.7s] later. The Lord wants us to use this\n[2553.6s] strength. Our schools of today have\n[2556.5s] become so\n[2558.0s] perverted that we think the brain is the\n[2560.6s] main thing and not the brain\n[2562.7s] actually it is the paper it is the\n[2565.6s] certificate because if it was the brain\n[2568.2s] there will be very many people even\n[2570.3s] sneaking into universities to acquire an\n[2573.0s] education so that they can use it in\n[2574.6s] practical lifestyle without a\n[2576.5s] certificate.\n[2578.0s] But are there such cases where people\n[2580.2s] sneak into the\n[2581.5s] university because it will be useless if\n[2584.1s] you don't have a paper? No one will\n[2585.4s] recognize you. You get the point. So\n[2587.6s] that the importance of the education of\n[2589.4s] today is only found where? In the paper.\n[2593.3s] Not in the person himself. But education\n[2596.5s] should be found in your brother. If it\n[2599.2s] is separate from you, it's useless.\n[2602.2s] That's why he says hold on after\n[2604.9s] education. Hold on it. Don't let it go.\n[2608.7s] That's what the Bible says. But if it's\n[2611.4s] packaged in a paper, that's as\n[2614.5s] useless as any other\n[2616.8s] paper. Because without the paper, you\n[2620.0s] cannot prove that you are\n[2622.4s] educated. You will need a certificate to\n[2624.6s] come before the Lord to say, I'm going\n[2627.7s] to bring my\n[2629.3s] degree. The Lord does not need that. The\n[2632.5s] Lord needs to equip us with education\n[2635.2s] itself. And that education should be in\n[2638.0s] us to be able to solve all practical\n[2640.4s] life problems. That's\n[2642.8s] it. I'm going forward. I just want to I\n[2646.6s] think I still have maybe two 10 minutes.\n[2650.9s] I have maybe two or three slides and I'm\n[2652.8s] done. Judicious labor is healthful tonic\n[2657.0s] for the human\n[2660.4s] race. Judicious means temporate. you are\n[2664.2s] not overwork because you were say we\n[2666.2s] said we should avoid both extremes where\n[2670.5s] the endeavor becomes just working for\n[2673.3s] money. So we should judicious labor is a\n[2676.2s] helpful tonic for the human\n[2685.6s] race. Amen.\n[2689.2s] It makes the feeble\n[2691.2s] strong, the poor rich, the wretched\n[2694.9s] happy.\n[2698.4s] Amen. Satan lies in ambush, ready to\n[2702.2s] destroy those whose leisure gives him\n[2705.7s] opportunity to approach them under some\n[2707.7s] attractive\n[2709.9s] disguise. He is never more successful\n[2712.6s] than when he comes to men in their idol\n[2715.0s] hours.\n[2716.3s] Satan lies in ambush and he is waiting\n[2718.8s] to get you when you are not aware and he\n[2721.4s] says he is always very successful when\n[2723.5s] we are idle but when we are busy even\n[2727.3s] the statement goes an idol\n[2730.6s] mind is the devil's workshop and I think\n[2734.7s] Luther said on the fundamentals of\n[2737.2s] education he\n[2738.5s] says the devil will find a work for idol\n[2743.3s] hands so if you are hands are idol the\n[2746.5s] devil will find a work for for\n[2751.2s] you. The essential lesson of contented\n[2755.3s] industry is in the necessary duties of\n[2758.3s] life is yet to be learned by many of\n[2762.2s] Christ followers. Let's redo that\n[2764.7s] statement again. The essential lesson of\n[2769.0s] contented industry in the necessary\n[2772.6s] duties of life is yet to be learned by\n[2776.6s] many of Christ followers. That statement\n[2780.2s] places the learning in future knowing\n[2784.4s] already that we have not learned this\n[2787.6s] essential knowledge of contented\n[2790.5s] industry.\n[2800.7s] You've heard very many parents say that\n[2802.9s] and they keep\n[2808.1s] saying because we really think that our\n[2811.3s] blessings from the Lord depend on\n[2813.8s] university papers. Many people think\n[2815.8s] that way, right? That without that\n[2818.2s] paper, the Lord is not going to do what?\n[2820.3s] To bless you. Go out and work.\n[2823.7s] Be a useful person. Don't love idleness.\n[2827.2s] But many people want to\n[2829.6s] study to minimize their work in future.\n[2832.6s] Not work. Are people going to study to\n[2835.6s] work? The problem is if you work hard\n[2839.0s] right now, you will\n[2841.1s] be relaxing in future. Right? And many\n[2844.6s] people are working hard in class to earn\n[2848.4s] idleness in future. We are yet to learn\n[2851.7s] as a people this essential lesson. It\n[2855.4s] requires more grace, more than\n[2858.2s] discipline of character to work for God\n[2860.6s] in the capacity of\n[2862.4s] mechanic, merchant, lawyer or farmer\n[2867.2s] carrying the precepts of Christianity\n[2869.0s] into the ordinary business of life than\n[2872.1s] to labor as an acknowledged missionary\n[2874.5s] in the open\n[2876.8s] field. You got the statement. Was that\n[2880.2s] right? Most of us desire to be\n[2882.2s] missionaries, acknowledged missionaries\n[2884.6s] in the open field. See, that's what we\n[2886.4s] desire. But we are told which one\n[2890.0s] requires more discipline of character.\n[2894.6s] Is it working as a missionary in the\n[2896.2s] open field? You know, when I'm a\n[2898.2s] missionary and I'm walking around,\n[2899.8s] everyone knows cuz gay is a missionary.\n[2901.6s] Hey, hello pastor. Hello missionary.\n[2904.2s] Hello to mission. I try to order my life\n[2907.5s] because I keep meeting people that I\n[2909.4s] speak about the gospel every now and\n[2911.1s] then. That's my chief work, you see. So\n[2914.0s] I rise up, I put on my suit, I put on my\n[2917.1s] tie, I take my Bible, I walk visiting\n[2919.8s] people and saying hello, Jesus loves\n[2921.8s] you. Jesus loves you. What about a\n[2925.1s] mechanic who has to deal with very many\n[2927.8s] types of people and he must be an honest\n[2930.9s] man and must witness for Christ\n[2934.9s] still. The Bible is calling us to this\n[2937.8s] persuasion that we should understand\n[2940.0s] that wherever the place the Lord will\n[2942.4s] place you, he requires you to work for\n[2944.8s] him as a missionary. Amen.\n[2947.4s] It is true that others will be called to\n[2949.8s] be missionaries in the field that will\n[2953.4s] be their chief work like Peter and\n[2956.1s] John who said friends should we stop\n[2959.7s] preaching the word and come and serve\n[2961.8s] the tables why don't you look for people\n[2963.9s] who can serve what the tables and when\n[2967.3s] they went to look for people who can\n[2968.5s] serve the the the tables sorry anyway\n[2971.5s] for sure in our place those words look\n[2974.1s] the same D and T and B and V and P they\n[2977.8s] are the same. So whichever comes in my\n[2979.6s] mouth just know what I'm trying to say.\n[2982.2s] So say should we look for those who are\n[2984.8s] going to serve the tables but those who\n[2986.2s] are going to serve the tables the\n[2987.8s] qualifications was that they must also\n[2989.4s] be spirit filled. Amen. And so if you're\n[2992.6s] going to work as a mechanic the lord\n[2994.6s] requires that you also must be a\n[2997.2s] spiritfilled person to work for him.\n[2999.0s] Amen. It requires a strong spiritual\n[3002.2s] nerve to bring religion into the\n[3004.1s] workshop and the business office\n[3006.6s] sanctifying the details of everyday life\n[3009.1s] and ordering every transaction according\n[3011.3s] to the standard of God's word. But this\n[3014.1s] is what the Lord requires. Amen. And we\n[3017.5s] said people are given many talents.\n[3028.2s] The Lord will require of\n[3034.4s] you. The Lord will require from you.\n[3037.4s] There will be no excuse. So if you are a\n[3040.8s] preacher and the Lord has given you also\n[3043.7s] the gift of\n[3045.7s] business, do business as you do what? As\n[3049.8s] you preach. Because the Lord, if you\n[3052.2s] will do business and you stop preaching,\n[3054.2s] the Lord will require from you the\n[3056.0s] talent of preaching. And if you will\n[3059.3s] preach and you leave business out, the\n[3061.7s] Lord will require from you the talent of\n[3063.1s] what? Of business. Did you get the\n[3065.3s] point? But others will be given one. Say\n[3069.5s] for example, a brother has been given\n[3071.0s] the talent of preaching. And it's only\n[3073.2s] one talent. All of us expect him to be\n[3076.3s] preaching. Amen. That's the only thing\n[3079.0s] that the Lord will require from\n[3095.6s] him. You understand that the Lord will\n[3099.0s] require from us the highest of what we\n[3101.6s] have heard. We must come to this\n[3103.4s] conviction and personally I'm persuaded\n[3105.8s] if we must preach the loud cry then all\n[3108.5s] the talents must be brought into the\n[3110.7s] work. Every part of our lives must be\n[3115.1s] touched because God will send business\n[3117.5s] people to that direction to that\n[3119.4s] direction because how will I preach to\n[3122.5s] the Muslims? Will I set up a crusade?\n[3124.5s] Will they listen?\n[3126.5s] But by my dealings, let me tell you one\n[3128.4s] time when I completed my form four and I\n[3130.7s] was doing a\n[3131.7s] business and God gave me a privilege\n[3135.7s] um to meet with a Muslim for sure. I'll\n[3138.3s] go to him. I was buying stuff. I was\n[3141.0s] doing food\n[3142.2s] business. So I will be buying stuff. He\n[3144.6s] was a wholesaler. So I'll go and buy. So\n[3147.1s] we became good friends. So I'll come and\n[3149.7s] say hey hello my I don't even remember\n[3151.5s] his name. Uh but he was a good brother.\n[3154.6s] Now one time he gave me a book. He said\n[3159.0s] to me, I have a book for you here. I see\n[3161.6s] that your heart is a very good. I will\n[3163.9s] give you this book. It was a Muslim\n[3165.5s] book. Now I had been praying that God\n[3167.8s] will give me an opportunity to speak to\n[3169.2s] this brother about the gospel. I thank\n[3171.8s] that he already observed\n[3174.4s] early that I was a good man. You get the\n[3177.0s] point. You know that's preaching already\n[3180.0s] and he will give me this book. While I\n[3182.5s] was still standing in the very very\n[3183.8s] shop, I was holding the book. The time\n[3185.4s] is over. All\n[3188.2s] right, I'll end it. I'm finishing the\n[3190.8s] story and I end it. I was still standing\n[3193.8s] on the counter and another pastor\n[3197.8s] uh he was coming from a Sunday\n[3200.7s] church and the pastor just came in. They\n[3204.6s] were also friends. And then when he saw\n[3206.4s] me with a book, he said, \"Oh, what's\n[3208.0s] that book?\" He took it and when he just\n[3211.0s] began holding it, the brother, the\n[3212.6s] Muslim brother just came and took the\n[3215.4s] book by force and he said this book I\n[3219.0s] gave it to him. It should not just be\n[3221.3s] held by any other\n[3225.1s] person. I understood at that moment how\n[3228.5s] much honor he gave to their book. It was\n[3230.5s] not a Quran. It was just an adapted book\n[3233.6s] giving some statements from the Quran.\n[3236.8s] uh but in that contact if you are going\n[3240.8s] to do business if we spend actually he\n[3242.7s] left so we didn't have very much time\n[3244.4s] together\n[3245.9s] afterwards we God will have brought me\n[3249.0s] into contact to the point that I could\n[3251.9s] minister to him because definitely once\n[3254.2s] he has observed that I am a good person\n[3257.0s] definitely he will also want to know\n[3259.4s] deeper if I said anything to him he will\n[3262.4s] easily accept he actually taught me how\n[3264.7s] to make rice\n[3266.6s] Yeah. And actually I tried and it worked\n[3268.6s] very well. So I agree that in business\n[3272.1s] we can really reach people and if the\n[3274.6s] Lord has given me that I really preach\n[3276.1s] from the pullpit for sure. I go for\n[3277.6s] public campaigns too. I also do little\n[3280.2s] medical missionary and I do media\n[3281.5s] ministry. That's what I do personally. I\n[3283.2s] also do a lot of other work on because\n[3285.8s] God really endored me in very many other\n[3288.1s] things. And I appreciate that the Lord\n[3290.6s] is calling for all these talents to\n[3292.4s] finish the work. Don't hide the talent\n[3295.2s] thinking that you must only work in a\n[3297.0s] single place because the Lord will\n[3299.2s] require the rest of the talents from\n[3301.2s] you. I believe this is the balance that\n[3303.0s] God is calling us to. The ministry will\n[3307.1s] not\n[3307.8s] suffer if we brought the talents will\n[3310.4s] it? I mean the work of the\n[3313.1s] Lord will not work will not go forward\n[3316.4s] because our talents to work for the\n[3318.3s] Lord.\n[3345.6s] Yeah. Let's pray.\n[3360.5s] Precious loving God in heaven, we thank\n[3362.2s] you and we praise you. You are speaking\n[3363.7s] to our dear hearts that we should give\n[3367.8s] unto God what belongs to God and unto\n[3369.8s] Caesar, what belongs to Caesar.\n[3372.4s] We have very many talents which we've\n[3374.2s] hidden for a long\n[3375.9s] time and some are very practical and\n[3378.6s] sometimes because of thinking they are\n[3380.1s] very secular. We have robbed you of\n[3382.6s] these talents. But Lord, you are calling\n[3384.6s] us as a people in these moments of the\n[3386.1s] loud cry to bring every gift to your\n[3389.3s] service. Now we have very young people\n[3391.9s] here with very\n[3394.1s] uh huge strengths. We pray Lord may they\n[3397.4s] be willing to surrender these strengths\n[3399.1s] to you that you may use them to further\n[3401.4s] their cause. Lord we pray give us\n[3404.6s] comfort and encouragement. There are\n[3406.8s] many things Lord that we have sacrificed\n[3409.0s] for the interest of the gospel and Lord\n[3412.1s] your promise is in this life we shall\n[3414.0s] get 100fold and even in the life to\n[3416.0s] come. Help to suffer loss to you we will\n[3419.4s] say if it were not for the gospel we\n[3420.9s] will be better. But Lord, help us to\n[3423.1s] know that we will say if it were not for\n[3424.7s] the gospel, we will be worse. I pray for\n[3427.9s] our church. Help us to awaken to this\n[3430.4s] realization, to say these opportunities,\n[3432.7s] and to further your cause and to finish\n[3434.3s] the work. Thank you for hearing our\n[3436.2s] prayers. We pray in the precious name of\n[3437.6s] Jesus Christ, your son. Amen. Amen.\n[3439.8s] Thank you. God bless you."

So this is the knowledge that is going to help us to prepare for this life and even for the life to come to come. So it is very important to know the God you worship. How shall we know God right? Then let us read philosophical speculation and scientific research in which God is not acknowledged are making skeptics of thousands Listen, philosophical speculation and scientific research in which God is not acknowledged are making skeptics of what? Thousands in the schools of today the conclusion that land men have reached as the result of their scientific investigation are carefully taught and fully explained. While the impression is distinctly given that if these land men are correct the Bible cannot be. So if what you are taught in the school about God by the philosophy of the schools is correct that the Bible is never going to be what to be true. Now which God is taught in the Babylonian schools in the schools of today is the one true God acknowledged. No. What about from primary school? He's the one true God acknowledged in secondary schools. What about in the higher schools, universities and colleges? He's the one true God acknowledged. No. But now listen the prophet says skepticism is attractive to the human mind. The youth see it an independence that captivates the imagination and they are deceived. Satan does what? Triumphs. He nourishes every seed of doubt that is sown in your in young hearts. He causes it to grow and bear fruit and soon harvest of infidelity is reaped. That is why the teachers of education are really understand what is education and make us understand why do we need education? Because today in the schools that we study in God is not acknowledged. But it is the will of Satan that he may triumph through the study of scientific investigation that will never help us understand who God is. All right? But for us to know God then we need to go back to the Bible and understand who God is. Now listen in C 94 paragraph 2 it says through success successive ages of darkness in the minute of athenism God permitted men to try the experiment of finding out God by their own wisdom not to demonstrate their ability to his certification but that men themselves might see that they could obtain a knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ his son saved through The revelation of what? His word by the Holy Spirit. Amen. So how are men supposed to understand God and his son Jesus Christ? It was through the revelation by his word. But it is gotten through the Holy Spirit. Do we how the prophet speaks? How am I supposed to know God? It is through the revelation of what? His word in the Bible. But now the only generating power that was supposed to help them understand who God is was the Holy Spirit. Now does the prophetist determine the Holy Spirit as a person? No. But you're going to find you're going to find. But it says when Christ came to the world by the wisdom by sorry when Christ came to the world the experiment had been fully tried and the result made it evident that the world by wisdom knew not who God. Even in the church God has allowed men to test down wisdom in this matter. But when a crisis has been brought about through human fability, God has risen mighty mightily to defend his people. When the church has been brought low, when trial and oppression have come upon his people, he more abundantly exalted them by the signal of deliverance. When unfaithful teachers came among the people, wickedness followed, and the faith of God's people seemed to win. But God arose and ped his flock and and and the tried and the true were lifted up. Now listen brethren my quotation then I'm going back to the scriptures. It says in testament to judge volume 5 that is which page? Which page? It says be therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also hath done what? Hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling s. Man by wicked work alienated himself from God. But Christ gave his life that all who would might be freed from sin reinstated in the favor of the creator. It was the anticipation of a redeemed holy universe that prompted Christ to make this great sacrifice. Have we accepted the privileges so dearly purchased? Are we followers of God? As their children or three servants of prince of darkness? Are we worshippers of Jehovah? Or of who? Or of who? Of the living God or idols? That's a question we are supposed to ask ourselves. Are we followers of the true living God or idols? The next paragraph says in paragraph 4 that no outward shrines may be visible that no outward shines shrines may be visible. There there may be no image for the eye to rest upon yet we may be practicing what? Idolatry. What is idolatry? Many of us thinks that idolatry is when someone makes something like a cow, something in form of Maria to worship. But now EG White says through the pen of inspiration that no outward may be visible. There may be no image of the eye to rest upon yet we may be practicing what? Idolatry. It is an easy to make an idol of cherished ideas or objects as to fashion gods of hood and what? So that means again we can make idols of what? Cherished ideas. Yeah, very true. And today we are going to see in the reformation movement that are rising that many of the reformation movement are making idols of cherished ideas. They are not bringing up their doctrine from the Bible as the only creed. Now listen brother and sister thousands have a false conception of God and his what attributes? How many? Many are not understanding who God is and they have a false conception of God and his attributes. It says there are as very status of false god as the servant of Bal. Now listen, are we worshiping the true God as as is revealed in his word in Christ? Amen. Question. Do we worship the true God as this God is revealed in the word? By who? By Christ. Now what did Christ came to reveal to us? Christ came to reveal who to us the father. Christ came to give us the perfect character of who? Of the father. Was there sin in Christ? No. Why? God was manifested in the flesh. That's a stat that you need to understand that for the people living in the last days for us to live the life of Christ then again God must be manifested in the flesh. Amen. It says they are as serving a false god as the servants of Bal. Are we worshiping the true God as is revealed in his word in [Applause] Christ in nature or are we adoring some philosophical idols enshrined in his place? God is a God of what? Truth, justice and mercy are the attributes of his throne. He is a God of love, of pity and of tender compassion. Thus he is represented in his son our savior. He is a god of patient and longsuffering. If such is the being whom we adore and to whose character we are seeking to assimilate, we are worshiping the true God who is revealed in the Bible by his son Jesus Christ. And that is the God that we seek to worship. Not a God that is cherished by people by their own ideas. But you worship a God who Christ came to manifest in his word is the God we worship. Brethren, understanding the third person of the Godhead. Amen. Though some of us has been waiting for that such a long time, date has come. Amen. It is here. Now, let's turn back to our Bibles. Leave alone the quotation. Turn to your Bibles please so that you study the Bible and understand what the Bible says. Now we go before the Bible. Allow me read this verse. Then now we come to the Bible principle. Then I come back to the quotation. Then we understand. Amen. Now it says in describing to his disciples the office work of all. I want to take that point that Christ was describing the office work. Do you understand the meaning of office? You will understand brothers and sisters there is delegates to work in that office. We are going to see in describing to his disciples the office work of the Holy Spirit. Jesus sought to inspire them with the joy and hope that inspired his own heart. Amen. He rejoiced because of the abundant help he had provided for his church. The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gift. Amen. Now the Holy Spirit is a gift. Do we listen? The highest gift that Christ could give to his church was what? The Holy Spirit. That's a point. A gift. We are going to see the gift was the highest of all gifts that he consolidated from his father for the exaltation of his people. The spirit was to be given as a regenerating what? Agent. And without this, the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. The power of evil had been strengthening for centuries. And the submission of what? Of men to this satanic captivity was amazing. Now listen the quotation. Sin could not be resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the third person of the godhead who will not come with no modified energy but in the fullness of divine power. Are you together brethren? Some are sleeping. Is this thing projected? I'm not seeing the projector now. Listen, brethren, sin could be resisted. Listen, sin could be resisted and overcome only. Now the quotition says, it means this is the only way that strain could be done. What? resisted through the mighty agency of the third person of the godhead. But now from Christ we saw that the personalities that Christ is only himself, God, angels and man. But now each word says that it again another person called the third person of what? The godhead. But now we have to ask Christ why in your word you are not reh revealing to us that indeed there's a third person in your sayings you only tell us you know three personalities but now listen brethren in the book of Zechariah chapter 6 verse 13 we need to understand why is the bible is the spirit of prophecy speaking with the third person of the godhead one Christ in his word identifies only for personalities is Zechariah chapter 6 verse 13 the Bible says even shall be the temple of the Lord even he shall be the temple of the Lord who is that that Christ himself even he shall be the temple of what of the Lord have you opened your Bibles yes yes let's read together even he shall be the temple of who? And he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his what? And he shall be a priest upon his what? Throne. And the council of peace shall be between them both. Now the council of peace is between Christ himself and who? The father. Is that the third person? Is that the third person? No. Turn to the book of Genesis. We see cuz this is another verse that people use to prove from the Bible that this trinity doctrine. But now let's see in Genesis 1 26 the Bible reads, \"And God said, let us make man in our own what? image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fall of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon what? The earth. Now God speaks and saying, \"Now let us make man in our own image, and who is in the image of God.\" The book of Colossians chapter 1 verse one. These are verses that you know. Let's open Colossians 1:16. The Bible says who is there? Colossians 1 it says verse 15 says who is the image of the invisible God of Egypt. Who is that? That Christ himself is in the image of who? of the invisible God. Verse 16 says, \"For by him are all things created.\" So by whom did God create all things? By Christ. Then who is in the image of the invisible God? Has anyone in this congregation ever read where the Bible says that the Holy Spirit who is in the image of the invisible God? Help me brethren. Who has read that? that the Holy Spirit who is a in the image of invisible God is that writing like that in the Bible who has read such a thing in the Bible can help us understand it is not we are very sure that it is only Christ who is in the image of who invisible God now when God says let us create man in our own image who was God speaking to Christ himself. You read the book of Proverbs 8:22 going downward says that Christ was with the father in the cre in the creation. Was there the third person called God the Holy Spirit? No, the Bible don't reveal that it was Christ who was by the side of the father during the creation what the creation work. Now the only person who can enter into council with the father is who is Christ himself. That the council of peace shall be between them both. Now listen brethren turn to PP. Let's check that is not in the projector but we read it. Not everything is written. So God also brings some quotations as we continue so that you understand the book of PP that is part and prophets. Yeah. That is page 34. The sovereign of the universe is page 34. Sure. Now it says the sovereign of the universe. That is 34 paragraph 1. Listen this brethren. The sovereign of the universe was not alone in his work of beneficiaries. He had a associate a coworker who could appreciate his what? His purposes. Now the sovereign of the universe God the father he was not alone in his work of what of creation. Then she says that he had an associate a coworker who could appreciate his work. He had a coworker. Check the grammar. Does the spirit of prophecy says that he had coworkers? He had a co worker with a few English. I know the little English I know. I know that is that is something that is not plural but singular. Sure. Now it says that he had an associate single a coworker who could appreciate his purposes and could share his joy in giving happiness to the created what beings. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. Christ. Now listen brother and sister. Christ the word of God the only begotten of God was one with eternal father. One in what? Nature. Nature. One in character in purpose. The only being all the purposes of God. Are we together? that the only being that could enter into the councils and purposes of God was who was Christ. Now, where was this third person of the Godhead? Where are so many of us thought that you see there's the third person of the Godhead? There's another being called the Holy Spirit. Is that true? Is that true? Because the spirit of prophecy says that the only being that will enter into the council and the purpose of God was who was Christ himself. Amen. Now when God is doing his work of beneficial who was with him as a coworker is Christ himself there was not another being. But now we are coming back to the quotation. Why is EG saying that sin could only be resisted by the mighty agency of the third person of the Godhead? What does she mean by saying this? And we're going to look at some more quotations. What was this woman meaning? You have to study this woman rightly and understand how she writes and ammonize all the quotations that she's giving us because I believe could not give us something that is an error. Is that very true? He was led by the spirit of what? The spirit of God. Now it is us to study what did she mean? Many of us run to these quotations and say now you see the spirit of prophecy of the godhead. Now there are three beings in heaven. But now the Bible says that the only being who could enter into the councils and the purposes of God was who was Christ himself. Turn to great controversy. The book great controversy. Another proof that is being given from the spirit of prophecy that we have only two beings who came into one council to bring the council of peace into the earth. Now listen 493 paragraph 1. It says before the entrance of evil there was peace and joy throughout the universe. Amen. All was in perfect harmony with the creator's will. Love for God was supreme. Love on one another impartial. That is 493 brethren and sisters. 493 paragraph 1. Great controversy. It says before the entrance of evil there was peace and what joy throughout the universe always in perfect harmony with the creator's will. Love for God was supreme. Love for one another in passion. Christ the word, the only begotten of God was one with whom? Eternal father, one in nature, in character, in purpose, the only being in all the universe who could enter into the council into all the councils and purposes of God. Now listen brethren the only being in all the universe now is the only being who could enter into the council and purposes of God is Christ himself. Amen. Now come back to your Bible because you have realized that the only being who could enter into the council and purposes of Jehovah is Christ is what? So is there a person called God the Holy Spirit who engage in the work of creation? No. There were only two who did the work of creation. Now come back to your Bible. Now let us turn to the book of second Peter. You want to see yesterday we got that in the Bible precept the Holy Spirit can speak. Sure. That was the book of Acts 13:2. And the Holy Ghost said, we want to look how is this possible? How does a thing that doesn't have form speaks? How is something that is a being speaks? We are to be sure from the word of God. Now, let's turn to the book of second Peter chapter 1 19. We see in many aspects of the Bible, it says, Yeah, we have also a word of prophecy that we have also a word of prophecy where you look Uhhuh. life in that place. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. In your heart. Sure. Knowing this fact, now knowing this fact that no prophecy of the scripture is any private interpretation. That no prophecy of the scriptures is of any private inition. Read verse 21. The prophecy came not in the will. That prophecy came not in all time by the will of man. But holy men of God, that holy men of God, I want you to understand how the Bible is written. Now Peter says that the holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. It mean everything they spake was from God. They were filled with the Holy Spirit and then they spoke the words of who? The words of God. It may be possible when I say okay let me not first bring that principle but now turn to again the book of John chapter 14. I want to bring that principle later. The book of John chapter 14. No, let's first check John 15 first. Check this principles of the Bible. John 15:26. Bible says the comforter is now listen. But now when the comforter is come and who is the comforter? Who is the comforter? Who is the comforter? Someone saying Christ. I'm the Holy Spirit. Yeah, we'll see that. That always very true. Now read brother. But now when the comforter is come from the father whom the father is going to send from the father even the spirit even the spirit of truth proceedth from the father. Then this spirit proceedth from who? It shall testify of me. This spirit shall testify of of me. Now listen brethren that when that comforter come even the spirit of truth he shall testify of me he shall personality can I say that a lawyer it come in the house grammatical in in any sense that brother it went it went and it came it is very impossible but now the bible say that when that water come, whomever will send unto you from the father, even the spirit of truth which proceedth from the father, he shall testify of me. Why in the Bible have you ever read the spirit testifying of Christ? What am I doing here? What am I doing here? But what is Christ says that when that spirit comes, he shall testify of what? Who has ever seen the Holy Spirit testifying? Who has ever seen? I read somewhere that that spirit came and it was testifying and people were moved by the word of who has ever read such a thing. Now listen, brethren, let us see. There are those who testify of Jesus. Number one principle, turn to the book of Revelation. and take that to be your mind that when the spirit of truth come even the comforter he shall testify of me when the Bible have you ever read the spirit testify of the Christ himself No. 22:16 the book of Revelation. Jesus sent my angel. Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the midst of churches. Amen. Now who is testifying here? But what did Christ say that? Who did Christ say that will testify of him? But now Revelation says that it is the angel. This is Christ still speaking himself that he has seen his angel to testify and what these things. But the same speaks in John chapter 15 that the spirit of truth even the converter shall testify of me who is testifying. Now listen brethren turn the book of acts 1 vers8 you have to understand what Christ was meaning 18 acts 1 vers8 now listen Christ said but he disciples shall receive power and after the holy ghost is come upon you he shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of what? Now Christ says, \"But he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon what? Then he shall do that that what? Witness or testify of me only after the Holy Spirit comes unto you.\" It is very true when I say that the Holy Spirit was testifying of Christ in the days of the apostles. Is that very true? Yes. But now he's testifying of the apost of Christ himself through the apostles. Why? Because preaches can testify but it can only witness and testify inside a believer or an angel. Are we together? Now listen, stand to this book. I'm coming back to the Bible. I'm not running from the Bible. That's the same quotation in 29 page 34. This is true quotation. Those who have here sometimes saying these things were added. This is manuscript volume 2 page 34 paragraph 1. that evil had been accumulating for centuries and could only be restrained and assisted by the mighty power of what? The Holy Spirit. The third person of what? The who could come with no modified energy. Listen, there's this spirit does not come with its own modified energy, but in the fullness of what? Divine power. Another spirit must be met for the essence of evil was working in all ways and the submission of man to his what? Satanic captivity was amazing. The same in 1888 materials page 49 1493 paragraph 2 says evil had been accumulating for centuries and could only be restrained and resisted now in each and every quotations using white ads some vocabulary and English. He she says he evil had been accumulating for centuries and could only be restrained and resisted by the mighty power of what? The Holy Spirit, the third person, the Godhead who could come with no modified energy but in the fullness of divine power. The mighty agency in CTR Christ triumphant page 301 paragraph number one. How many witnesses are those in the quotations? Now can you say this quotation was added? No. It is there the Bible and it came from the lips of each. It says Christ determined to bestow a gift of those who had been with him and who should believe on him because this was the equation of his ascension and inaugression and to believe in heaven. What gift could Christ bestow rich enough to signalize and grace his ascension to the medial throne? It must be worthy of his greatness and his royality. Christ gave his representative the third person of the godhead, the holy what? Spirit. And this gift could not be done what? This thing is a gift. It is a gift. Take that. And how do God bestow gift unto his people? Through which process? Through which process? How do we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit? Do they come direct from the father? What is the order? It comes from the father, the son. Then the ministation of what? All the angels. It is a gift. The Holy Spirit is a gift that is given unto us. Turn back to your Bible, brethren. There is the third person of the godhead. Last time the book of John chapter 14 and veil we are coming back still. This is something that is very easy to explain in the Bible. Now the book of John chapter 14. Let us take verse number 15 says, \"If you love me, keep my commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another what that he personality he may abide with you forever. Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him what? Never knoweth him not but he know him.\" How to listen bre what Christ says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that is the holy spirit sure that we may abide with you forever forever even the spirit of truth now listen brethren turn to the book of matthew we are coming back there is precept upon precept 28 verse 19 that you The Bible reads 28 verse 19, the book of Matthew. Go therefore, teach all nations. Uh-huh. Know the Son, not the Holy Ghost. Yeah. Yeah. Always even unto the end of the world. Now Christ says long I Christ I am with you always even unto the end. Now who was supposed to remain the disciples until the end of the world? Is Christ himself in the book of Matthew? Are we together? But now listen in 14:16 he says even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot do what? receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him not but he know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I don't know much English not learned such as you people not learned but I understand what the Christ is saying now Christ says that this comforter will abide with them forever then Matthew 28 19 and 20 Christ says that me Christ I shall be with you even unto the end of the world. Christ himself speaking. But now Christ speaks of the spirit and saying that this spirit will b with you forever even unto the end of what? The world. Then verse 17, Christ says that even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not yet never knoweth him but he know him for he dwelleth with you now. Sure. For he does what? Dwelleth with you. Now as he speaks, that spirit dwells with what? With you. But again he says and shall be in you. That is what? In the future. Now that dwells with them as he speaks with them. But now he says but later he will be in you. Do we understand? Do you understand? Oh, listen brethren. Turn down to your phones. Open the quotations. We are harmonizing the scriptures in the spirit of prophecy cuz my time is up. Oh brother. Okay, let me read the last quotation. Now I want to read a book that most of you I don't know if you have it in your phones. Now we are so used to the red estate. Now I want to read from letters and manuscript. Letters and manuscript. Allow me look for it brother. Okay.

If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth all men li liberally and apprenth not. And it shall be given him, but let him act in what? In faith, nothing wavering. James 1:5 and 6. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. And we know that the son of God is come, that is Christ himself, the son of God, and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. Little children, keep yourself from others. Then the Bible says in 1 John 5 21, the Lord is soon to come. We want that complete and perfect understanding which the letter alone can give. Now listen brothers and sisters, it is not safe to catch the spirit from another. It is not safe to do what? To catch the spirit from another. We want the Holy Spirit which is Jesus Christ. Are we together? that we want the Holy Spirit to reach. Listen to the grammar that this woman had. I'm praying. We want the Holy Spirit to which is Jesus Christ. If you commune with God, we shall have strength and grace and efficiency. Amen. Now, who is the Holy Spirit? I'll continue from there as we be looking. What did EG White mean by saying that seal could only be resisted only through the mighty agency of the third person of what? But now the spirit of truth that Christ is promising to his disciples is he himself manifested in what? In the person of his spirit. Amen. Are we together? How many are following this? Allow me see. know you can be teaching a big class and how many just carry up and be be very I'm seeing brethren how many are saying man not understanding this I'm still confused sure sister you'll speak and I'll give chance for questions now let us pray then I believe tomorrow God will give us another chance to continue in Jesus We are praying. Our father in heaven, we thank you for this day. Thank you for giving me strength to speak unto thy children. Indeed, I'm unworthy to stand before such a congregation because of our sinfulness. But father because of thy graces you still allow us to preach these mighty truths and holy truths. We pray that each and every time we study this truth help us father that even ourselves you'll be sanctified through the truth. That father one day as you come in the glory of thy angels, the glory of thy father and the glory that you have. We might stand firm to say this is our God that you have been waiting for. I pray for the brethren listening unto these messages. Indeed, this is a powerful convention which youths are deciding to walk in the truth. How I pray that you help both of us to stand firm upon the platform of eternal truth as we'll be continuing this study. Father, I pray that you help us understand who you are right because we know that the only topic that will help us overcome sin and live a purity of life is to know they are right. I pray for those who are in this all women, children, youths, men that father give us strength to know their right. Help us to study our Bibles and help us to be of humble spirit to be taught by thee that you know who you are. The programs that remain in this day, the teachings we have, Father, we pray that you help us to take them seriously. That father we might say that at the end of this convention that indeed it was very powerful and God was with us through his ministration of all the angels above with us. Father help us to understand more and more in thy scriptures and above. Father we pray that we daily help us to claim upon thy promises and trust in the righteousness of thy son that we live a holy life is our prayer by faith in Jesus holy name. Amen.",
        "timestamped_transcript": "[1.0s] Paragraph number three says of ministry\n[4.2s] page 49 transformation of\n[7.3s] character purity of life efficiency in\n[12.1s] service knowledge is the essential\n[14.7s] preparation for a preparation both for\n[18.0s] this life and for the life to\n[21.0s] come. So this is the knowledge that is\n[23.6s] going to help us to prepare for this\n[27.6s] life and even for the life to come to\n[31.1s] come. So it is very important to know\n[35.8s] the God you worship. How shall we know\n[38.3s] God right? Then let us read\n[41.8s] philosophical speculation and scientific\n[43.8s] research in which God is not\n[46.3s] acknowledged are making\n[48.6s] skeptics of thousands\n[52.8s] Listen, philosophical speculation and\n[55.4s] scientific research in which God is not\n[58.7s] acknowledged are making skeptics of\n[61.2s] what? Thousands in the schools of today\n[64.8s] the conclusion that land men have\n[67.0s] reached as the result of their\n[68.5s] scientific investigation are carefully\n[71.6s] taught and fully explained. While the\n[74.9s] impression is distinctly given that if\n[77.5s] these land men are correct the Bible\n[80.1s] cannot be. So if what you are taught in\n[82.8s] the school about God by the philosophy\n[86.1s] of the schools is correct that the Bible\n[88.6s] is never going to be what to be true.\n[92.2s] Now which God is taught in the\n[94.7s] Babylonian schools in the schools of\n[97.2s] today is the one true God\n[99.7s] acknowledged. No. What about from\n[102.3s] primary school? He's the one true God\n[105.2s] acknowledged in secondary schools. What\n[108.6s] about in the higher schools,\n[109.9s] universities and colleges? He's the one\n[112.2s] true God acknowledged. No. But now\n[115.3s] listen\n[116.2s] the prophet says skepticism is\n[119.4s] attractive to the human mind. The youth\n[122.2s] see it an independence that captivates\n[125.0s] the imagination and they are deceived.\n[127.4s] Satan does what? Triumphs. He nourishes\n[131.2s] every seed of doubt that is sown in your\n[133.4s] in young hearts. He causes it to grow\n[135.9s] and bear fruit and soon harvest of\n[140.8s] infidelity is reaped. That is why the\n[144.5s] teachers of education are\n[147.4s] really understand what is education and\n[151.9s] make us understand why do we need\n[154.5s] education? Because today in the schools\n[157.4s] that we study in God is not\n[160.0s] acknowledged. But it is the will of\n[162.2s] Satan that he may triumph through the\n[165.5s] study of scientific investigation that\n[168.5s] will never help us understand who God\n[171.2s] is. All right? But for us to know God\n[174.2s] then we need to go back to the Bible and\n[178.0s] understand who God is. Now listen in C\n[182.6s] 94 paragraph 2 it says through success\n[186.8s] successive ages of darkness in the\n[189.4s] minute of athenism God permitted men to\n[192.5s] try the experiment of finding out God by\n[195.8s] their own wisdom not to demonstrate\n[198.3s] their ability to his certification but\n[201.8s] that men themselves might see that they\n[204.6s] could obtain a knowledge of God and of\n[207.1s] Jesus Christ his son saved through The\n[209.9s] revelation of\n[211.2s] what? His word by the\n[214.3s] Holy Spirit. Amen. So how are men\n[218.8s] supposed to understand God and his son\n[221.3s] Jesus Christ? It was through the\n[225.2s] revelation by his word. But it is gotten\n[229.4s] through the Holy Spirit. Do we how the\n[232.4s] prophet\n[233.5s] speaks? How am I supposed to know God?\n[236.6s] It is through the revelation of what?\n[239.4s] His word in the Bible. But now the only\n[243.2s] generating power that was supposed to\n[246.1s] help them understand who God is was the\n[249.0s] Holy\n[250.0s] Spirit. Now does the\n[252.9s] prophetist determine the Holy Spirit as\n[255.3s] a\n[256.8s] person? No. But you're going to find\n[259.8s] you're going to find. But it says when\n[262.4s] Christ came to the world by the wisdom\n[264.6s] by sorry when Christ came to the world\n[268.4s] the experiment had been fully tried and\n[271.4s] the result made it evident that the\n[274.3s] world by wisdom knew not who\n[278.5s] God. Even in the church God has allowed\n[281.4s] men to test down wisdom in this matter.\n[284.3s] But when a crisis has been brought about\n[286.6s] through human fability, God has risen\n[290.3s] mighty mightily to defend his people.\n[293.6s] When the church has been brought low,\n[295.6s] when trial and oppression have come upon\n[298.4s] his people, he more abundantly exalted\n[301.0s] them by the signal of deliverance. When\n[303.1s] unfaithful teachers came among the\n[305.4s] people, wickedness followed, and the\n[307.8s] faith of God's people seemed to win. But\n[310.7s] God arose and ped his flock and and and\n[314.4s] the tried and the true were lifted up.\n[319.0s] Now listen brethren my quotation then\n[322.2s] I'm going back to the scriptures. It\n[324.2s] says in testament to judge volume 5 that\n[327.4s] is which\n[328.8s] page? Which\n[331.2s] page? It says be therefore followers of\n[334.6s] God as dear children and walk in love as\n[339.0s] Christ also hath done what? Hath loved\n[342.3s] us and hath given himself for us an\n[345.3s] offering and a sacrifice to God for a\n[348.2s] sweet smelling s. Man by wicked work\n[352.1s] alienated himself from God. But Christ\n[355.0s] gave his life that all who would might\n[357.9s] be freed from sin reinstated in the\n[360.5s] favor of the creator. It was the\n[363.4s] anticipation of a redeemed holy universe\n[366.6s] that prompted Christ to make this great\n[369.0s] sacrifice. Have we accepted the\n[371.2s] privileges so dearly purchased? Are we\n[373.7s] followers of God? As their children or\n[377.6s] three servants of prince of darkness?\n[380.0s] Are we worshippers of Jehovah? Or of\n[384.9s] who? Or of\n[388.2s] who? Of the living God or\n[393.0s] idols? That's a question we are supposed\n[395.7s] to ask\n[396.7s] ourselves. Are we followers of the true\n[399.3s] living God or idols?\n[402.8s] The next paragraph says in paragraph 4\n[405.3s] that no outward shrines may be\n[408.1s] visible that no outward shines\n[411.5s] shrines may be visible. There there may\n[415.4s] be no image for the eye to rest upon yet\n[418.2s] we may be practicing what?\n[421.4s] Idolatry. What is idolatry? Many of us\n[423.8s] thinks that idolatry is when someone\n[426.1s] makes something like a cow, something in\n[428.9s] form of Maria to worship. But now EG\n[433.0s] White says through the pen of\n[434.6s] inspiration that no outward may be\n[437.6s] visible. There may be no image of the\n[440.0s] eye to rest upon yet we may be\n[442.2s] practicing what? Idolatry.\n[445.4s] It is an easy to make an idol of\n[447.4s] cherished ideas or objects as to fashion\n[450.7s] gods of hood and what? So that means\n[453.9s] again we can make idols of what?\n[457.2s] Cherished\n[458.8s] ideas. Yeah, very true. And today we are\n[462.5s] going to see in the reformation movement\n[464.6s] that are rising that many of the\n[466.6s] reformation movement are making idols of\n[470.5s] cherished ideas. They are not bringing\n[473.4s] up their doctrine from the Bible as the\n[476.6s] only creed. Now listen brother and\n[478.3s] sister thousands have a false conception\n[481.8s] of God and his what attributes? How\n[486.2s] many? Many are not understanding who God\n[490.7s] is and they have a false conception of\n[493.8s] God and his attributes. It says there\n[497.1s] are as very status of false god as the\n[500.9s] servant of Bal. Now\n[507.8s] listen, are we worshiping the true God\n[511.4s] as as is revealed in his word in Christ?\n[515.9s] Amen. Question. Do we worship the true\n[519.1s] God as this God is revealed in the word?\n[521.7s] By who? By Christ. Now what did Christ\n[525.4s] came to reveal to\n[530.8s] us? Christ came to reveal who to\n[534.5s] us the father. Christ came to give us\n[537.8s] the perfect character of who? Of the\n[540.3s] father. Was there sin in Christ? No.\n[543.3s] Why? God was manifested in the flesh.\n[547.8s] That's a stat that you need to\n[549.1s] understand that for the people living in\n[551.4s] the last days for us to live the life of\n[554.3s] Christ then again God must be manifested\n[558.0s] in the\n[558.9s] flesh. Amen. It says they are as serving\n[563.5s] a false god as the servants of Bal. Are\n[566.8s] we worshiping the true God as is\n[569.4s] revealed in his\n[572.0s] word in\n[573.3s] [Applause]\n[575.2s] Christ in nature or are we adoring some\n[579.8s] philosophical idols enshrined in his\n[582.1s] place? God is a God of what? Truth,\n[585.8s] justice and mercy are the attributes of\n[588.5s] his throne. He is a God of love, of pity\n[591.5s] and of tender compassion. Thus he is\n[594.4s] represented in his son our savior. He is\n[597.6s] a god of patient and longsuffering. If\n[600.9s] such is the being whom we adore and to\n[604.2s] whose character we are seeking to\n[606.1s] assimilate, we are worshiping the true\n[610.4s] God who is revealed in the Bible by his\n[613.4s] son Jesus\n[615.0s] Christ. And that is the God that we seek\n[617.5s] to worship. Not a God that is cherished\n[620.8s] by people by their own ideas. But you\n[623.5s] worship a God who Christ came to\n[626.1s] manifest in his word is the God we\n[628.9s] worship. Brethren, understanding the\n[631.1s] third person of the Godhead. Amen.\n[633.2s] Though some of us has been waiting for\n[634.6s] that such a long time, date has come.\n[637.9s] Amen. It is\n[639.9s] here. Now, let's turn back to our\n[642.7s] Bibles. Leave alone the quotation. Turn\n[645.6s] to your Bibles\n[648.4s] please so that you study the Bible and\n[653.2s] understand what the Bible says. Now we\n[657.2s] go before the Bible. Allow me read this\n[660.1s] verse. Then now we come to the Bible\n[663.9s] principle. Then I come back to the\n[666.3s] quotation. Then we understand. Amen.\n[669.6s] Now it says in describing to his\n[673.2s] disciples the office\n[676.3s] work of\n[678.4s] all. I want to take that point that\n[682.2s] Christ was describing the office\n[686.1s] work. Do you understand the meaning of\n[690.2s] office? You will understand brothers and\n[692.5s] sisters there is delegates to work in\n[694.6s] that office. We are going to see in\n[697.0s] describing to his disciples the office\n[699.0s] work of the Holy Spirit. Jesus sought to\n[701.8s] inspire them with the joy and hope that\n[704.5s] inspired his own heart. Amen. He\n[707.8s] rejoiced because of the abundant help he\n[711.0s] had provided for his church. The Holy\n[713.8s] Spirit was the highest of all gift.\n[716.0s] Amen. Now the Holy Spirit is a\n[719.9s] gift. Do we listen?\n[723.0s] The highest gift that Christ could give\n[726.2s] to his church was what? The Holy\n[730.3s] Spirit. That's a point. A gift. We are\n[733.7s] going to\n[735.5s] see the gift was the highest of all\n[738.7s] gifts that he consolidated from his\n[741.7s] father for the exaltation of his people.\n[745.8s] The spirit was to be given as a\n[748.2s] regenerating what? Agent. And without\n[751.5s] this, the sacrifice of Christ would have\n[753.6s] been of no avail. The power of evil had\n[756.5s] been strengthening for centuries. And\n[759.3s] the\n[760.3s] submission of what? Of men to this\n[763.8s] satanic captivity was amazing. Now\n[766.5s] listen the quotation. Sin could not be\n[769.3s] resisted and overcome only through the\n[772.4s] mighty agency of the third person of the\n[776.7s] godhead who will not come with no\n[779.1s] modified energy but in the fullness of\n[781.8s] divine\n[785.7s] power. Are you together brethren? Some\n[789.0s] are sleeping. Is this thing\n[791.9s] projected? I'm not seeing the projector\n[795.1s] now. Listen,\n[797.0s] brethren, sin could be\n[802.7s] resisted.\n[804.2s] Listen, sin could be resisted and\n[806.7s] overcome\n[809.1s] only. Now the quotition\n[812.3s] says, it means this is the only way that\n[816.0s] strain could be done. What?\n[820.6s] resisted through the mighty agency of\n[823.9s] the third person of the godhead. But now\n[828.1s] from Christ we saw that the\n[830.3s] personalities that\n[832.4s] Christ is only\n[835.4s] himself,\n[837.3s] God, angels and man. But now each word\n[842.4s] says that it again another person called\n[845.0s] the third person of what? The godhead.\n[847.9s] But now we have to ask Christ why in\n[850.1s] your word you are not reh revealing to\n[853.3s] us that indeed there's a third person in\n[856.8s] your sayings you only tell us you know\n[858.6s] three personalities but now listen\n[860.7s] brethren in the book of Zechariah\n[862.5s] chapter 6 verse 13 we need to understand\n[866.5s] why is the bible is the spirit of\n[869.2s] prophecy speaking with the third person\n[870.8s] of the godhead one Christ in his word\n[874.6s] identifies only for personalities\n[878.3s] is Zechariah\n[881.4s] chapter 6 verse 13\n[887.0s] the Bible says even shall be the temple\n[889.8s] of the Lord even he shall be the temple\n[891.8s] of the Lord\n[894.0s] who is that that Christ himself even he\n[897.6s] shall be the temple of what of the Lord\n[900.8s] have you opened your Bibles yes yes\n[903.3s] let's read together even he shall be the\n[905.8s] temple of who? And he shall bear the\n[909.5s] glory and shall sit and rule upon his\n[912.9s] what? And he shall be a priest upon his\n[916.0s] what? Throne. And the council of peace\n[919.9s] shall be between them both. Now the\n[923.8s] council of peace is\n[925.6s] between Christ himself and\n[928.9s] who? The\n[932.4s] father. Is that the third person?\n[936.6s] Is that the third\n[939.3s] person? No. Turn to the book of Genesis.\n[942.2s] We see cuz this is another verse that\n[944.6s] people\n[946.8s] use to prove from the Bible that this\n[949.8s] trinity doctrine. But now let's see in\n[952.5s] Genesis 1 26 the Bible reads, \"And God\n[956.6s] said, let us make man in our own what?\n[960.8s] image after our likeness, and let them\n[963.5s] have dominion over the fish of the sea,\n[965.7s] and over the fall of the air, and over\n[968.4s] the cattle, and over all the earth, and\n[970.6s] over every creeping thing that creepeth\n[972.9s] upon what? The earth. Now God speaks and\n[975.8s] saying, \"Now let us make man in our own\n[979.5s] image, and who is in the image of God.\"\n[982.4s] The book of Colossians chapter 1 verse\n[984.2s] one. These are verses that you know.\n[987.2s] Let's open Colossians 1:16.\n[994.3s] The Bible says who is\n[999.5s] there? Colossians 1 it says verse 15\n[1005.5s] says who is the image of the invisible\n[1009.2s] God\n[1011.9s] of Egypt. Who is that? That Christ\n[1015.4s] himself is in the image of who? of the\n[1018.7s] invisible God. Verse 16 says, \"For by\n[1021.4s] him are all things created.\" So by whom\n[1025.0s] did God create all\n[1027.2s] things? By Christ. Then who is in the\n[1030.5s] image of the invisible\n[1033.5s] God? Has anyone in this congregation\n[1036.2s] ever read where the Bible says that the\n[1038.6s] Holy Spirit who is in the image of the\n[1041.0s] invisible\n[1042.2s] God? Help me brethren. Who has read\n[1045.1s] that? that the Holy Spirit who is a in\n[1048.4s] the image of invisible\n[1050.3s] God is that writing like that in the\n[1053.4s] Bible who has read such a thing in the\n[1055.8s] Bible can help us\n[1058.0s] understand it is\n[1060.2s] not we are very sure that it is only\n[1064.0s] Christ who is in the image of who\n[1068.2s] invisible God now when God says let us\n[1071.4s] create man in our own image who was God\n[1075.9s] speaking to Christ himself. You read the\n[1078.8s] book of Proverbs\n[1080.1s] 8:22 going downward says that Christ was\n[1083.5s] with the father in the cre in the\n[1085.8s] creation. Was there the third person\n[1087.9s] called God the Holy Spirit? No, the\n[1090.9s] Bible don't reveal that it was Christ\n[1093.4s] who was by the side of the father during\n[1095.8s] the creation what the creation work. Now\n[1098.8s] the only person who can enter into\n[1101.1s] council with the father is who is Christ\n[1105.6s] himself. That the council of peace shall\n[1108.4s] be\n[1109.4s] between them both. Now listen brethren\n[1113.5s] turn to\n[1114.7s] PP. Let's check that is not in the\n[1117.2s] projector but we read it. Not everything\n[1120.3s] is written. So God also brings some\n[1122.0s] quotations as we continue so that you\n[1124.1s] understand the book of\n[1130.8s] PP that is part and prophets.\n[1137.9s] Yeah. That is page 34. The sovereign of\n[1140.7s] the universe is page 34. Sure. Now it\n[1143.2s] says the sovereign of the universe. That\n[1145.4s] is 34 paragraph 1. Listen this brethren.\n[1148.8s] The sovereign of the universe was not\n[1151.5s] alone in his work of beneficiaries. He\n[1154.2s] had a associate a coworker who could\n[1158.2s] appreciate his what? His purposes. Now\n[1162.1s] the sovereign of the universe God the\n[1164.4s] father he was not alone in his work of\n[1168.2s] what of creation. Then she says that he\n[1172.5s] had an associate a coworker who could\n[1175.1s] appreciate his work. He had a coworker.\n[1179.0s] Check the\n[1181.2s] grammar. Does the spirit of prophecy\n[1183.5s] says that he had\n[1188.1s] coworkers? He had a co worker with a few\n[1192.5s] English. I know the little English I\n[1193.8s] know. I know that is that is something\n[1195.6s] that is not plural but singular. Sure.\n[1200.4s] Now it says that he had an associate\n[1204.6s] single a coworker who could appreciate\n[1208.2s] his purposes and could share his joy in\n[1211.3s] giving happiness to the created what\n[1214.0s] beings. In the beginning was the\n[1216.9s] word and the word was with God and the\n[1220.6s] word was God. The same was in the\n[1223.3s] beginning with God. Christ. Now listen\n[1226.7s] brother and sister. Christ the word of\n[1229.5s] God the only begotten of God was one\n[1233.8s] with eternal father. One in what?\n[1237.0s] Nature. Nature. One in character in\n[1241.8s] purpose. The only\n[1245.7s] being all the purposes of God.\n[1250.7s] Are we together? that the only being\n[1254.8s] that could enter into the councils and\n[1257.8s] purposes of God was\n[1259.4s] who was Christ. Now, where was this\n[1262.1s] third person of the Godhead? Where are\n[1264.6s] so many of us thought that you see\n[1266.2s] there's the third person of the Godhead?\n[1267.7s] There's another being called the Holy\n[1269.3s] Spirit. Is that\n[1271.9s] true? Is that true? Because the spirit\n[1275.5s] of prophecy says that the only being\n[1278.7s] that will enter into the council and the\n[1281.4s] purpose of God was who was Christ\n[1284.2s] himself. Amen. Now when God is doing his\n[1288.0s] work of beneficial who was with him as a\n[1291.9s] coworker is Christ himself there was not\n[1295.0s] another being. But now we are coming\n[1296.7s] back to the quotation.\n[1298.5s] Why is EG saying that sin could only be\n[1304.4s] resisted by the mighty agency of the\n[1307.8s] third person of the Godhead? What does\n[1311.4s] she mean by saying this? And we're going\n[1313.7s] to look at some more\n[1315.4s] quotations. What was this woman meaning?\n[1317.8s] You have to study this woman rightly and\n[1319.9s] understand how she writes and ammonize\n[1322.6s] all the quotations that she's giving us\n[1325.0s] because I believe could not give us\n[1328.0s] something that is an error. Is that very\n[1329.8s] true? He was led by the spirit of what?\n[1332.9s] The spirit of God. Now it is us to study\n[1336.6s] what did she mean? Many of us run to\n[1339.8s] these quotations and say now you see the\n[1342.6s] spirit of prophecy of the godhead. Now\n[1345.4s] there are three beings in heaven. But\n[1347.2s] now the Bible says that the only being\n[1349.8s] who could enter into the councils and\n[1352.1s] the purposes of God was who was Christ\n[1355.7s] himself. Turn to great\n[1359.1s] controversy. The book great\n[1363.6s] controversy. Another\n[1366.4s] proof that is being given from the\n[1368.9s] spirit of prophecy that we have only two\n[1373.6s] beings who came into one council to\n[1377.0s] bring the council of peace into the\n[1379.5s] earth. Now listen 493 paragraph 1. It\n[1382.2s] says before the entrance of evil there\n[1385.8s] was peace and joy throughout the\n[1387.4s] universe.\n[1388.4s] Amen. All was in perfect harmony with\n[1391.2s] the creator's will. Love for God was\n[1393.4s] supreme. Love on one\n[1396.1s] another impartial. That is 493 brethren\n[1399.9s] and sisters. 493 paragraph\n[1402.4s] 1. Great controversy. It says before the\n[1407.0s] entrance of evil there was peace and\n[1409.0s] what joy throughout the universe always\n[1412.1s] in perfect harmony with the creator's\n[1413.9s] will. Love for God was supreme. Love for\n[1417.5s] one another in passion. Christ the word,\n[1421.0s] the only begotten of God was one with\n[1424.4s] whom? Eternal father, one in nature, in\n[1428.8s] character, in purpose, the only being in\n[1432.7s] all the universe who could enter into\n[1435.2s] the\n[1436.6s] council into all the\n[1439.6s] councils and purposes of God. Now listen\n[1443.5s] brethren the only being in all the\n[1450.2s] universe now is the only being who could\n[1452.9s] enter into the council and purposes of\n[1455.2s] God is Christ\n[1458.1s] himself. Amen. Now come back to your\n[1461.2s] Bible because you have realized that the\n[1463.5s] only\n[1464.8s] being who could enter into the council\n[1467.8s] and purposes of Jehovah is Christ is\n[1470.7s] what?\n[1472.4s] So is there a person called God the Holy\n[1475.0s] Spirit who engage in the work of\n[1477.5s] creation? No. There were only\n[1481.3s] two who did the work of creation. Now\n[1484.9s] come back to your Bible. Now let us turn\n[1487.1s] to the book of second Peter. You want to\n[1491.8s] see yesterday we got that in the Bible\n[1494.5s] precept the Holy Spirit can speak.\n[1498.4s] Sure. That was the book of Acts 13:2.\n[1501.8s] And the Holy Ghost said, we want to look\n[1503.6s] how is this possible? How does a thing\n[1506.2s] that doesn't have form\n[1509.5s] speaks? How is something that is a being\n[1514.0s] speaks? We are to be sure from the word\n[1516.8s] of God. Now, let's turn to the book of\n[1519.4s] second Peter chapter 1\n[1521.5s] 19. We see in many aspects of the Bible,\n[1527.8s] it says,\n[1529.4s] Yeah, we have also a word of prophecy\n[1532.5s] that we have also a word of prophecy\n[1534.9s] where\n[1538.6s] you look\n[1542.8s] Uhhuh. life in that place. Uhhuh.\n[1548.8s] Uhhuh.\n[1550.8s] In your heart. Sure. Knowing this fact,\n[1553.4s] now knowing this fact that no prophecy\n[1556.2s] of the scripture is any private\n[1558.2s] interpretation. That no prophecy of the\n[1560.6s] scriptures is of any private inition.\n[1565.0s] Read verse 21. The prophecy came not in\n[1569.0s] the will. That prophecy came not in all\n[1572.3s] time by the will of man.\n[1576.0s] But holy men of God,\n[1579.7s] that holy men of God,\n[1584.6s] I want you to understand how the Bible\n[1585.9s] is written. Now Peter says that the holy\n[1589.2s] men of God spake as they were moved\n[1593.6s] by the Holy Ghost. It mean everything\n[1598.6s] they spake was\n[1603.2s] from\n[1604.8s] God. They were filled with the Holy\n[1607.4s] Spirit and then they spoke the words of\n[1609.9s] who? The words of God. It may be\n[1612.3s] possible when I\n[1614.0s] say okay let me not first bring that\n[1616.3s] principle but now turn to again the book\n[1617.8s] of John chapter 14. I want to bring that\n[1620.6s] principle later. The book of John\n[1622.6s] chapter\n[1625.6s] 14. No, let's first check John 15 first.\n[1629.5s] Check this principles of the Bible. John\n[1633.0s] 15:26.\n[1635.8s] Bible says the comforter is now listen.\n[1639.8s] But now when the comforter is come and\n[1642.1s] who is the comforter?\n[1644.2s] Who is the\n[1647.4s] comforter? Who is the\n[1650.8s] comforter? Someone saying Christ. I'm\n[1653.1s] the Holy Spirit. Yeah, we'll see that.\n[1656.1s] That always very true. Now read brother.\n[1661.0s] But now when the comforter is\n[1663.6s] come from the father whom the father is\n[1666.5s] going to send from the father\n[1669.7s] even the spirit even the spirit of truth\n[1673.5s] proceedth from the father. Then this\n[1675.5s] spirit proceedth from who?\n[1678.9s] It shall testify of me. This spirit\n[1681.8s] shall testify of of me. Now listen\n[1685.9s] brethren that when that comforter come\n[1688.4s] even the spirit of truth he shall\n[1692.1s] testify of me he shall\n[1694.8s] personality can I say that a lawyer it\n[1698.2s] come in the\n[1701.5s] house grammatical in in any\n[1704.8s] sense that brother it went it went and\n[1709.3s] it came it is very impossible but now\n[1713.1s] the bible say that when that water come,\n[1716.6s] whomever will send unto you from the\n[1719.0s] father, even the spirit of truth which\n[1721.4s] proceedth from the father, he shall\n[1725.3s] testify of me. Why in the Bible have you\n[1729.0s] ever read the spirit testifying of\n[1735.6s] Christ? What am I doing here?\n[1740.0s] What am I doing here?\n[1742.9s] But what is Christ\n[1744.4s] says that when that spirit comes, he\n[1747.0s] shall testify of what? Who has ever seen\n[1749.5s] the Holy Spirit\n[1751.4s] testifying? Who has ever seen? I read\n[1754.1s] somewhere that that spirit came and it\n[1756.7s] was testifying and people were moved by\n[1759.0s] the word of who has ever read such a\n[1760.9s] thing. Now listen, brethren, let us see.\n[1763.5s] There are those who testify of\n[1767.3s] Jesus. Number one principle, turn to the\n[1769.8s] book of Revelation.\n[1772.0s] and take that to be your mind that when\n[1774.2s] the spirit of truth come even the\n[1776.5s] comforter he shall\n[1779.0s] testify of me when the Bible have you\n[1782.6s] ever read the spirit\n[1785.2s] testify of the Christ himself\n[1807.4s] No. 22:16 the book of Revelation. Jesus\n[1811.5s] sent my angel. Jesus have sent my\n[1815.6s] angel to\n[1818.0s] testify unto\n[1820.8s] you these things in the midst of\n[1823.1s] churches.\n[1827.7s] Amen. Now who is testifying here? But\n[1832.1s] what did Christ say that? Who did Christ\n[1834.8s] say that will testify of\n[1838.1s] him? But now Revelation says that it is\n[1841.6s] the angel. This is Christ still speaking\n[1845.6s] himself that he has seen his angel to\n[1849.0s] testify and what these things. But the\n[1852.4s] same speaks in John chapter 15 that the\n[1855.4s] spirit of truth even the converter shall\n[1858.1s] testify of me who is testifying.\n[1863.4s] Now listen brethren turn the book of\n[1866.4s] acts 1\n[1868.3s] vers8 you have to understand what Christ\n[1870.8s] was meaning 18 acts 1 vers8\n[1874.9s] now listen Christ said but he disciples\n[1877.4s] shall receive\n[1878.9s] power and\n[1882.1s] after the holy ghost is come upon\n[1886.4s] you he shall be\n[1888.7s] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem\n[1893.3s] and all Judea in\n[1896.7s] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of\n[1899.7s] what? Now Christ says, \"But he shall\n[1902.5s] receive power after that the Holy Ghost\n[1905.0s] is come upon what? Then he shall do that\n[1908.2s] that what? Witness or testify of me only\n[1912.2s] after the Holy Spirit comes unto you.\"\n[1915.1s] It is very true when I say that the Holy\n[1917.0s] Spirit was testifying of Christ in the\n[1919.1s] days of the\n[1921.2s] apostles. Is that very true? Yes. But\n[1925.3s] now he's testifying of the apost of\n[1927.8s] Christ himself through the apostles.\n[1931.0s] Why? Because\n[1934.1s] preaches can testify but it can only\n[1938.1s] witness and testify inside a\n[1941.1s] believer or an angel.\n[1945.4s] Are we\n[1947.0s] together? Now listen, stand to this\n[1950.1s] book. I'm coming back to the Bible. I'm\n[1952.6s] not running from the\n[1954.0s] Bible. That's the same quotation in 29\n[1957.4s] page 34. This is true quotation. Those\n[1960.3s] who have here sometimes saying these\n[1962.0s] things were added. This is manuscript\n[1964.6s] volume 2 page 34 paragraph 1. that evil\n[1968.0s] had been accumulating for centuries and\n[1970.2s] could only be restrained and assisted by\n[1972.0s] the mighty power of what? The Holy\n[1974.2s] Spirit. The third person of what? The\n[1977.2s] who could come with no modified energy.\n[1980.1s] Listen, there's this spirit does not\n[1983.1s] come with its own modified energy, but\n[1986.2s] in the fullness of what? Divine power.\n[1988.8s] Another spirit must be met for the\n[1991.1s] essence of evil was working in all ways\n[1993.4s] and the submission of man to his what?\n[1995.5s] Satanic captivity was amazing. The same\n[1998.5s] in 1888 materials page 49 1493 paragraph\n[2003.2s] 2 says evil had been accumulating for\n[2005.8s] centuries and could only be restrained\n[2009.1s] and resisted now in each and every\n[2012.1s] quotations using white\n[2014.6s] ads some vocabulary and English. He she\n[2018.0s] says he evil had been accumulating for\n[2020.4s] centuries and could only be restrained\n[2023.1s] and resisted by the mighty power of\n[2025.7s] what? The Holy Spirit, the third person,\n[2029.6s] the Godhead who could come with no\n[2031.5s] modified energy but in the fullness of\n[2033.7s] divine power. The mighty agency in CTR\n[2036.5s] Christ triumphant page 301 paragraph\n[2040.6s] number one. How many witnesses are those\n[2043.5s] in the quotations? Now can you say this\n[2046.0s] quotation was\n[2048.5s] added? No. It is there the Bible and it\n[2051.7s] came from the lips of each. It says\n[2056.4s] Christ determined to bestow a gift of\n[2059.0s] those who had been with him and who\n[2062.1s] should believe on him because this was\n[2064.9s] the equation of his ascension and\n[2066.9s] inaugression and to believe in heaven.\n[2069.6s] What gift could Christ bestow rich\n[2072.1s] enough to signalize and grace his\n[2075.2s] ascension to the medial throne? It must\n[2078.6s] be worthy of his greatness and his\n[2080.8s] royality. Christ gave his representative\n[2083.7s] the third person of the godhead, the\n[2086.1s] holy\n[2087.2s] what? Spirit. And this gift could not be\n[2090.2s] done\n[2091.0s] what? This thing is a gift. It is a\n[2094.8s] gift. Take that. And how do God bestow\n[2097.7s] gift unto his people? Through which\n[2101.2s] process? Through which process? How do\n[2104.3s] we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit?\n[2106.2s] Do they come direct from the father?\n[2108.8s] What is the order? It comes from the\n[2112.1s] father, the\n[2114.0s] son. Then the ministation of what? All\n[2117.4s] the angels. It is a gift. The Holy\n[2119.4s] Spirit is a gift that is given unto us.\n[2122.4s] Turn back to your Bible, brethren. There\n[2124.5s] is the third person of the godhead. Last\n[2126.3s] time the book of John chapter 14 and\n[2130.5s] veil we are coming back still. This is\n[2133.8s] something that is very easy to explain\n[2136.4s] in the Bible. Now the book of John\n[2138.7s] chapter 14. Let us\n[2141.7s] take verse number 15 says, \"If you love\n[2145.6s] me, keep my commandments and I will pray\n[2149.0s] the father and he shall give you another\n[2151.8s] what that he\n[2155.3s] personality he may abide with\n[2158.7s] you forever. Even the spirit of truth\n[2162.2s] whom the world cannot receive because it\n[2164.6s] seeth him what? Never knoweth him not\n[2167.8s] but he know him.\"\n[2173.1s] How to listen bre what Christ says and I\n[2177.4s] will pray the father and he shall give\n[2179.3s] you another comforter that is the holy\n[2181.4s] spirit sure that we may abide with you\n[2184.8s] forever forever even the spirit of truth\n[2188.3s] now listen brethren turn to the book of\n[2189.9s] matthew we are coming back\n[2192.4s] there is precept upon precept 28 verse\n[2196.2s] 19 that you\n[2198.7s] The Bible reads\n[2201.5s] 28 verse 19, the book of Matthew.\n[2204.4s] Go therefore, teach all nations.\n[2208.9s] Uh-huh. Know the Son, not the Holy\n[2211.9s] Ghost.\n[2213.8s] Yeah.\n[2215.4s] Yeah.\n[2218.5s] Always even unto the end of the world.\n[2220.8s] Now Christ says long I Christ I am with\n[2225.2s] you always even unto the end. Now who\n[2229.8s] was supposed to remain the disciples\n[2231.3s] until the end of the world? Is Christ\n[2233.4s] himself in the book of Matthew? Are we\n[2235.5s] together? But now listen in 14:16 he\n[2238.5s] says even the spirit of truth whom the\n[2241.6s] world cannot do what? receive because it\n[2244.1s] seeth him not neither knoweth him not\n[2246.2s] but he know him for he dwelleth with you\n[2249.1s] and shall be in\n[2252.6s] you I don't know much English not\n[2255.7s] learned such as you\n[2257.7s] people not learned but I understand what\n[2260.6s] the Christ is saying now Christ says\n[2263.3s] that this comforter will abide with them\n[2266.1s] forever then Matthew 28 19 and 20 Christ\n[2269.8s] says that me Christ I shall be with you\n[2273.4s] even\n[2274.9s] unto the end of the world. Christ\n[2278.2s] himself speaking. But now Christ speaks\n[2280.8s] of the spirit and saying that this\n[2283.0s] spirit will b with you forever even unto\n[2286.8s] the end of what? The world. Then verse\n[2289.6s] 17, Christ says that even the spirit of\n[2291.4s] truth whom the world cannot receive\n[2294.0s] because it seeth him not yet never\n[2296.5s] knoweth him but he know him for he\n[2298.9s] dwelleth with you\n[2301.0s] now.\n[2302.6s] Sure. For he does what? Dwelleth with\n[2306.2s] you. Now as he speaks, that spirit\n[2309.0s] dwells with what? With you. But again he\n[2312.5s] says and shall be in you. That is what?\n[2316.5s] In the\n[2317.7s] future. Now that dwells with them as he\n[2321.5s] speaks with them. But now he says but\n[2324.7s] later he will be in\n[2329.4s] you. Do we understand?\n[2332.6s] Do you\n[2333.8s] understand? Oh, listen brethren. Turn\n[2335.8s] down to your phones. Open the\n[2337.6s] quotations. We are harmonizing the\n[2339.8s] scriptures in the spirit of prophecy cuz\n[2342.2s] my time is\n[2343.6s] up. Oh brother. Okay, let me read the\n[2346.3s] last\n[2352.8s] quotation. Now I want to read a book\n[2355.0s] that most of you I don't know if you\n[2356.6s] have it in your\n[2357.8s] phones. Now we are so used to the red\n[2365.2s] estate. Now I want to read from letters\n[2367.4s] and\n[2373.8s] manuscript. Letters and manuscript.\n[2376.6s] Allow me look for it\n[2378.4s] brother.

I want to be\n[2419.0s] okay. It says 19 LTMS letter 66 of 1894\n[2422.9s] paragraph 18\n[2426.7s] paragraph 18. Now it says let me read\n[2429.3s] mine. If any of you lack wisdom, let him\n[2433.0s] ask of God that giveth all men li\n[2436.3s] liberally and apprenth not. And it shall\n[2439.8s] be given him, but let him act in what?\n[2442.5s] In faith, nothing wavering. James 1:5\n[2445.1s] and 6. And whatsoever we ask, we receive\n[2448.0s] of him because we keep his commandments\n[2450.7s] and do those things that are pleasing in\n[2453.0s] his sight. And we know that the son of\n[2455.8s] God is come, that is Christ himself, the\n[2458.0s] son of God, and hath given us an\n[2460.6s] understanding that we may know him that\n[2463.1s] is true and we are in him that is true\n[2467.6s] even in his son Jesus Christ. This is\n[2470.5s] the true God and eternal life. Little\n[2474.0s] children, keep yourself from\n[2476.6s] others. Then the Bible says in 1 John 5\n[2480.2s] 21, the Lord is soon to come. We want\n[2484.2s] that complete and perfect understanding\n[2487.1s] which the letter alone can give. Now\n[2489.4s] listen brothers and sisters, it is not\n[2491.8s] safe to catch the spirit from another.\n[2495.3s] It is not safe to do what? To catch the\n[2498.6s] spirit from another. We want the Holy\n[2501.8s] Spirit which\n[2504.0s] is Jesus\n[2507.1s] Christ. Are we\n[2509.3s] together? that we want the Holy Spirit\n[2512.2s] to reach. Listen to the grammar that\n[2514.3s] this woman\n[2515.7s] had. I'm praying. We want the Holy\n[2518.9s] Spirit to which is Jesus Christ. If you\n[2521.6s] commune with God, we shall have strength\n[2523.8s] and grace and efficiency. Amen. Now, who\n[2527.5s] is the Holy\n[2529.0s] Spirit? I'll continue from there as we\n[2532.2s] be looking. What did EG White mean by\n[2535.4s] saying that seal could only be\n[2538.4s] resisted only through the mighty agency\n[2541.0s] of the third person of what? But now the\n[2543.9s] spirit of truth that Christ is promising\n[2545.8s] to his disciples is he himself\n[2549.8s] manifested in what? In the person of his\n[2554.3s] spirit. Amen. Are we together? How many\n[2558.5s] are following this? Allow me see. know\n[2560.7s] you can be teaching a big class and how\n[2563.6s] many just carry up and be be very I'm\n[2566.6s] seeing brethren how many are saying man\n[2569.0s] not understanding\n[2570.4s] this I'm still\n[2572.9s] confused sure sister you'll speak and\n[2576.6s] I'll give chance for questions now let\n[2579.0s] us pray then I believe tomorrow God will\n[2581.4s] give us another chance to continue in\n[2582.7s] Jesus\n[2591.9s] We are\n[2594.3s] praying. Our father in heaven, we thank\n[2596.6s] you for this\n[2598.2s] day. Thank you for giving me strength to\n[2600.6s] speak unto thy children. Indeed, I'm\n[2602.6s] unworthy to stand before such a\n[2604.2s] congregation because of our\n[2606.1s] sinfulness. But father because of thy\n[2608.4s] graces you still allow us to preach\n[2610.1s] these mighty truths and holy truths. We\n[2613.2s] pray that each and every time we study\n[2614.9s] this truth help us father that even\n[2616.6s] ourselves you'll be sanctified through\n[2618.3s] the truth. That father one day as you\n[2621.0s] come in the glory of thy angels, the\n[2622.7s] glory of thy father and the glory that\n[2624.5s] you have. We might stand firm to say\n[2627.4s] this is our God that you have been\n[2628.7s] waiting for. I pray for the brethren\n[2631.4s] listening unto these messages. Indeed,\n[2633.3s] this is a powerful convention which\n[2634.9s] youths are deciding to walk in the\n[2637.8s] truth. How I pray that you help both of\n[2640.3s] us to stand firm upon the platform of\n[2643.3s] eternal truth as we'll be continuing\n[2646.1s] this study. Father, I pray that you help\n[2647.6s] us understand who you are right because\n[2650.3s] we know that the\n[2651.7s] only topic that will help us overcome\n[2655.0s] sin and live a purity of life is to know\n[2656.7s] they are right. I pray for those who are\n[2659.8s] in this all women, children, youths, men\n[2663.9s] that father give us strength to know\n[2665.5s] their right. Help us to study our Bibles\n[2668.1s] and help us to be of humble spirit to be\n[2670.3s] taught by thee that you know who you\n[2672.8s] are. The programs that remain in this\n[2675.8s] day, the teachings we have, Father, we\n[2678.2s] pray that you help us to take them\n[2679.5s] seriously. That father we might say that\n[2682.5s] at the end of this convention that\n[2684.0s] indeed it was very powerful and God was\n[2686.6s] with us through his ministration of all\n[2688.0s] the angels above with us. Father help us\n[2691.1s] to understand more and more in thy\n[2692.9s] scriptures and above. Father we pray\n[2695.4s] that we daily help us to claim upon thy\n[2698.0s] promises and trust in the righteousness\n[2700.7s] of thy son that we live a holy life is\n[2703.2s] our prayer by faith in Jesus holy name.\n[2706.0s] Amen."

        "full_transcript": "obedience to God at the end of the presentation we realized that there's another kind of education that aim is to seek first the kingdom of God and all shall be added unto us then the Lord the Lord was calling us to join the second the second system of Education that a being Obed to God and seeking fast his kingdom and righteousness today I want us to look something on Christ because our gospel in centered upon the ministry of Christ yesterday during the class of gospel order we were taught that we need to preach or present things in according to the order of Christ and therefore Christ is the standard of everything and therefore gospel should uplift Christ [Music] today in the class of true education I want us to check something on Christ because the book of isah 53 shows me how Christ was sacrificed as a [Music] lamb and Christ gave himself to come and die for you and me and the bigger thing that we are striving for is that to have the character of Christ because God only accept the righteousness of Christ because Christ was in a perfect demand of the law so if that righteousness of Christ can be imputed into us then God is going to accept us now I want us to look upon Christ the book of second Peter second Peter chapter 22 chapter 2 let me check if it is first Peter there's something I want it is first Peter 2: 21 allow me begin with vers 20 if you are together with me in the book of First Peter please say amen amen verse 20 says for what glory is it for what glory is it if if when he be buffed buff buffed for your faults he shall take it patiently but if when he do well and suffer for it he take it patiently this is acceptable and with God verse 21 says for even here unto we are he called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that he should follow his steps amen [Music] amen God is good my point is in verse 21 that Christ also suffered for us now leaving as an example that follow his step now for us to be Christians for us to be those who are going to heaven we have to follow the steps of by the way the characteristics of the we are told they do what about the lamp amen they follow the lamp Wherever by the way you go to the Book of Revelation chapter 15 you realized that those who overcome the beast at his image the Bible says that the name of the father and the lamp was upon their forehead and we also realize that the name can also be used to show character and therefore they are going to have the character of Christ now Christ left us an example for us to follow I'm in the class of verse 22 says who did no sin neither was found in his [Music] mouth amen so we need to be like Christ we need to have the humility of Christ we need to have that kindness of Christ and by that if we bring Christ into our gospel then Min are going to be converted now I want us to take an example that Christ left step that he left for us follow me to the Book of Luke Luke 2 I want to touch two things in this Lon and if I'll be finished with these two things even if time will not be over I will give you chance to to comment and ask questions in this class but go with me to the Book of Luke L and the verse is uh 50 I'm reading and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and they went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these things in the heart look at verse [Music] 52 the Bible tells me and Jesus increased in wisdom and State and in favor with God and man God is good that Jesus incre in was in what wisdom amen amen and we realize that there are two systems of two types of wisdom we have the wisdom of the Greeks and the wisdom of God and we realize from The Book of Job chter 28 that no man knowe the price of wisdom and verse 2 of told us that the fear of the Lord is is wisdom and departing from Evil is is understanding and therefore when Jesus increased in wisdom Christ was in a perfect system that God designed you go to the book says happy that widom and the testimony continues by saying that the system that God began in theard of is clearly evident that wisdom is obtained through ucation so Christ for him to be increased in knowledge and wisdom Christ and therefore we are told that we are to follow the steps of Christ are to acquire the same education that Christ acquired I pray that God may help us to walk according to the steps of Christ because it is the steps of Christ that will lead us to God I don't want to waste a lot of time because today I want you to ask questions and comment I want us to to the book desire I want us to look on how Christ acquired education then we connect to the book first 2 ver 21 that if Christ left for us example that if we are to be follow the lamp wherever he go then ucation system will be should be that of Christ because whatever was perfect in Christ should be made perfect in us because the book of 15 my Bible tells me something the Bible says that for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with our which which cannot be touched with the feelings of in infirmities but was in all points tempted like we are yet without sin hallelujah hallelujah that Christ was temped even as we are done that is touch [Music] that Christ became man for us for him to understand what man should under and therefore whatever he under we are to go through that the book this is p let me check the page I'm reading from page six uh page 16 paragraph the testimony says wonderful in its [Music] significance in the brief record of his life the [Music] child and and works strong in spirit filled with wisdom that Christ was with what how manying to be like Christ we are to be filled with the wisdom of and therefore we are to walk as Christ listen to this and the grace of God was upon him in the sunlight of his father's countenance Jesus increased in wisdom and and in favor with God and man his mind was active and [Music] penetrating with a thoughtfulness and wisdom Beyond his ears yet his character was beautiful in symmetry the power of Mind and Body developed gradually in keeping with the laws of childhood I hope you are listening to The Life of Christ let me to this paragraph This is now 69 paragraph 29 it says from the earliest uh times the faithful in Israel had given much care to one of the things that very and is the education of the what the ucation of the what we need to see as most by the Lord directed that even from babyhood the children be taught his goodness and greatness especially red in as shown in the history of isra song and prayer lessons from scriptures were to be aded the opening mind hallelujah amen what what what was to be adapted as the opening mind of baby a baby child it is what and what song and prayer song and pray prayer prayer and lessons from the what the scures me what is made the opening the mind of the children today is it in prayer and L from the scriptures [Music] you are cutting up your he is confused in the mind so that when you read ver9 [Music] understand that but this is what this is what God designed and I think what God designed is the best for the children of and are to go to must go back to what God des and therefore today much we had G asay that our minds were not opened up by song prayer and listen from scripture the Lord has prepared to bring us back again so that if we listen to his voice come back to his perfect will then we are going to Beed of Heaven let me Contin fathers and mothers were instructed were to instruct their children that the Lord of God is an expression of his character in in the je economy who was to instruct the children who fathers and who mothers and therefore we realize that there age that a child should spend with parents that that is during the Hebrew economy before taken to the school of prophets children do not even take time with their parents that is why today it is very tough to do devotion with young young men like us and even as we try to be in devotions you realize that we are not so serious with it because we are not growing with it we are just trying because we have read and we we are trying that God may help us be of that character if we would be educated in this way then we will be in a perfect by the way we would be good but today we have problems in the Church of God because we were we were not taught in this life but there hope because God is calling us to back back to this program is prepared to receive us it continues by saying and that as they receive the prin OFW into the [Music] mind because we are told the system that designed was to bring back the image of God upon his children I don't know what kind of system education today that kind of system education we have today can it help to bring back theage of God take for example you are studying that Evolution the can you connect can that bring back the image of God see come back to the [Music] going to continue we are going to continue uh in the system of Education that we not bring back the image of God then there might not be Redemption for us because the book of Education says right you will use you will use Asing somewhere it says in the highest sense education and Redemption is one one maybe something like that because so is it in Redemption so we canot I someone can compare [Music] now question if we go in the system of wrong education are we going to be redeemed are we going to be redeemed come back to the principles friends listen to The Life of Christ in the days of Christ City that not provide for the religious instruction to the young wased C of God by the way this church if we don't train our children the right principles are we are told that the one thing that is seen as necessary is by the way by the way we are not teaching people not to go to school if I find somebody not going to school in this class I'll be the one to call the policemen to arrest him because we are the big supporters of UC education is redemption Hallelujah education is what and therefore what we need to support so much is the education of the youth and any other person now we need to be educated but which system ofation are you going to be educated in is it education that is going to bring back the image of God and to fulfill the Plan of Redemption or is it that education that will crowd the mind with unnecessary knowledge and lead to [Music] death now as never before we need to do what we [Music] fa may God really help us that we might come to principle and Beed of now listen to this yet the teaching had become foral tradition had inur are you seeing the apostasy that was found within the nation now tradition the scriptures no no now their system became this way children could do devotion for 10 minutes but the other hours is me to learn traditions and theories by the way education by that time when tradition had supped the scriptures they justers but still they do exams on that is when tradition the scriptures I'm in the Life of Christ [Music] I don't know the exactag I am but theth uhuh it continues by saying true education will lead the [Music] youth to seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him but the teachers gave attention to the ceremonies [Music] how many are seeing the system was corrupt that the materials that crowded the mind was worthless to the [Music] land I always use this example someone how many have G School just you have gone under that now are you able to apply IND andms in the Life Today Indi no it was to the Lear the Lear yeah someone is learning now now today you see that the world isg the kind of this that was corrupt ised with unnecessary canot apply m and we pray that God may help us so that we might come back topl let me continue by this we are looking upon the Life of Christ because we realize we need to uplift Christ The Gospel we are and first P 2: 21 told us that Christ suffer living example I'm now bringing you to the Life of Christ continues by saying uh the experience which is obtained through personal acceptance of's and that will not be recognized amen that is what I wanted [Music] let me just get that place I'm looking for it materals was worthless to the learner recognized in the schools of the in the higher that will not be recognized in the high school of not going to be accepted in heaven do you think is going to accept you in heaven if what we have learned is not going to be accepted in [Music] the I don't know how to explain this but USI AC of's [Music] word let me give you an example a young a young lady a young man accept the Sabbath as anding to keep theb should be can that be accepted in the UC system of the world today that is how the system of the look at this they they uh uhuh absorbed in the round of externals [Music] the students found no hours to spend with God they did not hear his voice speaking to the heart in in their search have you looking for they turned away from thece of wisdom who the source of wisdom is the corrup system of the system of the world education in search of knowledge people turn away from God in of knowled someone comes and say never cre some don't know break [Music] we have that is how people from the of and by the way by this time these people turned from the source of widom they still to be Christians one of the things that when you read of the Apostles you realized that in Act CH 6 and chter S and chapter 8 Paul Wasing upon the of he convinced Paul that Christ was not the Son of God during the time ofan the book of this things this thinging says the great Essentials of the service of God were neglected the principles of law [Music] the Train the powers of the youth were were repressed [Music] don't exped so this is what the system did mind the mind of a preacher who is preaching this this message today here in front do you know why you can sleep hallelujah amen nowr our example we are to lift up Christ look listen this the Child Jesus re instruction are we calling our Christians are we following Christ Christ never received education in which schools now compare the system of the world today is it the same with the system that I was going among the Jews are they the same listen to what I come to end of this and from the Scrolls of the prophets he learn during the ministry this man us why do you think thews CHR someone was never never Lear someone from the congregation who was listening to the presentation yes he never went to when you were reading a quotation last class we realized that there education that is ESS and if people go to that the world them but was not the same thing is happening here today they look as Christ as someone someone who is not [Music] but those who are going to school and learning there they ask a question how is this person how know this letter having never learn you you see when you are in the school of Christ people will just be wondering at you when people sees you explaining they will be just looking at you and saying where is this person never saw this person going to school but this person is able to explain the Plan of Redemption this man is able to explain Daniel 7 this man is able to help us understand is Revelation 6 and that is when you are in the school of Christ are going to the education of Christ are going to the most WIS say Amen am because the Bible says Theus increased in knowled and had full understanding but he never went to Theo to is wisdom is from we have to come back to the true principles that God be no way you can simplify the message I don't know how to [Music] simplify I want to then I go to the book of ration then I give you amen since he gained knowled as many as we may [Music] do intimate theur shows how his early years were given to the stud of God [Music] says every child May Asus we try to become acquainted with our heavenly father through his word angs will near our minds will be strengthened our characters will be elevated and refined we shall become like our we shall be like our savior how many are deciding to be like the Savior we are to go kind of of go with me to that book as I as we proceed to the Book of Revelation I'm coming to the end of this lesson first Lon 2 first first I'm sorry 26 it says he in me himself also to walk even as he walked that we need to walk as Christ did what we know it is good to uplift Christ in the gospel it is good to talk of the humility of Christ amen it is good to talk about the self sacrificing of Christ in the gospel it is good to talk of Christ kindness but are we talking about the ucation of Christ because it is true we need to like we are to be like look the of that is true my friends I don't reject that but do we the people are to LIF Christ but the education of Christ is TR is is stepped down friends if we are to accomplish this GOP we to be like we have I want to see something in the book of we will be making calls after this lessons 18 ver4 [Music] I had many to share I desire that you I only stop from this point now the Book of Revelation 18: with us what what does the Bible say someone to read from the [Music] conation what does it say and I heard another voice from Heaven uhuh saying saying come out of her come out of her people my people that you may that he may be not partakers of her sins and that he receive not of her place amen so there a call to do what come called to do what come out of what now I want I want us to get this because as we are preaching Bon we go to Revelation 17 and we see a woman and we know how to explain how the woman is Catholic and we know how the and we can all see the daughters as the Fallen churches to list11 38 just write that quation you will help someone let me repeat because I see it is p 081 pH 081 p 3 it says it says command found in Revelation 184 come out of my people means to come out of those in institutions which will place in the minds of our young people principles which are up to make them join the class of worshipers of which we read in second Timothy 3: having a form ofl but deny the power there as faithful Watchmen we should be just as desires of getting our children out of the popular School as we are called to the to the older people out of the popular are only a a product of the command in Revelation 18 18 [Music] ver4 we are calling old men from the Fallen churches it is the same way we need to call from the institions [Music] now if we caller Moses from popular churches then we leave Le in popular institions why it continues to read the the popular churches are only a product of world education so to get at the root of the matter we must separate ourself from from that which creates the [Music] condition in which all the religious world at present finds itself hallelujah amen how many understands that [Music] so if we have to get to the root of that problem for us to destroy the popular churches the populars must also be dest as an example now the same way should be called out from a popular school because if you don't call them then this church is going to be still it is because say [Music] school chular so this person is still going for popular our children still in popular if this old man dies which generation will remain the church the generation that was in popular and when they are from the popular Church education they will make the church to be a [Music] popular so if you don't understand the TR you can just go back thank you if we don't understand the [Music] S we are going to be and going to be called out to come out of this system friends this gospel cannot be simplified this gospel is not preached because we are happy of preaching this gospel is not preached because we see that we we need to preach we yester I was impressed of something that not even explain of action to his friends because they want to explain to theirs people want to explain it to their mothers people want to explain them it to their wives people want to explain this gospel to their brothers time is [Music] know come to theel of we see that the we see that we [Music] needing we to the call that at the end of this Lon we decide to be pray [Music] [Music] are to receive thisel that aref for Christ prepared toed be prepared to sleep in CS be prepared to be moed but if you cannot accept be mocked and Separation by friends there no are going to go with thisel really help us to make decision in Jesus uh yes brother briefly like take for example a teacher who teaching class just answer that briefly just answer that someone from who is in the class who can answer that you want to answerone in fact me I'm a teacher by profession issu is making to have sleep nights because I'm there people she's encouraging them in that imagine in school haveed this message because when this this knowled is devish according to James some I think we are all to come okay there's this thing that having the jewi whatever it is called whatever they down and how to run the schools that that curriculum and then they down is not that Learners to go there to learn but everyone to get so there's a point that they that the teachers are there so I am one of people [Music] time is I don't know what to do seconds by the [Music] way problem the problem why the is not gr yeah that is true [Music] I'm coming to you you see yes amen I love that I don't want to comment on that yes just as then f as we pray [Music] then 11 [Music] uh as we continue with that system yes brother Fel in one minute [Music] like [Music] and around to what do you say think butage so what I just to say all those things that you said but so what I wanted to emphasize that the first thing that we should do is to call people out of the popular schools [Music] the popular churches is that what they go but the first one is call them in fact you can better better better better you don't call them out of popular churches because that that is the product of what is in the popular school they go hand in hand now look the way we are today look the way we are today I'm a teacher the wife of is teer we are having students here people are out of the popular churches what are we making perfecton will be the last but talking you need sometimes to comment we also see is up coming you see heal teacher is coming [Music] yes livelihood [Music] [Music] God is good who teaches more than Christ who teaches more I was there and I was there by the way the Lord has called us and God is going to take care of his works sometimes we can use some something to H you see you see but that is not the thing you see you just want to be there you see so the Lord has called us and is going to take care of his work in Jesus name am let's as we pray because my time is up for for amen you can sing 1",

us to check something\n[98.2s] on\n[100.0s] Christ because the book of isah\n[105.1s] 53 shows me how Christ was sacrificed as\n[109.0s] a\n[111.2s] [Music]\n[112.5s] lamb and Christ gave\n[115.6s] himself to come and die for you and me\n[120.7s] and the bigger thing that we are\n[122.2s] striving\n[124.1s] for is that to have the character of\n[127.9s] Christ because God only accept the\n[131.0s] righteousness of\n[134.3s] Christ because Christ was in a perfect\n[137.2s] demand of the\n[140.2s] law so if that righteousness of Christ\n[143.0s] can be imputed into\n[146.2s] us then God is going to accept us\n[151.6s] now I want us to look upon\n[153.7s] Christ the book of second\n[156.9s] Peter second Peter chapter\n[160.9s] 22 chapter\n[166.6s] 2 let me check if it is first Peter\n[169.1s] there's something I\n[173.4s] want it is first Peter 2:\n[178.1s] 21 allow me begin with vers\n[181.2s] 20 if you are together with me in the\n[183.4s] book of First Peter please say\n[188.5s] amen amen verse 20\n[192.4s] says for what glory is\n[195.9s] it for what glory is it if if when he be\n[201.9s] buffed buff buffed for your faults he\n[205.6s] shall take it patiently but if when he\n[208.6s] do well and suffer for it he take it\n[211.6s] patiently this is acceptable and with\n[214.0s] God verse 21 says for even here unto we\n[219.1s] are he called because Christ also\n[221.7s] suffered for us leaving us an example\n[225.4s] that he should follow his steps amen\n[236.1s] [Music]\n[249.9s] amen God is good my point is in verse\n[254.7s] 21 that Christ also suffered for\n[258.5s] us now leaving as an\n[261.9s] example that follow his\n[265.3s] step now for us to be\n[268.0s] Christians for us to be those who are\n[270.2s] going to\n[271.5s] heaven we have to follow the steps\n[274.8s] of by the way the characteristics of\n[283.8s] the we are told they do what about the\n[289.4s] lamp amen they follow the lamp\n[294.2s] Wherever by the way you go to the Book\n[296.5s] of Revelation chapter 15\n[300.6s] you realized that those who overcome the\n[302.4s] beast at his\n[305.9s] image the Bible says that the name of\n[309.6s] the father and the lamp was upon their\n[314.7s] forehead and we also\n[317.2s] realize that the name can also be used\n[319.8s] to show\n[323.0s] character and therefore they are going\n[324.9s] to have the character of\n[326.8s] Christ now Christ left us an example\n[331.2s] for us to follow I'm in the class\n[335.8s] of verse 22\n[338.1s] says who did no\n[340.4s] sin neither was found in his\n[344.3s] [Music]\n[348.2s] mouth amen so we need to be like\n[351.6s] Christ we need to have the humility of\n[355.1s] Christ we need to have that kindness of\n[357.8s] Christ\n[360.8s] and by\n[361.9s] that if we bring Christ into our\n[366.0s] gospel then Min are going to be\n[370.1s] converted now I want us to take an\n[372.2s] example that Christ\n[376.3s] left step that he left for\n[379.0s] us\n[382.6s] follow me to the Book of\n[385.9s] Luke Luke\n[388.1s] 2 I want to touch two things in this\n[392.9s] Lon and if I'll be finished with these\n[395.1s] two\n[396.2s] things even if time will not be\n[399.8s] over I will give you chance to to\n[402.2s] comment and ask questions in this\n[406.7s] class but go with me to the Book of\n[410.0s] Luke\n[412.7s] L and the verse is uh\n[418.0s] 50 I'm reading\n[420.7s] and they understood not the saying which\n[423.1s] he spake unto\n[426.4s] them and they went down with\n[429.7s] them and came to\n[431.9s] Nazareth and was subject unto them but\n[435.9s] his mother kept all these things in the\n[440.0s] heart look at verse\n[442.2s] [Music]\n[443.4s] 52 the Bible tells me and Jesus\n[447.3s] increased in wisdom and State\n[454.2s] and in favor with God and\n[457.5s] man God is good that Jesus incre in was\n[462.2s] in\n[465.2s] what wisdom amen amen and we realize\n[468.6s] that there are two systems of two types\n[470.2s] of\n[472.7s] wisdom we have the wisdom of the\n[476.2s] Greeks and the wisdom of God\n[479.6s] and we realize from The Book of Job\n[481.2s] chter\n[483.2s] 28 that no man knowe the price of\n[487.1s] wisdom and verse 2 of told\n[492.4s] us that the fear of the\n[495.8s] Lord is is\n[498.8s] wisdom and departing from\n[502.6s] Evil is is understanding and therefore\n[506.7s] when Jesus increased in wisdom\n[510.7s] Christ was in a perfect system that God\n[516.2s] designed you go to the\n[524.6s] book says happy that\n[530.0s] widom and the testimony continues by\n[534.2s] saying that the system that God began in\n[537.7s] theard of\n[542.3s] is clearly\n[544.1s] evident that wisdom is obtained through\n[549.2s] ucation so\n[553.8s] Christ for him to be increased in\n[556.2s] knowledge and\n[559.1s] wisdom\n[563.0s] Christ and therefore we are told that we\n[565.2s] are to follow the steps of\n[568.4s] Christ are to acquire the same education\n[570.9s] that Christ\n[573.8s] acquired I pray that God may help\n[577.3s] us to walk according to the steps of\n[581.8s] Christ because it is the steps of\n[586.2s] Christ that will lead us to\n[589.2s] God I don't want to waste a lot of\n[592.1s] time because today I want you to ask\n[594.6s] questions and\n[597.7s] comment I want us to to the book\n[601.7s] desire I want us to look on how Christ\n[604.8s] acquired\n[607.4s] education then we connect to the book\n[610.3s] first 2 ver\n[614.0s] 21 that if Christ left for us\n[618.1s] example that if we are to be follow the\n[621.4s] lamp wherever he\n[624.8s] go then ucation system will be should be\n[628.2s] that of Christ\n[631.6s] because whatever was perfect in\n[634.6s] Christ should be made perfect in\n[638.4s] us because the book\n[642.7s] of\n[644.4s] 15 my Bible tells me\n[647.6s] something the Bible says that for we\n[651.1s] have not an high priest which cannot be\n[654.3s] touched with our which which cannot be\n[657.4s] touched with the feelings of in\n[660.8s] infirmities but was in all points\n[663.4s] tempted like we are yet without\n[676.0s] sin\n[677.6s] hallelujah hallelujah that Christ was\n[680.5s] temped even as we are\n[683.4s] done that is touch\n[689.9s] [Music]\n[691.2s] that Christ became\n[693.4s] man for us for him to understand what\n[696.5s] man should\n[699.8s] under and therefore whatever he\n[703.1s] under we are to go through\n[705.6s] that the\n[709.8s] book this is p let me check the\n[714.7s] page I'm reading from page six uh page\n[718.9s] 16\n[722.2s] paragraph the testimony says wonderful\n[726.0s] in its\n[729.8s] [Music]\n[731.4s] significance in the brief record of his\n[736.6s] life the\n[737.9s] [Music]\n[739.3s] child\n[741.4s] and and works strong in\n[745.1s] spirit filled with\n[747.5s] wisdom that Christ was with\n[750.4s] what how manying to be like\n[753.7s] Christ we are to be filled with the\n[755.8s] wisdom\n[757.5s] of and therefore we are to walk as\n[761.0s] Christ listen to this and the grace of\n[765.0s] God was upon\n[767.6s] him in the sunlight of his father's\n[774.0s] countenance Jesus increased in wisdom\n[776.7s] and\n[783.6s] and in favor with God and\n[789.6s] man his mind was active and\n[794.7s] [Music]\n[795.8s] penetrating with a thoughtfulness and\n[798.0s] wisdom Beyond his\n[803.2s] ears yet his character was beautiful in\n[806.0s] symmetry\n[809.5s] the power of Mind and\n[813.7s] Body developed gradually in keeping with\n[816.7s] the laws of\n[821.7s] childhood I hope you are listening to\n[823.7s] The Life of\n[826.7s] Christ let me to this\n[830.2s] paragraph This is now 69 paragraph\n[836.8s] 29 it says from the earliest uh\n[843.4s] times the faithful in Israel had given\n[846.4s] much care\n[851.8s] to one of the\n[856.2s] things that very\n[864.0s] and is the education of the\n[867.3s] what the ucation of the\n[872.8s] what we need to see as\n[882.2s] most\n[884.7s] by the Lord directed that even from\n[890.6s] babyhood the children be taught his\n[893.3s] goodness and greatness\n[899.4s] especially red\n[905.0s] in as shown in the history of\n[909.3s] isra song and\n[913.6s] prayer lessons from\n[917.7s] scriptures were to be aded the opening\n[922.8s] mind hallelujah amen what what what was\n[926.2s] to be adapted as the opening mind of\n[928.1s] baby a baby\n[930.3s] child it is what and what song and\n[932.9s] prayer song and pray prayer prayer and\n[936.3s] lessons from the what the\n[942.0s] scures\n[945.4s] me what is made the opening the mind of\n[948.6s] the children\n[950.4s] today is it in prayer and L from the\n[953.2s] scriptures\n[954.5s] [Music]\n[960.0s] you are cutting up\n[976.9s] your he is confused in the\n[980.6s] mind so that when you read ver9\n[985.4s] [Music]\n[989.1s] understand\n[990.7s] that but this is what this is what God\n[993.9s] designed and I think what God designed\n[996.2s] is the best for the children\n[999.4s] of and are to go to must go back to what\n[1003.1s] God\n[1007.6s] des and therefore\n[1010.5s] today much we had G\n[1014.5s] asay that our minds were not opened up\n[1017.2s] by song prayer and listen from scripture\n[1024.5s] the Lord has prepared to bring us back\n[1027.9s] again so that if we listen to his\n[1031.0s] voice come back to his perfect\n[1035.6s] will then we are going to Beed of\n[1040.0s] Heaven let me\n[1041.9s] Contin fathers and\n[1044.8s] mothers were instructed were to instruct\n[1048.3s] their children\n[1051.6s] that the Lord of God is an expression of\n[1054.0s] his\n[1056.4s] character in in the je\n[1061.3s] economy who was to instruct the\n[1064.8s] children who fathers and who\n[1070.0s] mothers and therefore we realize that\n[1072.7s] there age that a child should spend with\n[1074.6s] parents\n[1079.6s] that that is during the Hebrew\n[1083.0s] economy before taken to the school of\n[1095.2s] prophets children do not even take time\n[1097.7s] with their\n[1099.4s] parents that is why today it is very\n[1102.0s] tough to do devotion with young young\n[1104.4s] men like\n[1107.8s] us and even as we try to be in\n[1112.6s] devotions you realize that we are not so\n[1115.7s] serious with it because we are not\n[1117.7s] growing with\n[1121.2s] it we are just trying because we have\n[1124.3s] read and we we are trying that God may\n[1126.3s] help us be of that\n[1130.8s] character if we would be educated in\n[1134.0s] this\n[1135.8s] way then we will be in a perfect by the\n[1138.5s] way\n[1139.8s] we would be\n[1141.0s] good but today we have problems in the\n[1143.4s] Church of\n[1145.6s] God because we were we were not taught\n[1148.2s] in this\n[1149.4s] life but there hope because God is\n[1151.6s] calling us to back back to this\n[1157.5s] program is prepared to receive\n[1162.0s] us it continues by\n[1165.8s] saying and that as they receive the prin\n[1169.1s] OFW into\n[1175.3s] the\n[1179.7s] [Music]\n[1183.8s] mind because we are told the system that\n[1189.2s] designed was to bring back the image of\n[1191.8s] God upon his\n[1195.0s] children I don't know what kind of\n[1197.1s] system education today that kind of\n[1199.0s] system education we have\n[1201.5s] today can it help to bring back theage\n[1204.0s] of\n[1205.9s] God take for example you are studying\n[1209.0s] that Evolution\n[1215.6s] the can you connect can that bring back\n[1218.8s] the image of\n[1221.4s] God see come back to the\n[1226.2s] [Music]\n[1228.8s] going to continue we are going to\n[1231.0s] continue uh in the system of Education\n[1233.7s] that we not bring back the image of\n[1238.7s] God then there might not be Redemption\n[1241.2s] for\n[1242.5s] us because the book of\n[1244.8s] Education\n[1248.9s] says right you will use you will use\n[1252.0s] Asing somewhere\n[1260.7s] it says in the highest\n[1264.2s] sense education and Redemption is one\n[1268.2s] one maybe something like\n[1271.4s] that\n[1274.5s] because so is it in\n[1278.8s] Redemption so we\n[1283.9s] canot I\n[1286.6s] someone can compare\n[1297.4s] [Music]\n[1305.3s] now\n[1306.6s] question if we go in the system of wrong\n[1309.5s] education are we going to be\n[1314.6s] redeemed are we going to be redeemed\n[1318.7s] come back to the principles\n[1322.2s] friends listen to The Life of\n[1325.2s] Christ in the days of\n[1328.1s] Christ City that not provide for the\n[1330.9s] religious instruction to the young wased\n[1333.8s] C of\n[1339.8s] God by the way this\n[1343.1s] church if we don't train our children\n[1346.0s] the right principles\n[1356.2s] are we are told that the one thing that\n[1359.2s] is seen as necessary\n[1364.5s] is by the way by the way we are not\n[1367.1s] teaching people not to go to\n[1370.4s] school if I find somebody not going to\n[1373.0s] school in this\n[1375.3s] class I'll be the one to call the\n[1377.4s] policemen to arrest him\n[1381.4s] because we are the big supporters of\n[1385.6s] UC education is\n[1388.6s] redemption Hallelujah education is\n[1392.4s] what and therefore what we need to\n[1394.4s] support so much is the education of the\n[1396.0s] youth and any other\n[1400.1s] person now we need to be\n[1403.8s] educated but which system ofation are\n[1406.0s] you going to be educated in\n[1409.2s] is it education that is going to bring\n[1410.9s] back the image of God and to fulfill the\n[1412.5s] Plan of\n[1417.5s] Redemption or is it that education that\n[1420.1s] will crowd the mind with unnecessary\n[1422.4s] knowledge and lead to\n[1425.0s] [Music]\n[1429.0s] death now as never\n[1433.6s] before we need to do\n[1437.4s] what we\n[1450.2s] [Music]\n[1458.1s] fa may God really help\n[1460.6s] us that we might come to principle and\n[1463.6s] Beed of\n[1468.9s] now listen to this yet the teaching had\n[1471.6s] become\n[1474.3s] foral tradition had\n[1483.8s] inur are you seeing the apostasy that\n[1487.2s] was found within the\n[1490.4s] nation now tradition the\n[1495.9s] scriptures no no\n[1499.3s] now their system became this\n[1503.9s] way children could do devotion for 10\n[1509.2s] minutes but the other\n[1513.0s] hours is me to learn traditions and\n[1522.6s] theories by the way education by that\n[1525.4s] time\n[1528.7s] when tradition had supped the\n[1538.3s] scriptures they\n[1545.0s] justers but still they do exams\n[1549.7s] on that is when tradition the\n[1555.6s] scriptures I'm in the Life of Christ\n[1565.7s] [Music]\n[1571.8s] I don't know the exactag I am\n[1576.0s] but\n[1577.8s] theth uhuh it continues by saying true\n[1581.6s] education will lead the\n[1584.7s] [Music]\n[1586.3s] youth to seek the\n[1591.4s] Lord if happily they might feel after\n[1597.1s] him and find\n[1599.6s] him but the\n[1602.8s] teachers gave attention to the\n[1605.2s] ceremonies\n[1608.0s] [Music]\n[1625.3s] how many are seeing the system was\n[1629.6s] corrupt that the materials that crowded\n[1632.2s] the\n[1634.1s] mind was worthless to the\n[1637.3s] [Music]\n[1639.0s] land I always use this\n[1642.1s] example someone how many have G School\n[1648.7s] just you have gone under\n[1652.1s] that now are you able to\n[1655.8s] apply IND andms in the Life\n[1660.2s] Today\n[1669.8s] Indi no it was to the Lear the\n[1672.8s] Lear yeah someone is learning now now\n[1676.4s] today you see\n[1678.6s] that the world isg the kind of this that\n[1682.1s] was\n[1686.9s] corrupt ised with\n[1693.9s] unnecessary canot\n[1702.0s] apply\n[1707.1s] m and we pray that God may help\n[1710.4s] us so that we might come back\n[1715.8s] topl let me continue by this we are\n[1719.5s] looking upon the Life of\n[1721.3s] Christ because we realize we need to\n[1723.4s] uplift\n[1724.6s] Christ The Gospel we\n[1729.2s] are and first P 2: 21 told\n[1734.0s] us that Christ suffer living example\n[1741.6s] I'm now bringing you to the Life of\n[1745.0s] Christ continues by\n[1747.5s] saying\n[1750.5s] uh the experience which is obtained\n[1752.9s] through personal acceptance\n[1762.4s] of's and that will not be recognized\n[1765.2s] amen that is what I wanted\n[1768.4s] [Music]\n[1770.8s] let me just get that place I'm looking\n[1772.7s] for\n[1776.4s] it materals was worthless to the\n[1783.3s] learner recognized in the schools of the\n[1786.7s] in the\n[1788.3s] higher that will not be recognized in\n[1791.9s] the high school of\n[1806.1s] not going to be accepted in\n[1808.8s] heaven do you think is going to accept\n[1811.4s] you in\n[1814.0s] heaven if what we have learned is not\n[1816.2s] going to be accepted in\n[1821.2s] [Music]\n[1824.0s] the I don't know how to explain this\n[1828.4s] but\n[1831.8s] USI AC of's\n[1836.1s] [Music]\n[1843.4s] word let me give you an\n[1847.3s] example a young a young lady a young man\n[1850.6s] accept the Sabbath as\n[1858.2s] anding to keep theb should\n[1862.2s] be can that be accepted in the UC system\n[1865.1s] of the world\n[1867.5s] today that is how the system of\n[1872.7s] the look at this they they uh\n[1878.4s] uhuh absorbed in the round\n[1882.0s] of externals\n[1885.7s] [Music]\n[1889.2s] the students found no hours to spend\n[1891.2s] with\n[1895.1s] God they did not hear his\n[1897.8s] voice speaking to the\n[1900.0s] heart in in their\n[1914.8s] search have you\n[1927.1s] looking\n[1928.1s] for they turned away from thece of\n[1931.8s] wisdom who the source of\n[1934.7s] wisdom is the corrup system\n[1942.2s] of the system of the world\n[1945.5s] education in search of knowledge\n[1948.9s] people turn away from\n[1951.2s] God in of\n[1953.3s] knowled someone comes and say never\n[1957.6s] cre\n[1961.4s] some don't\n[1970.4s] know break\n[1974.7s] [Music]\n[1980.2s] we\n[1982.4s] have that is how\n[1985.2s] people from the\n[2002.7s] of and by the\n[2004.8s] way by this time these people turned\n[2007.2s] from the source of\n[2010.1s] widom they still to be\n[2013.8s] Christians one of the things\n[2023.5s] that\n[2032.3s] when you read of the\n[2035.4s] Apostles you realized that in Act CH 6\n[2038.6s] and chter S and chapter\n[2043.2s] 8 Paul Wasing upon the\n[2054.1s] of\n[2060.8s] he convinced Paul that Christ was not\n[2063.7s] the Son of God during the time ofan\n[2074.8s] the book\n[2077.4s] of this things this thinging\n[2081.3s] says the great Essentials of the service\n[2083.8s] of\n[2086.8s] God were\n[2088.8s] neglected the principles of law\n[2091.9s] [Music]\n[2109.5s] the\n[2114.8s] Train the powers of the youth were were\n[2118.5s] repressed\n[2127.7s] [Music]\n[2129.4s] don't\n[2140.9s] exped so this is what the system\n[2150.9s] did mind the mind of a preacher who is\n[2154.0s] preaching this this message today here\n[2156.5s] in front\n[2164.4s] do you know why you can\n[2182.6s] sleep hallelujah amen nowr our example\n[2188.2s] we are to lift up\n[2189.9s] Christ look listen this the Child\n[2197.0s] Jesus re\n[2205.2s] instruction are we calling our\n[2209.2s] Christians are we following\n[2212.4s] Christ Christ never received education\n[2215.8s] in which schools\n[2218.7s] now compare the system of the world\n[2224.4s] today is it the same with the system\n[2226.7s] that I was going among the\n[2230.5s] Jews are they the\n[2242.0s] same listen to what I come to end of\n[2245.1s] this\n[2256.0s] and from the Scrolls of the\n[2262.0s] prophets he\n[2270.6s] learn during the ministry\n[2277.7s] this man\n[2282.4s] us why do you think\n[2284.8s] thews CHR someone was never never\n[2291.3s] Lear someone from the congregation who\n[2293.8s] was listening to the\n[2298.3s] presentation\n[2302.9s] yes he never went to\n[2307.6s] when you were reading a quotation last\n[2312.4s] class we realized that there education\n[2315.1s] that is\n[2318.3s] ESS and if people go to\n[2321.7s] that the world\n[2326.9s] them but was\n[2330.8s] not the same thing is happening here\n[2333.9s] today they look as Christ as someone\n[2336.8s] someone who is not\n[2340.1s] [Music]\n[2341.5s] but those who are going to school and\n[2343.4s] learning\n[2352.6s] there they ask a\n[2354.7s] question how is this person how know\n[2357.9s] this letter having never\n[2362.6s] learn you you see when you are in the\n[2364.9s] school of Christ\n[2368.1s] people will just be wondering at\n[2371.7s] you when people sees you\n[2376.9s] explaining they will be just looking at\n[2378.9s] you and saying where is this\n[2382.5s] person never saw this person going to\n[2386.4s] school but this person is able to\n[2388.6s] explain the Plan of\n[2393.3s] Redemption this man is able to explain\n[2395.5s] Daniel 7\n[2398.2s] this man is able to help us understand\n[2400.3s] is Revelation 6\n[2404.4s] and that is when you

increased in knowled\n[2428.9s] and had full\n[2430.8s] understanding but he never went to\n[2434.5s] Theo to\n[2444.4s] is wisdom is\n[2447.0s] from we have to come back to the true\n[2449.3s] principles that God be\n[2457.4s] no way you can simplify the\n[2462.4s] message I don't know how to\n[2471.7s] [Music]\n[2476.3s] simplify I want to then I go to the book\n[2479.5s] of ration then I

God\n[2515.9s] [Music]\n[2518.8s] says every child May\n[2524.2s] Asus we try to become acquainted with\n[2526.8s] our heavenly\n[2531.5s] father through his\n[2533.9s] word angs will\n[2537.6s] near

of this\n[2586.2s] lesson first Lon 2 first first I'm\n[2592.4s] sorry 26 it says\n[2598.3s] he in\n[2601.5s] me himself also to walk even as he\n[2605.0s] walked\n[2608.4s] that we need to walk as Christ did\n[2612.6s] what we know it is good to uplift Christ\n[2616.3s] in the\n[2619.5s] gospel it is good to talk of the\n[2621.9s] humility of Christ\n[2624.6s] amen it is good to talk about the self\n[2627.7s] sacrificing of Christ in the\n[2632.4s] gospel it is good to talk of Christ\n[2635.4s] kindness\n[2639.1s] but are we talking about the ucation of\n[2642.5s] Christ because it is true we need\n[2654.5s] to\n[2657.9s] like we are to be\n[2662.7s] like look the of\n[2675.8s] that is true my\n[2677.6s] friends I don't reject that but do we\n[2690.7s] the people are to LIF\n[2694.2s] Christ but the education of Christ is TR\n[2697.3s] is is stepped\n[2701.2s] down friends if we are to accomplish\n[2703.6s] this\n[2705.4s] GOP we to be\n[2708.0s] like we\n[2712.6s] have I want to see something in the book\n[2717.5s] of we will be making calls after this\n[2724.9s] lessons 18 ver4\n[2741.4s] [Music]\n[2748.6s] I had many to share\n[2757.0s] I desire that you I only stop from this\n[2761.9s] point now the Book of Revelation 18:\n[2765.5s] with\n[2767.9s] us what what does the Bible say someone\n[2770.5s] to read from the\n[2772.3s] [Music]\n[2775.3s] conation what does it say and I heard\n[2778.7s] another voice from Heaven uhuh saying\n[2781.4s] saying come out of her come out of her\n[2784.4s] people my people that you may that he\n[2787.3s] may be not partakers of her sins and\n[2790.5s] that he receive not of her place amen so\n[2793.0s] there a call to do what\n[2795.1s] come called to do\n[2797.9s] what come out of what now I want I want\n[2801.6s] us to get this because as we are\n[2804.3s] preaching\n[2805.8s] Bon we go to Revelation\n[2809.4s] 17 and we see a\n[2811.5s] woman and we know how to explain how the\n[2813.6s] woman is\n[2815.1s] Catholic and we know how the\n[2819.2s] and we can all see the\n[2821.3s] daughters as the Fallen\n[2825.1s] churches to\n[2830.9s] list11 38 just write that quation you\n[2835.0s] will help\n[2838.0s] someone let me repeat because I\n[2841.3s] see it is p\n[2843.8s] 081 pH 081\n[2847.3s] p 3 it\n[2850.4s] says it says command found in Revelation\n[2857.2s] 184 come out of my\n[2860.6s] people means to come out of those in\n[2866.6s] institutions which will place in the\n[2868.8s] minds of our young\n[2872.3s] people principles which are up to make\n[2875.8s] them join the class of\n[2879.7s] worshipers of which we read in second\n[2882.4s] Timothy\n[2886.4s] 3: having a form\n[2890.5s] ofl but deny the power\n[2894.6s] there as faithful\n[2898.8s] Watchmen we should be just as desires of\n[2902.2s] getting our children out of the popular\n[2904.4s] School\n[2910.6s] as we are called to the to the older\n[2913.6s] people out of the\n[2923.8s] popular are only a a product of\n[2940.8s] the command in Revelation 18 18\n[2945.0s] [Music]\n[2946.9s] ver4 we are calling old men from the\n[2950.0s] Fallen\n[2955.6s] churches it is the same way we need to\n[2957.7s] call from the institions\n[2963.5s] [Music]\n[2966.8s] now if we caller Moses from popular\n[2971.4s] churches then we leave Le in popular\n[2973.8s] institions\n[2983.6s] why it continues to\n[2986.1s] read the the popular churches are only a\n[2990.4s] product of world education\n[3001.6s] so to get at the root of the\n[3006.6s] matter we must separate ourself from\n[3009.8s] from that which creates the\n[3015.0s] [Music]\n[3016.3s] condition in which all the religious\n[3019.1s] world at present finds itself hallelujah\n[3024.1s] amen how many understands that\n[3027.6s] [Music]\n[3038.3s] so if we have to get to the root of that\n[3042.7s] problem for us to destroy the popular\n[3047.8s] churches the populars must also be dest\n[3062.8s] as an example\n[3065.7s] now the same way should be called out\n[3068.4s] from a popular\n[3072.2s] school because if you don't call\n[3075.5s] them then this church is going to be\n[3080.0s] still it is because say\n[3084.8s] [Music]\n[3087.1s] school\n[3093.1s] chular so this person is still going for\n[3099.3s] popular our children still in\n[3102.9s] popular if this old man\n[3108.5s] dies which generation will remain the\n[3111.8s] church the generation that was in\n[3114.0s] popular\n[3118.2s] and when they are from the popular\n[3120.2s] Church education they will make the\n[3122.0s] church to be a\n[3126.3s] [Music]\n[3127.9s] popular so if you\n[3129.9s] don't understand the TR you can just go\n[3132.2s] back thank\n[3133.1s] you if we don't understand the\n[3137.0s] [Music]\n[3140.1s] S we are going to be and going to be\n[3142.9s] called out to come out of this system\n[3150.7s] friends this gospel cannot be\n[3156.0s] simplified this gospel is not\n[3159.8s] preached because we are happy of\n[3163.8s] preaching this gospel is not\n[3166.7s] preached because we see that we we need\n[3170.1s] to\n[3174.0s] preach we yester\n[3177.9s] I was impressed of\n[3179.9s] something that not even explain of\n[3183.1s] action to his\n[3195.0s] friends because they want to explain to\n[3199.6s] theirs people want to explain it to\n[3201.7s] their\n[3202.9s] mothers people want to explain them it\n[3205.6s] to their wives\n[3208.2s] people want to explain this gospel to\n[3209.8s] their\n[3213.2s] brothers time\n[3216.1s] is\n[3222.7s] [Music]\n[3229.3s] know come to theel\n[3234.1s] of we see that the\n[3239.7s] we see that we\n[3245.1s] [Music]\n[3252.2s] needing we to the call\n[3256.8s] that at the end of this Lon we decide to\n[3259.6s] be pray\n[3267.7s] [Music]\n[3282.0s] [Music]\n[3283.9s] are to receive\n[3286.4s] thisel that aref for\n[3293.2s] Christ prepared toed\n[3297.5s] be prepared to sleep in\n[3300.6s] CS be prepared to be\n[3304.5s] moed but if you cannot accept be mocked\n[3307.8s] and Separation by\n[3312.2s] friends there no are going to go with\n[3316.4s] thisel really help us to make decision\n[3320.0s] in Jesus\n[3327.8s] uh yes\n[3333.0s] brother briefly\n[3359.0s] like take for example a teacher who\n[3364.8s] teaching class just answer that briefly\n[3368.2s] just answer\n[3369.9s] that someone from who is in the class\n[3372.4s] who can answer\n[3374.1s] that you want to\n[3384.4s] answerone in fact me I'm a teacher by\n[3390.3s] profession issu is making to have sleep\n[3395.6s] nights because I'm\n[3398.6s] there\n[3405.0s] people she's encouraging them in that\n[3408.0s] imagine in\n[3410.0s] school haveed this message\n[3433.7s] because when this this knowled is devish\n[3436.4s] according to James\n[3450.8s] some I think we are all to\n[3458.5s] come okay there's this thing that having\n[3461.1s] the jewi whatever it is called whatever\n[3463.2s] they down\n[3465.1s] and how to run the\n[3467.7s] schools that that curriculum and then\n[3470.0s] they\n[3471.3s] down is not that Learners to go there to\n[3473.9s] learn\n[3477.8s] but everyone to\n[3480.7s] get so there's a point that\n[3483.8s] they that the teachers are\n[3489.8s] there so I am one of people\n[3501.1s] [Music]\n[3506.6s] time is I don't know what to\n[3511.8s] do seconds by the\n[3519.8s] [Music]\n[3530.3s] way problem the problem why

things that you\n[3811.2s] said\n[3820.5s] but so what I wanted to\n[3824.6s] emphasize that the first thing that we\n[3827.0s] should do is to call people out of the\n[3828.6s] popular schools\n[3831.9s] [Music]\n[3835.9s] the popular churches is that\n[3840.7s] what they go but the first one is call\n[3844.1s] them in fact you can better better\n[3846.4s] better better you don't call them out of\n[3848.4s] popular churches because that that is\n[3851.2s] the product of what is in the popular\n[3853.4s] school they go hand in hand now look the\n[3855.4s] way we are today look the way we are\n[3857.6s] today I'm a\n[3859.3s] teacher the wife of is\n[3862.7s] teer we are having students here people\n[3866.0s] are out of the popular\n[3869.2s] churches what are we\n[3877.9s] making\n[3880.0s] perfecton will be the last\n[3883.8s] but\n[3885.6s] talking you need sometimes to comment we\n[3888.4s] also\n[3890.7s] see is up coming you see\n[3903.7s] heal teacher is coming\n[3915.1s] [Music]\n[3933.9s] yes livelihood\n[3942.2s] [Music]\n[3958.2s] [Music]\n[3969.0s] God is good who teaches more than Christ\n[3971.0s] who teaches\n[3972.8s] more I was there and I was there\n[3987.0s] by the way the Lord has called\n[3989.1s] us and God is going to take care of his\n[3993.7s] works sometimes we can use some\n[3996.5s] something to H you\n[3999.8s] see you see but that is not the thing\n[4002.6s] you see you just want to be there you\n[4004.4s] see so the Lord has called us and is\n[4007.2s] going to take care of his work in Jesus\n[4008.8s] name am let's

I want to inform you that the Bible convention 2025 is ongoing and uh this is our second week and we are terminating it coming this Sabbath. It has been a beautiful uh Bible convention and uh our theme is uh the youth must decide for himself. Our key verse is 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 25 and the dim song is song 523. I need no any other evidence. And therefore it means that each and every youth, each and every woman, each and every child that is going to come out of this convention is going not to need any other evidence because it is enough that Jesus died and uh saved us. Now today, as I had promised yesterday, I'm having a guest with me and uh she's going to give us her little testimony, her little experience, what she uh she have learned so far in this uh one and a half week that we've been having here in this convention. So allow me to welcome my guest whom I'm having. She's going to introduce herself. Uh so I have my guest today and it is another moment that you really need to hear from her that the gospel is spreading and much is still coming more people are coming are calling them in the gospel. So my sister studio young evangelist ministry and uh feel most welcome you get yourself composed and speak to those people who are listening to us online. It's in a special way you can introduce yourself and tell them your name and maybe where you come from and also as we shall progress. I know you have a lot to tell to those people who are listening to us. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you. Uh my name is Jenza. I come from um I'm a member of the oldest church which I've joined recently and I'm very glad to be here. I really thank God for this. All right. Thank you sister Jalenza. Uh I would like to know that uh uh is this your first convention to join with young evangelist ministry? Yes, it is my first. Oh, all right. All right. Thank you. Now uh being that uh it is your first convention, how is your experience so far since you came uh to to this convention? How is your experience? How are the things working with you? Uh my experience is good and I really appreciate the fact that I've been able to meet new cases and even learn a lot of things. Uh I've been able to learn from a lot of things. Very many things. Yeah. I can just mention some of them. Mhm. Like matters to do with two meals per day. It's not very easy because the way it was presented unto us, it seems to be very difficult. But the way I've seen it being done here, it's very easy and by the grace of God, I think all is possible. And also uh I've also come to get to know a lot of truths that I'm really willing wishing that if God could give me strength, I would be able to present them to my fellow especially to my family. All right. Thank you. Thank you so much. Uh viewers, I think you can uh get to understand that uh when it comes to health, it's it is something that is very broad and uh there is a challenge in con in in this convention that two meals is possible and that is what we are working with and it is what has made us to be very healthy. I think as you can see our face are shining meaning that two meals is workable. Praise God. Now, uh, Sister Jalenza, maybe you can tell the viewers some of the truth that are standing out for you that, uh, they have been hidden for long, but by God's grace, you've been in a position to come to their realization. Actually, the truths that have come into, most of them, I've heard of them, but the problem is that they're being presented in a certain way that seems so difficult for someone to accept the one that I said concerning two meals especially I really didn't think it was that way because the way it was presented unto me last year it was so difficult and also matters to do with education and following the thing that um the youth must decide for himself we really need to decide in matters to do education and I know it's not easy but all is possible with God and also we also learned about matter sportship yeah and uh um due to the age that we've reached right now I think it's very important for us to get to know that yeah about also church heritage I really got encouraged listening to the stories of people like Ellen White James White and even his death, what caused his death and the age that he died. And it's a challenge to me, a very big challenge. And it's really makes it makes me to question myself whether I'm I'm really doing something where am I I am. All right. All right. Thank you, Sister Jalenza, for that. So, uh, for those who are following, you can subscribe there. You can like, you can share this uh powerful testimony and I know that God is doing something. So maybe to bring this to a close uh sister uh remind viewers where you said you come from so that uh uh uh we may see because uh I don't know whether a gospel like this has reached home or you have a special request for the ministry so that uh the gospel may reach the parents the gospel may reach your village mates the gospel may reach your hometown and maybe uh h any other place that uh you are closely connected with that you wish the gospel to reach. Thank you. Mhm. My place that is Karungu. I really wish that the gospel reaches that place. And uh also my hometown that is sorry. Mhm. Um also in Homer Bay especially because that is where I spend most of my time. Yeah. All right. So uh our viewers it is apparent that the gospel is expanding.

Welcome back\n[4.1s] uh to all lovers of Young Evangelist\n[7.2s] Ministry and also to all that are first\n[11.1s] time viewers in this channel. I want to\n[14.3s] inform you that the Bible convention\n[17.8s] 2025 is ongoing and uh this is our\n[21.8s] second week and we are terminating it\n[26.1s] coming this Sabbath. It has been a\n[29.1s] beautiful uh Bible\n[31.3s] convention and uh our theme is uh the\n[35.3s] youth must decide for himself. Our key\n[38.7s] verse is 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse\n[42.3s] 25 and the dim song is song\n[47.2s] 523. I need no any other evidence. And\n[51.2s] therefore it means that each and every\n[53.4s] youth, each and every woman, each and\n[56.2s] every child that is going to come out of\n[57.9s] this convention is going not to need any\n[61.4s] other evidence because it is enough that\n[64.3s] Jesus died and uh saved us. Now today,\n[69.0s] as I had promised yesterday, I'm having\n[72.0s] a guest with me and uh she's going to\n[75.4s] give us her little testimony, her little\n[78.4s] experience, what she uh she have learned\n[81.0s] so far in this uh one and a half week\n[84.0s] that we've been having here in this\n[86.6s] convention. So allow me to welcome my\n[88.6s] guest whom I'm having. She's going to\n[90.6s] introduce\n[91.8s] herself. Uh so I have my guest today and\n[96.7s] it is another moment that you really\n[99.8s] need to hear from her that the gospel is\n[103.2s] spreading and much is still coming more\n[106.8s] people are coming are calling them in\n[108.4s] the gospel. So my\n[112.3s] sister studio young evangelist\n[115.2s] ministry and uh feel most welcome you\n[119.2s] get yourself composed and speak to those\n[121.4s] people who are listening to us online.\n[124.4s] It's in a special way you can introduce\n[126.1s] yourself and tell them your name and\n[129.2s] maybe where you come from and also as we\n[133.5s] shall progress. I know you have a lot to\n[136.2s] tell to those people who are listening\n[137.9s] to us. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you. Uh\n[140.9s] my name is\n[142.2s] Jenza. I come from\n[146.0s] um I'm a member of the oldest\n[149.2s] church which I've joined\n[151.6s] recently and I'm very glad to be here. I\n[154.9s] really thank God for this.\n[158.9s] All right. Thank you sister Jalenza. Uh\n[162.6s] I would like to know that\n[165.6s] uh uh is this your first convention to\n[168.1s] join with young evangelist ministry?\n[170.6s] Yes, it is my first.\n[173.1s] Oh, all right. All right. Thank you. Now\n[175.7s] uh being that uh it is your first\n[177.9s] convention, how is your experience so\n[180.0s] far since you came uh to to this\n[183.4s] convention? How is your experience? How\n[185.1s] are the things working with you?\n[187.9s] Uh my experience is\n[190.6s] good and I really appreciate the fact\n[193.0s] that I've been able to meet new cases\n[195.0s] and even learn a lot of things.\n[199.2s] Uh I've been able to learn from a lot of\n[202.0s] things. Very many things. Yeah. I can\n[205.8s] just mention some of them. Mhm. Like\n[208.5s] matters to do with two meals per day.\n[212.2s] It's not very easy because the way it\n[214.8s] was presented unto us, it seems to be\n[217.2s] very difficult. But the way I've seen it\n[218.8s] being done here, it's very easy and by\n[222.2s] the grace of God, I think all is\n[224.8s] possible.\n[226.3s] And also\n[228.4s] uh I've also come to get to know a lot\n[231.1s] of truths that I'm really willing\n[234.0s] wishing that if God could give me\n[236.2s] strength, I would be able to present\n[238.2s] them to my fellow especially to my\n[240.4s] family.\n[241.5s] All right. Thank you. Thank you so much.\n[243.7s] Uh viewers, I think you can uh get to\n[247.1s] understand that uh when it comes to\n[249.8s] health, it's it is something that is\n[252.2s] very broad and uh there is a challenge\n[256.2s] in con in in this convention that two\n[258.9s] meals is possible and that is what we\n[260.9s] are working with and it is what has made\n[263.4s] us to be very healthy. I think as you\n[265.9s] can see our face are shining meaning\n[268.2s] that two meals is workable. Praise God.\n[271.9s] Now, uh, Sister Jalenza, maybe you can\n[275.1s] tell the viewers some of the truth that\n[276.9s] are standing out for you that, uh, they\n[281.1s] have been hidden for long, but by God's\n[284.4s] grace, you've been in a position to come\n[287.5s] to their realization.\n[291.1s] Actually, the truths that have come\n[293.3s] into, most of them, I've heard of them,\n[296.3s] but the problem is that they're being\n[298.1s] presented in a certain way that seems so\n[300.7s] difficult for someone to accept the one\n[303.8s] that I said concerning two meals\n[306.3s] especially I really didn't think it was\n[308.3s] that way because the way it was\n[309.8s] presented unto me last year it was so\n[313.2s] difficult and also matters to do with\n[318.0s] education and following the thing that\n[322.3s] um the youth must decide for\n[325.8s] himself we really need to decide in\n[328.2s] matters to do education and I know it's\n[330.6s] not easy but all is possible with God\n[334.1s] and\n[334.8s] also we also learned about matter\n[337.4s] sportship yeah and uh\n[341.9s] um due to the age that we've reached\n[344.9s] right now I think it's very important\n[348.2s] for us to get to know that yeah about\n[351.9s] also church heritage I really got\n[354.6s] encouraged listening to the stories of\n[357.0s] people like Ellen White James White and\n[359.8s] even his death, what caused his death\n[362.1s] and the age that he died. And it's a\n[364.9s] challenge to me, a very big\n[368.0s] challenge. And it's really\n[370.8s] makes it makes me to question myself\n[373.5s] whether I'm I'm really doing something\n[376.2s] where am I I am. All right. All right.\n[379.8s] Thank you, Sister Jalenza, for that. So,\n[383.1s] uh, for those who are following, you can\n[384.5s] subscribe there. You can like, you can\n[386.9s] share this uh powerful testimony and I\n[389.9s] know that God is doing something. So\n[391.6s] maybe to bring this to a close uh sister\n[394.4s] uh remind viewers where you said you\n[396.2s] come from so that uh uh uh we may see\n[399.5s] because uh I don't know whether a gospel\n[402.1s] like this has reached home or you have a\n[404.8s] special request for the ministry so that\n[407.4s] uh the gospel may reach the parents the\n[410.6s] gospel may reach your village mates the\n[412.6s] gospel may reach your hometown and maybe\n[416.0s] uh h any other place that uh you are\n[419.4s] closely connected with that you wish the\n[421.4s] gospel to reach. Thank you. Mhm.\n[425.8s] My place that is Karungu. I really wish\n[428.6s] that the gospel reaches that place. And\n[431.4s] uh also my hometown that is sorry. Mhm.\n[434.8s] Um also in Homer Bay especially because\n[438.0s] that is where I spend most of my time.\n[440.4s] Yeah.\n[442.3s] All right. So uh our\n[445.2s] viewers it is apparent that the gospel\n[449.3s] is\n[450.8s] expanding. So we have a solemn mission\n[453.9s] in Karungu and I know that by God's\n[457.0s] grace it is going to be organized so\n[459.4s] that in Jalenza's place also the gospel\n[462.5s] to\n[463.2s] reach so that the world to be warned\n[466.0s] when this probation is still lingering.\n[470.0s] We request a special support from you so\n[473.7s] that may help the ministry to expand to\n[477.1s] expand its borders.

You need to be a musician. No songs that do not believe in God but songs to the fallen moon. I want to read MH. Let us go to MH minister healing page 54. [Music] I just tell you 254.1 my brother say let praise and thanksgiving express it. Let praise and thanksgiving be expressed when tempted. When tempted when tempted when it's [Music] simply let us give a song of thanksgiving of thanksgiving to it when God giving of our what Let us f our songs of thanksgiving to children 18 this one example of that you have been given that you need to read what 8:18 says that we do do we have example Couple of songs you need to sing when tempted. 8:18 we praise thee. Pick the mic. Sister Pendle, pick the mic. You want to sing this example. Let us be there. He want us to sing. Oh [Music] Jesus [Music] glory by the glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The glory we praise the God for the [Music] spirit. Hallelu the glory. Hallelujah. Hallelu glory again. [Music] Glory. the way the glory glorifle. is so hallelujah Okay. 55 [Music] 54.1 praise and thanksgiving. Let praise and thanksgiving be impressive. When tempted, not that down. When tempted, instead of giving utterance to our feelings, instead of giving utterance for our feelings, let us by faith a song of thanksgiving, lift up a song of thanksgiving to God. Just continue. Paragraph 2 says, \"Yeah, paragraph 2 says, \"We praise thee, oh God, the son of the son of thy lamb to Jesus who died and is now gone above. We embrace thee. We embrace thee, oh God. Thy spirit of light usually continue by saying our shown as our savior and scattered our scattered our [Music] night to the lamb that was slain. into the lamb that was slain, who was born, who has bought our sins, has cleansed every s and has cleansed every stain, and praise to God of all and praise to God of all grace us who has brought us and us and us and guided our ways, guided our ways. Amen. Amen. So s we need to pray. We're in the valley of temptation. Amen. Amen. We need to spend our time in singing songs. [Music] How did Christ overcame? Was Christ temped? Yes. How did he overcome during the time of temptation? And then it says in SD sons and daughters of God page 8 number six it says in how did Christ overcome how did Christ overcome that how did Christ over when others are impatient when others are impatientful complaining because when people are complaining even in the church Today when people are complaining, people are in because what? Because self is not. So what is the problem the church is? What we need to do? begin to sing some of the songs of God. So when people are impatient when people are complaining too much when there is confusion and disunion in the church instead of also joining in muring hey he hey hey what do you need to do you need to do what how many are practical you know we need I taught I taught theory from from one entire How many practical they are saying that this can be applied that when we are tempted when they are confused in the church we are saying that [Music] continue reading it continue by saying when Christ was working at the bench others sometimes others were sometimes trying to cause trying to cause him to be impatient. He will begin singing some of the beautiful songs before realizing. Amen. Amen. Right. This is how you use the square me upside down. Then Christ will not complain. Amen. Amen. He will just begin doing what? Singing. Singing some beautiful what? Singing some beautiful words. And those people forget they join in what? In singing. That is how we are going to overcome in the last days. Amen. Amen. We are in our duties. When people are complaining, people are impatient, people want just to ignite you to sin. What you need to do is to begin singing. Just think we praise thee for the light of thy then those people will just join you. By the way, there is there is the power of music in influencing. How many have ever read that music is a power in influencing the mind to the right channel when rightly what used rightly used? That is how Christ that is how Christ overcome. Go to the book of evangelism very fast. Evangelism 510 and number three it says it say it says God is glorified. God is glorified by songs and praise from pure heart. By songs and praise from a pure heart filled with love and devotion to him. So God is glorified by songs or praise from what? Pure heart. From a pure heart. So to me before we be singers we need to have a pure what? Pure heart. That is the prayer. I think it is proverbs 23 says that guide all your heart with all diligence for out of the heart is the is we can read that verse. So for us to give songs that are going to praise God songs that are going to draw the enemy away their hearts need to be pure. Amen. Amen. Keep thy heart in all. Keep thy heart in all of the issues of out of the art and the issues of what? Of so going to keep our heart when tempted. If you are going to offer songs of praise, we are going to have victory over sin and our songs will go for praises glorifying God. They are going to draw the enemy. What? Are we? Amen. Amen. Question. Can those who do not study the Bible sing? Those who do not study the scriptures, can they be singers? I just want to you and please I want to conclude. You are you don't study the Bible. How many do study their Bibles by the daily? One, two, three. What about all of the remaining? How many do sing daily? This church people are becoming toughed. Are you becoming sing? How many do you sing daily? How many of songs today can those who do not study the Bible be allowed to sing? No. Why? Huh? In church or where? Singing is for the church. In church. Yeah. Can we sing in the church not study the Bible? [Music] Do we have songs today that are not biblical? Yes. Like the Louis know that there's a song say are they biblical? So we want to read evangelism 58. It says note that someone did not study the Bible cannot be amen. It says those who those whose hearts are in the effort are in the effort in their efforts to reach the people in their efforts to reach the people. The Lord's messengers are not to follow the ways of the world. The Lord messengers are not to follow the ways of the world. In the meeting in the meeting that are that in the meeting that we are of the world, they are not to depend on. We are not to depend on worry singers theoretical and theoretical display to awaken the interest. How can those who have the word of God that how can those who have no interest in the word of God to understand is truth be expected be expected to receive to sing with the spirit and understanding. So those who the Bible cannot sing in the spirit and that is why today we have songs the father and the son and the holy word they sing without the spirit and understand the main root cause is that they don't study the what so we cannot have singers in the church who do not study the bible so if you want to sing the bible must be the foundation of your songs. Amen. Amen. That is why we read select spirit of prophecy single students are going to sing songs that are going to give God's glory. We are going to see that if you trace music in the sanctuary, you will come to understand that the sons of the were given the duty of watch and they were still they were trusted by the only what they chose them trained them. They were studying the Bible even in the time of Nemiah 88. We tell that they were dedicated studying the pages to 509.1 that the same 509.1 only sweet simple sing only sweet simple singing sweet simple singing how how can God be glorified how God be glorified when you singing when you depend for your singing. So the problem today is that the choirs we have sing for what? Can we hire choirs to come and sing for us? We pay them.

So what is the\n[971.6s] problem the church\n[976.0s] is? What we need to do?\n[982.2s] begin to sing some of the songs of God.\n[985.9s] So when people are\n[987.6s] impatient when people are complaining\n[990.2s] too much when there is confusion and\n[993.5s] disunion in the\n[995.4s] church instead of also joining in muring\n[998.7s] hey he hey hey what do you need to do\n[1002.5s] you need to do what how many are\n[1004.8s] practical you know we need I taught I\n[1007.5s] taught theory from from\n[1009.5s] one entire\n[1012.3s] How many practical they are saying that\n[1015.3s] this can be applied that when we are\n[1017.1s] tempted when they are confused in the\n[1019.0s] church we are saying that\n[1023.3s] [Music]\n[1026.4s] continue reading\n[1028.8s] it continue by\n[1033.4s] saying when Christ was working at the\n[1036.4s] bench others sometimes others were\n[1040.0s] sometimes trying to\n[1043.3s] cause trying to cause him to be\n[1045.8s] impatient.\n[1050.1s] He will begin singing some of the\n[1052.3s] beautiful\n[1055.0s] songs before realizing.\n[1065.4s] Amen.

In\n[1094.4s] singing.\n[1097.5s] That is how we are going to overcome in\n[1099.1s] the last days. Amen. Amen. We are in our\n[1101.8s] duties. When people are complaining,\n[1103.6s] people are impatient, people want just\n[1106.3s] to ignite you to sin. What you need to\n[1109.1s] do is to begin singing. Just think we\n[1112.3s] praise thee for the light of\n[1115.6s] thy then those people will just join\n[1118.1s] you. By the way, there is there is the\n[1120.2s] power of music in influencing. How many\n[1122.5s] have ever read that music is a power in\n[1125.4s] influencing the mind to the right\n[1127.2s] channel when rightly what used rightly\n[1131.6s] used? That is how Christ that is how\n[1135.2s] Christ overcome. Go to the book of\n[1137.4s] evangelism very\n[1139.5s] fast. Evangelism 510 and number three it\n[1144.1s] says it say it says God is glorified.\n[1147.4s] God is glorified by songs and praise\n[1150.3s] from pure heart. By songs and praise\n[1153.2s] from a pure heart filled with love and\n[1155.8s] devotion to him. So God is glorified by\n[1158.8s] songs or praise from what? Pure heart.\n[1162.5s] From a pure heart. So to me before we be\n[1165.9s] singers we need to have a pure what?\n[1168.2s] Pure heart. That is the prayer. I think\n[1171.7s] it is proverbs\n[1174.0s] 23 says that guide all your heart with\n[1177.6s] all diligence for out of the heart is\n[1179.5s] the\n[1180.8s] is we can read that\n[1183.9s] verse. So for us to give songs that are\n[1186.6s] going to praise God songs that are going\n[1188.6s] to draw the enemy\n[1190.0s] away their hearts need to be pure. Amen.\n[1193.4s] Amen.\n[1197.3s] Keep thy heart in all. Keep thy heart in\n[1201.8s] all of the issues of out of the art and\n[1206.2s] the issues of what? Of so going to keep\n[1209.1s] our heart when tempted. If you are going\n[1212.4s] to offer songs of praise, we are going\n[1215.6s] to have victory over sin and our songs\n[1218.8s] will go for praises glorifying God. They\n[1222.3s] are going to draw the enemy. What? Are\n[1225.0s] we? Amen. Amen. Question.\n[1228.2s] Can those who do not study the Bible\n[1231.0s] sing? Those who do not study the\n[1233.1s] scriptures, can they be\n[1234.9s] singers? I just want to you and please I\n[1238.0s] want to conclude. You are you don't\n[1239.4s] study the Bible. How many do study their\n[1242.0s] Bibles by the\n[1244.7s] daily? One, two,\n[1248.4s] three. What about all of the remaining?\n[1254.0s] How many do sing\n[1260.7s] daily? This church people are becoming\n[1265.2s] toughed. Are you becoming sing? How many\n[1269.2s] do you sing daily?\n[1273.2s] How many of songs\n[1277.5s] today can those who do not study the\n[1279.8s] Bible be allowed to sing?\n[1284.2s] No.\n[1285.3s] Why? Huh?\n[1288.6s] In church or where?\n[1291.8s] Singing is for the church. In church.\n[1294.2s] Yeah. Can we sing in the church not\n[1297.1s] study the Bible?\n[1299.5s] [Music]\n[1310.0s] Do we have songs today that are not\n[1311.8s] biblical? Yes.\n[1315.6s] Like the Louis know that there's a song\n[1325.5s] say are they biblical?\n[1332.4s] So we want to read evangelism\n[1335.8s] 58. It says note that someone did not\n[1339.7s] study the\n[1340.8s] Bible cannot be\n[1343.9s] amen. It\n[1345.6s] says those who those whose hearts are in\n[1350.0s] the effort are in the effort in their\n[1352.5s] efforts to reach the people in their\n[1354.4s] efforts to reach the people. The Lord's\n[1356.4s] messengers are not to follow the ways of\n[1358.6s] the world. The Lord messengers are not\n[1360.9s] to follow the ways of the world. In the\n[1363.5s] meeting in the meeting that\n[1366.4s] are that in the meeting that we are of\n[1370.8s] the world,\n[1373.2s] they are not to depend on. We are not to\n[1376.7s] depend on worry\n[1379.1s] singers theoretical and theoretical\n[1384.6s] display to awaken the interest. How can\n[1388.3s] those who have the word of God that how\n[1392.1s] can those who have no interest in the\n[1394.3s] word of\n[1401.0s] God to understand is truth be expected\n[1405.0s] be expected to receive to sing with the\n[1408.6s] spirit and understanding. So those who\n[1411.7s] the Bible cannot sing in the spirit\n[1415.5s] and that is why today we have\n[1418.4s] songs the father and the son and the\n[1420.6s] holy\n[1422.5s] word they sing without the spirit and\n[1425.7s] understand the main root cause is that\n[1428.2s] they don't study the what so we cannot\n[1431.1s] have singers in the church who do not\n[1433.1s] study the\n[1435.0s] bible so if you want to sing the bible\n[1438.0s] must be the foundation of your songs.\n[1440.0s] Amen. Amen. That is why we read\n[1443.4s] select spirit of\n[1446.6s] prophecy\n[1454.5s] single\n[1456.7s] students are going to sing songs that\n[1459.2s] are going to give God's glory. We are\n[1462.2s] going to see that if you trace music in\n[1464.2s] the sanctuary, you will come to\n[1466.5s] understand that the sons of the were\n[1468.7s] given the duty of watch and they were\n[1471.6s] still they were trusted by the only\n[1475.1s] what they chose them trained them. They\n[1478.5s] were studying the Bible even in the time\n[1481.3s] of Nemiah 88. We tell that they were\n[1484.1s] dedicated studying\n[1486.2s] the\n[1490.1s] pages to\n[1493.7s] 509.1 that the\n[1499.7s] same\n[1501.5s] 509.1 only sweet simple sing only sweet\n[1505.6s] simple singing sweet simple\n[1508.6s] singing how how can God be glorified how\n[1512.7s] God be glorified when\n[1515.1s] you singing when you depend for your\n[1517.9s] singing.\n[1521.4s] So the problem today is that the choirs\n[1523.8s] we have sing for what?\n[1527.5s] Can we hire choirs to come and sing for\n[1529.6s] us? We pay them. I had a brother T\n[1532.8s] saying that you know in our next\n[1535.6s] competing we are going to call those who\n[1537.9s] are from Tanzania. We're going to How\n[1540.2s] many are that? They're going to call\n[1542.8s] them. Can we hire them? Come and sing\n[1545.1s] for\n[1546.0s] us. Brother Koski, can we hire those who\n[1549.8s] are singing beautiful? By the way, those\n[1551.5s] in Tanzania are singing beautiful what\n[1557.4s] songs? Can we hire them to come and sing\n[1560.0s] for us?\n[1564.0s] Not hire, but call. You can call but not\n[1567.2s] hire. We can call but not\n[1570.1s] hire. Do they sing for\n[1572.9s] money? So my question is that can we\n[1575.4s] hire them? They come they sing for us\n[1578.0s] for two weeks. We give them something\n[1581.1s] give\n[1581.9s] them send offh\n[1586.8s] we we f them when they are coming then\n[1589.4s] we give them send off. We that is we\n[1591.8s] have hired them to come and sing for us.\n[1594.8s] We need\n[1598.6s] you can express for us please.\n[1601.6s] Yes. Because also evangelist evangelist\n[1605.0s] are not being hired but they are being\n[1607.7s] it means that we are also working for\n[1609.3s] man. Okay. So what is the meaning of\n[1612.4s] hiring? I've hired a tendant at the end\n[1615.0s] of the the occation I pay the send off.\n[1619.3s] The agreement on hiring ts. Uhhuh. How\n[1622.2s] much do you hire these tents for? for\n[1624.6s] two weeks 100 shillings per day will\n[1627.5s] give you for 1400 shillings. Mhm. Yeah.\n[1631.4s] But if you say can you help me with your\n[1633.9s] yes I can help you with but when you say\n[1637.0s] have this 1,000 as a thank you I don't\n[1640.7s] understand. So what is the meaning of\n[1642.2s] hiring?\n[1644.2s] Working on a money basis. An agreement.\n[1647.3s] An agreement. Okay. Read, read, read. It\n[1651.7s] says that glorified. How can God be\n[1654.9s] glorified?\n[1658.2s] When you depend for\n[1663.2s] your command,\n[1667.1s] my right. When you see these things in a\n[1670.2s] right light, you will have in your\n[1672.0s] meeting.\n[1673.8s] You will have in your meeting\n[1676.4s] only singing the congregation the whole\n[1680.8s] congregation to join in the song to join\n[1683.4s] in the song.\n[1687.0s] What if among those who are now present\n[1689.2s] here\n[1693.4s] their voices are not music\n[1697.0s] musical.\n[1699.0s] at the voice of others.\n[1705.1s] When the singing is that such that\n[1706.6s] angels can unite with the\n[1711.1s] singer singing from\n[1714.8s] than singing that sanctified lips\n[1717.3s] cannot. So we are not even to depend on\n[1720.0s] worldly. Jump to the next page. I want\n[1723.0s] us to help me understand this question.\n[1729.1s] Yes. Now read paragraph three.\n[1733.0s] The answer is there.\n[1735.2s] 549.3. Write that. It says it says it\n[1739.7s] says musical help offer. Accepted\n[1743.8s] musical help offer in the meetings.\n[1747.1s] Listen to this. In the meetings in the\n[1749.9s] meeting, in the meeting singing should\n[1753.5s] not be neglected. The singing should not\n[1755.9s] be neglected. Neglected. God can be\n[1759.0s] glorified. God can be glorified.\n[1761.8s] Part of the service by this part of the\n[1764.0s] service. And when singers offer their\n[1766.3s] services, when singers offer their\n[1768.5s] services, they should be accepted. They\n[1771.0s] should be accepted. Amen. So singing\n[1773.5s] should not be neglected. Amen. We need\n[1776.6s] even to make a program where we have\n[1779.6s] seasonal singing. Amen. We just have\n[1785.1s] They just\n[1794.1s] okay just read it say that it says but\n[1797.9s] money not that but money shall not be\n[1801.0s] used to higher sins but money shall not\n[1804.2s] be used to higher sins but money should\n[1807.5s] not be used to higher so you cannot you\n[1811.1s] cannot sit and agree with the people\n[1813.0s] that come sing for us for 2 weeks. They\n[1815.9s] give you the amount. In 2 weeks we are\n[1818.9s] going to give us 50. We need not to use\n[1822.2s] our money to what? That is what is\n[1825.1s] happening in the churches we left. What\n[1827.8s] about here?\n[1832.6s] Just read it says\n[1836.9s] the thinging of simple in the\n[1838.9s] congregation by the congregation has a\n[1842.1s] not possessed has a ch that is not\n[1844.2s] possessed by the singing of the singing.\n[1850.3s] However it may be so much not used.\n[1855.0s] However the singers are skilled,\n[1858.8s] however, they Amen. Amen. However\n[1862.0s] skillful they may. Amen. Money should\n[1864.3s] not be used. Why? What? Yes.\n[1867.7s] I think that is\n[1873.6s] understood. 510.5 jump 510.\n[1878.3s] It says then you go to five. I want to\n[1881.4s] conclude because time was much spent. It\n[1884.4s] says I want to write down that qualities\n[1887.1s] of good\n[1888.2s] music. As I\n[1890.7s] conclude, I want to make a call. It says\n[1893.8s] it says qualities of good music\n[1897.0s] qualities of good music\n[1899.8s] great improvement can be made in singing\n[1902.5s] can be made in singing. Something that\n[1904.8s] the louder they sing. Notice this. Some\n[1907.6s] think that the louder they sing Some\n[1909.6s] think that the louder they sing. Some\n[1912.0s] think that the louder they sing, the\n[1914.4s] more they make, the more music they\n[1917.2s] make. Three. But noise is what? But\n[1920.8s] noise is not\n[1922.7s] noises. The people saying\n[1926.1s] make I had people singing today. Are you\n[1929.8s] singing or making noise? I had people\n[1933.2s] sing. Why you singing all noise?\n[1936.9s] singing.\n[1939.7s] Why? Why are people so silent? You know,\n[1943.1s] when you're teaching a child, a church\n[1944.9s] is\n[1946.0s] silent. Why you people singing or making\n[1948.4s] noise?\n[1950.7s] Singing.\n[1952.2s] Singing. You are singing. But something\n[1954.8s] that the louder they sing, they won't\n[1958.0s] sing. Noise is not what? Noise is not.\n[1961.2s] But today all singers want to make\n[1962.9s] noise. Just listen to all composition of\n[1965.5s] songs. today is they want to y the song\n[1971.0s] just begin then it is in\n[1973.4s] climax. There are times when I was\n[1975.9s] listening to worldly music some years\n[1993.4s] back. But but now\n[1999.4s] today so\n[2004.2s] I don't know 510 I want to conclude I\n[2007.4s] want to make a call by the\n[2009.5s] way 510 paragraph 5 listen to this\n[2012.5s] carefully it says it says it says in\n[2015.4s] some now in some of our\n[2019.1s] churches I have even solos that were\n[2022.2s] going to be unable for the service of\n[2024.4s] the Lord's house they were unsuitable\n[2026.3s] for the service of the Lord's house the\n[2028.4s] long drawn out not the long brought out\n[2031.4s] not And the peular sound. The pecular\n[2034.8s] sound common in\n[2037.8s] common\n[2039.0s] in operetic singing singing are not\n[2042.8s] pleasing to the angels are not pleasing\n[2044.9s] to the ears of the angels.\n[2048.0s] Delight to hear of praise. They delight\n[2051.3s] to hear the simple songs of praise s in\n[2054.2s] a natural s in a natural tone. The songs\n[2057.7s] in which everyone is uttered. The song\n[2060.9s] is The song in which every word is\n[2064.2s] uttered. Every word is uttered. Every\n[2066.6s] word is uttered clearly. Every word is\n[2069.1s] uttered clearly in a tone in a musical\n[2073.2s] tone. And join\n[2078.5s] us in singing. And the song in which the\n[2081.3s] angels join us in singing. Read.\n[2084.0s] They refrain. They take up the refrain.\n[2087.3s] That is from the heart. That is from the\n[2091.5s] heart with the spirit and the what?\n[2094.9s] Yeah. So even followers do me make\n[2097.5s] mistake. They want just to draw long\n[2102.3s] note. It says this is what I want to\n[2105.6s] read. It says is it do read on 3004? He\n[2110.2s] said it says\n[2112.7s] now the Lord has taught us many things.\n[2114.5s] How many so from the past lesson that\n[2116.3s] the Lord has revealed things to us that\n[2119.2s] we need to correct. How many how many\n[2121.8s] are convicted that the Lord has revealed\n[2123.7s] to us things we need to correct. Listen\n[2126.4s] to this. It says, it says, it says, the\n[2129.2s] Lord has revealed to me, the Lord has\n[2131.3s] revealed to me that when the heart is\n[2133.4s] cleansed, that when the heart is\n[2135.2s] cleansed, I will sanctify sanctified the\n[2138.3s] members of the church are partakers of\n[2140.2s] the divine nature. The members of the\n[2142.0s] church are partakers of the divine\n[2143.6s] nature, our power will go forth. Our\n[2145.9s] power will go forth from the church.\n[2148.1s] from the church\n[2150.2s] who believe the truth that cause men in\n[2153.4s] the heart that will cause melody in the\n[2155.7s] art. Men and Men and women will not\n[2159.5s] depend upon their instrumental.\n[2162.2s] Note that men and women will not depend\n[2164.2s] upon instrumental what? Full of drums,\n[2167.4s] full of jest.

So uh so far uh do you have a series that is still remaining or a topic that is still remaining that you need to handle maybe coming days? Yeah. uh we only have I only have one class remaining that class is tomorrow and I will be able to clarify everything and bring it to summary that the topic of tomorrow is that a youth must now decide for themselves. All right that is very powerful. So uh beloved we've been uh having that powerful topic and we came to the realization that uh this is the third angel's message and in rejecting this truth that God is giving to his church. It is like rejecting the entire message that Adventism have. Yeah, that is true that education was we realized that the birthight of reformation. We realize that the plan of redemption is the dem of the Bible. Education is redemption. And therefore, if someone rejects the education, such a person has rejected the whole Bible. Oh, so no one is going to go to heaven without being educated because heaven is a school. Oh, it is just promotion over the next class. That is so powerful. So the theme the central theme of the scripture is is redemption or salvation and we said that education and salvation is more or less the same. They are inseparable. You cannot separate education and redemption. In other words in the highest sense education and redemption are one. For as in education so is in redemption. So it means that the central theme of the scripture is education. That is that is in other words. So thank you. Thank you so much um um to Mishnik. I think that is very powerful and uh the viewers can actually get it in that deeper sense and I know that God is going to help us. Sure. So uh viewers what we are saying about education here we have series of studies that are presented in our playlist down there. You can actually get the link in our description. So just go and view all those uh presentations concerning education because it is that powerful one. So maybe uh um to Mr. Jeff. Yes. You can tell us maybe uh uh the response are you can you you can see from uh those whom you are handling in class what is are you seeing members and are understanding this message or it is what can you tell us? Thank you for that question but I know that uh when a meeting is made like this people should not just come to the meeting and go back home with an an empty mind and therefore as a teacher we need to be we need to understand or we need to engage all the delegates so that you be sure that whatever you are teaching or the whatever you are presenting must be understood by all the delegates and at the same time we know and understand that all things who are taken to the YouTube we are sure that the viewers who are going to view our channel will be able But for now that we had the series of studies that we had as well assure you that the delegates are able to understand and you see when you make a call and you see people make a step of of joining the to be prayed for it is very sure that those people are understanding what is being taught. Therefore in the classes of education I saw people getting to understand what redemption is because all of us we are deciding to be set to be saved. No one will not desire not to be saved to be saved because what we want is redemption. That's the central theme what is to be preached and therefore people must understand the plan of redemption and I saw that they were able to understand it. Oh all right thank you. Thank you uh evangelist Jeffnik. So uh our viewers I would like to inform you that this is just one of the speakers of this convention and uh he has played a key role uh by giving us the topic about the true education and I know that this is one of the subjects that is bringing contention among the reformers among the children even of the world. So uh I would wish that uh may God help us and uh if you want to learn more as I've said just go back to our the description down there I'm going I'm going to put a link that is going to direct you to all those series about education. Now to bring this to a close uh uh um to Mishi. Yes. Uh we have uh many people who are are still not having the depth understanding when it comes to education. So maybe what can you tell them where where did you get all these informations from so that their minds may be directed well to get the right understanding as you do? What can you tell them? Where is the where do we get all these truths from or where did you learn all these truths about education? Thank you for that. One of the thing that I will desire to tell the viewers that if we don't understand what education is in other words we cannot get you cannot be redeemed. In other words, you cannot be saved without education. And therefore it comes to a personal uh responsibility to everyone that everyone who desiring for eternal life must strive to understand the true science of what? Education. And therefore like we said as we beginning that the central theme of the Bible is educate education. One of our things that we need to understand that the Bible will always en line 10 human mind on every point of doctrine in everything because the book that is 2 Timothy 3:16 says that all things in the scriptures are there to train us so that we might be good people and therefore one of the sources of the truth that is going to sanctify the soul and lead to the perfect redemption are in the in the Bible that is why we are always being admonished that we need to study the Bible daily. Amen. And therefore, us being an Adventist, another source of our truth, we know as Adventist that our creed is the the Bible. We realize that God gave the church the gift of the spirit of what? Prophecy. And therefore, there's also another source of light that is the spirit of through prophecy. And we believe that the spirit of prophecy is manifested in the writings of Ellen Ellen White. And Ellen White is also speaking that let the dead speak, the dead speak. M says that the dead speak for people of God living in the last days we need to understand what the servant of God meaning because the dead cannot do what cannot speak and therefore she explains that can only speak through their what their writings and she says we need to study the writings of pioneers pioneers like Jones Stephankell log James White we need to study their work their work I tell that Stephan was explaining the book of Daniel chapter 4. You go to expl when he explains Daniel chapter 11, the whole theme of Daniel chapter 4 and Daniel chapter 11 is always that system of educ education and is trying to tell us that we need to have an education education that is higher than the even education the universities of the the world because that is the only education that is going to be accepted in heaven. Let me assure the viewers that the education can only be obtained in the schools of the pro the prophets prophets and therefore God is calling us to be men who are going to study the scriptures and the spirit of prophecy enlightening the truth in Jesus name. Oh thank you thank you to me. Uh there is this book that uh you've used so much written by someone like uh stherlands. Yeah. Uh what is the title of that book? The title of that book is uh studies on Christian education. studies on Christian education. Can you recommend it to the viewers because it is such a powerful book when it comes to education. Thank you for that. I'll recommend it to the viewers. Number one, we need to understand that Southerntherlands was a principle, a teacher in the Madison school. Madison school is a school that was established by the seventh adventist and therefore he explains and I let me just give them a brief overview of what is in the book. If you want to know the history of 1844, what happened to the remuneration of 1844, the best book to study is studies on Christian education by Netherlands. And therefore, children of God who are listening to me, what you need to understand that each one of us needs to get that book to study it deeply and therefore those things that happened to each movement happened unto them for our examples that we seventh day Adventists who are living in the last days need to understand our position as a people. spoken. Amen. Thank you. Thank you, Mishi. That is powerful. So, uh viewers, there is a book called studies on Christian education written by one who is speaking at a point of information that is southerntherlands. So, in the description go down there uh I've attached the link to the book and uh I know that it is going to be a great blessing. He was one of the principles in Madison school and we know that Madison school is the blueprint where we can find the blueprint of true education. So I I hope you are blessed and uh maybe uh um Tumishi. Yes. Uh maybe as we bring this to a close you can uh give us maybe your last remarks. uh you can give the viewers your last remark just just in a in a nutshell or in a in a short way so that uh the viewers can uh can actually know that uh uh the ministry is doing much and uh there are a lot of people that actually they don't understand these truths. So what can you maybe as you give your close remarks what can you tell us? What I can tell the viewers is that uh now as never before we need to understand the two science of education. If we fail to understand this we shall not have a place in the kingdom of god of of god. Therefore let's try let's get connected to the ministry through our media so that we need to we we we understand the true science of education and that is eternal life. All right. Amen. Thank you. So uh thank you so much for uh watching up to this far and uh I know it has been a blessing. It has been uh an insightful discussion and we still ask for your support. uh those who love the truth, we still ask of your support because uh the other day we were having a brother from SIA and uh he really wish that the truth to reach the home and you saw that one of the truth that he rejoiced in is the true education. The other day we are also also having a sister called Jalenza from Karungu. She also rejoiced in the message of the true education. So it means that youths are accepting this message. The parents are accepting this message and also uh the children and therefore we we really uh request your support so that we may uh uh make this truth now to be realistic by establishing our own institutions by establishing our own vocational trainings through your supports. God's work needs people that needs people that are going to join forces in these last days to bring support to the cause of God. Otherwise, may God bless you all. I know you are going to respond positively when the duty is going to call. Thank you and may God bless you. M",

I wish that you may send\n[108.2s] your greetings. you can introduce\n[110.6s] yourself and maybe we can proceed from\n[113.2s] that. Oh, thank you for that brother\n[115.8s] Byron for welcoming welcoming me to the\n[118.9s] young evangelist media. I greet all\n[122.3s] viewers in the name of our Lord and\n[124.2s] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. So, uh\n[127.2s] I'm Evangelist Jeff. Jeff Muching was\n[130.8s] one of the guests that were ministering\n[133.6s] and to the delegates that were attended\n[135.9s] this convention in the topic of the true\n[139.3s] the teacher of truth only safe educator.\n[142.6s] I'm glad to be here with you and I thank\n[144.7s] God that the Lord has allowed us to\n[146.2s] reach this moment and uh we hope that as\n[149.1s] we coming to the end of this convention\n[151.2s] the objectives of the meeting are going\n[153.1s] to be met and all delegates will be\n[154.9s] going back our youth will be able to\n[156.7s] decide for himself. All right. All\n[159.0s] right. Thank you uh uh evangelist Jeff\n[162.2s] that is so powerful. So you've been\n[165.1s] handling uh the the class the uh the\n[169.4s] true educator. Mhm. The safe what? The\n[172.6s] teacher of truth. The safe only safe\n[174.8s] educator. Only safe educator. Yeah,\n[177.0s] that's the topic. So uh so far uh do you\n[180.6s] have a series that is still remaining or\n[182.7s] a topic that is still remaining that you\n[184.7s] need to handle maybe coming days? Yeah.\n[187.4s] uh we only have I only have one class\n[189.4s] remaining that class is tomorrow and I\n[192.4s] will be able to clarify everything and\n[194.2s] bring it to summary that the topic of\n[196.9s] tomorrow is that a youth must now decide\n[198.7s] for themselves. All right that is very\n[201.0s] powerful. So uh beloved we've been uh\n[204.6s] having that powerful topic and we came\n[207.4s] to the realization that uh this is the\n[210.5s] third angel's message and in rejecting\n[214.3s] this truth that God is giving to his\n[216.7s] church. It is like rejecting the entire\n[220.2s] message that Adventism have. Yeah, that\n[222.4s] is true that education was we realized\n[226.2s] that the birthight of reformation. We\n[228.6s] realize that the plan of redemption is\n[230.5s] the dem of the Bible. Education is\n[233.4s] redemption. And therefore, if someone\n[235.1s] rejects the education, such a person has\n[238.0s] rejected the whole Bible. Oh, so no one\n[241.3s] is going to go to heaven without being\n[243.2s] educated because heaven is a school. Oh,\n[245.4s] it is just promotion over the next\n[247.7s] class. That is so powerful. So the theme\n[250.2s] the central theme of the scripture is is\n[254.7s] redemption or salvation and we said that\n[258.3s] education and salvation is more or less\n[261.1s] the same. They are inseparable. You\n[263.3s] cannot separate education and\n[266.2s] redemption. In other words in the\n[268.1s] highest sense education and redemption\n[270.6s] are one. For as in education so is in\n[273.8s] redemption. So it means that the central\n[276.5s] theme of the scripture is education.\n[278.7s] That is that is in other words. So thank\n[280.6s] you. Thank you so much um um to Mishnik.\n[283.4s] I think that is very powerful and uh the\n[286.5s] viewers can actually get it in that\n[289.0s] deeper sense and I know that God is\n[291.1s] going to help us. Sure. So uh viewers\n[293.8s] what we are saying about education here\n[296.6s] we have series of studies that are\n[299.3s] presented in our playlist down there.\n[302.0s] You can actually get the link in our\n[304.4s] description. So just go and view all\n[307.8s] those uh presentations concerning\n[310.1s] education because it is that powerful\n[313.3s] one. So maybe uh um to Mr. Jeff. Yes.\n[316.7s] You can tell us maybe uh uh the response\n[321.0s] are you can you you can see from uh\n[323.6s] those whom you are handling in class\n[325.4s] what is are you seeing members and are\n[328.6s] understanding this message or it is what\n[331.8s] can you tell us? Thank you for that\n[333.4s] question but I know that uh when a\n[335.8s] meeting is made like this people should\n[337.8s] not just come to the meeting and go back\n[339.5s] home with an an empty mind and therefore\n[342.9s] as a teacher we need to be we need to\n[345.8s] understand or we need to engage all the\n[348.4s] delegates so that you be sure that\n[350.2s] whatever you are teaching or the\n[351.3s] whatever you are presenting must be\n[353.3s] understood by all the delegates and at\n[355.2s] the same time we know and understand\n[356.6s] that all things who are taken to the\n[358.2s] YouTube we are sure that the viewers who\n[360.6s] are going to view our channel will be\n[362.2s] able\n[363.8s] But for\n[364.8s] now that we had the series of studies\n[367.5s] that we had as well assure you that the\n[371.0s] delegates are able to understand and you\n[373.0s] see when you make a call and you see\n[374.5s] people make a step of of joining the to\n[377.6s] be prayed for it is very sure that those\n[380.5s] people are understanding what is being\n[382.1s] taught. Therefore in the classes of\n[383.8s] education I saw people getting to\n[386.4s] understand what redemption is because\n[388.1s] all of us we are deciding to be set to\n[391.0s] be saved. No one will not desire not to\n[394.0s] be saved to be saved because what we\n[395.8s] want is redemption. That's the central\n[397.6s] theme what is to be preached and\n[399.1s] therefore people must understand the\n[400.3s] plan of redemption and I saw that they\n[402.2s] were able to understand it. Oh all right\n[404.3s] thank you. Thank you uh evangelist\n[407.1s] Jeffnik. So uh our\n[410.0s] viewers I would like to inform you that\n[412.4s] this is just one of the speakers of this\n[416.8s] convention and uh he has played a key\n[419.6s] role uh by giving us the topic about the\n[424.5s] true education and I know that this is\n[427.6s] one of the subjects that is bringing\n[429.9s] contention among the reformers among the\n[433.7s] children even of the world. So uh I\n[437.1s] would wish that uh may God help us and\n[441.0s] uh if you want to learn more as I've\n[442.6s] said just go back to our the description\n[445.8s] down there I'm going I'm going to put a\n[447.5s] link that is going to direct you to all\n[449.8s] those series about education. Now to\n[452.8s] bring this to a close uh uh um to Mishi.\n[455.7s] Yes. Uh we have uh many people who are\n[461.2s] are still not having the depth\n[463.6s] understanding when it comes to\n[465.2s] education. So maybe what can you tell\n[468.4s] them where where did you get all these\n[470.6s] informations from so that their minds\n[473.0s] may be directed well to get the right\n[476.1s] understanding as you do? What can you\n[478.0s] tell them? Where is the where do we get\n[479.9s] all these truths from or where did you\n[482.6s] learn all these truths about education?\n[485.1s] Thank you for that. One of the thing\n[487.0s] that I will desire to tell the viewers\n[489.9s] that if we don't understand what\n[492.2s] education is in other words we cannot\n[494.5s] get you cannot be redeemed. In other\n[497.1s] words, you cannot be saved without\n[498.7s] education. And therefore it comes to a\n[501.4s] personal\n[503.0s] uh responsibility to everyone that\n[505.7s] everyone who desiring for eternal life\n[507.8s] must strive to understand the true\n[511.1s] science of what? Education. And\n[512.8s] therefore like we said as we beginning\n[514.9s] that the central theme of the Bible is\n[517.4s] educate education. One of our things\n[519.3s] that we need to understand that the\n[520.9s] Bible will always en line 10 human mind\n[524.6s] on every point of doctrine in everything\n[527.1s] because the book that is 2 Timothy 3:16\n[530.9s] says that all things in the scriptures\n[533.0s] are there to train us so that we might\n[535.0s] be good people and therefore one of the\n[537.7s] sources of the truth that is going to\n[541.0s] sanctify the soul and lead to the\n[543.5s] perfect redemption are in the in the\n[546.1s] Bible that is why we are always being\n[548.3s] admonished that we need to study the\n[549.8s] Bible daily. Amen. And therefore, us\n[552.6s] being an Adventist, another source of\n[554.9s] our truth, we know as Adventist that our\n[556.9s] creed is the the Bible. We realize that\n[559.7s] God gave the church the gift of the\n[562.0s] spirit of what? Prophecy. And therefore,\n[564.2s] there's also another source of light\n[566.0s] that is the spirit of through prophecy.\n[568.0s] And we believe that the spirit of\n[569.4s] prophecy is manifested in the writings\n[571.7s] of Ellen Ellen White. And Ellen White is\n[573.9s] also speaking that let the dead speak,\n[576.6s] the dead speak. M says that the dead\n[579.8s] speak for people of God living in the\n[582.2s] last days we need to understand what the\n[585.3s] servant of God meaning because the dead\n[587.4s] cannot do what cannot speak and\n[589.0s] therefore she explains that can only\n[591.0s] speak through their what their writings\n[592.7s] and she says we need to study the\n[594.9s] writings of pioneers pioneers like Jones\n[600.0s] Stephankell log James\n[603.2s] White we need to study their work their\n[605.9s] work I tell that Stephan was explaining\n[609.8s] the book of Daniel chapter 4. You go to\n[612.2s] expl when he explains Daniel chapter 11,\n[614.5s] the whole theme of Daniel chapter 4 and\n[616.2s] Daniel chapter 11 is always that system\n[619.5s] of educ education and is trying to tell\n[621.8s] us that we need to have an education\n[624.1s] education that is higher than the even\n[627.1s] education the universities of the the\n[629.2s] world because that is the only education\n[630.6s] that is going to be accepted in heaven.\n[633.4s] Let me assure the viewers that the\n[634.9s] education can only be obtained in the\n[636.7s] schools of the pro the prophets prophets\n[638.5s] and therefore God is calling us to be\n[641.2s] men who are going to study the\n[642.4s] scriptures and the spirit of prophecy\n[644.3s] enlightening the truth in Jesus name. Oh\n[647.0s] thank you thank you to me. Uh there is\n[649.8s] this book that uh you've used so much\n[653.2s] written by someone like uh stherlands.\n[655.8s] Yeah. Uh what is the title of that book?\n[658.0s] The title of that book is uh studies on\n[660.9s] Christian education. studies on\n[663.2s] Christian education. Can you recommend\n[664.8s] it to the viewers because it is such a\n[667.2s] powerful book when it comes to\n[669.1s] education. Thank you for that. I'll\n[672.2s] recommend it to the viewers. Number one,\n[674.2s] we need to understand that\n[675.7s] Southerntherlands was a principle, a\n[678.6s] teacher in the Madison school. Madison\n[681.8s] school is a school that was established\n[683.4s] by the seventh adventist and therefore\n[686.0s] he explains and I let me just give them\n[689.4s] a brief overview of what is in the book.\n[691.7s] If you want to know the history of 1844,\n[693.7s] what happened to the remuneration of\n[695.4s] 1844, the best book to study is studies\n[698.5s] on Christian education by Netherlands.\n[700.7s] And therefore, children of God who are\n[703.0s] listening to me, what you need to\n[704.2s] understand that each one of us needs to\n[706.7s] get that book to study it deeply and\n[709.5s] therefore those things that happened to\n[711.4s] each movement happened unto them for our\n[715.2s] examples that we seventh day Adventists\n[717.0s] who are living in the last days need to\n[718.7s] understand our position as a people.\n[720.8s] spoken. Amen. Thank you. Thank you,\n[722.6s] Mishi. That is powerful. So, uh viewers,\n[725.4s] there is a book called studies on\n[727.4s] Christian education written by one who\n[730.4s] is speaking at a point of information\n[732.4s] that is southerntherlands. So, in the\n[734.6s] description go down there uh I've\n[736.7s] attached the link to the book and uh I\n[739.9s] know that it is going to be a great\n[741.8s] blessing. He was one of the principles\n[744.6s] in Madison school and we know that\n[746.6s] Madison school is the blueprint where we\n[749.3s] can find the blueprint of true\n[751.0s] education. So I I hope you are blessed\n[753.6s] and uh maybe uh um Tumishi. Yes. Uh\n[757.1s] maybe as we bring this to a close you\n[759.2s] can uh give us maybe your last remarks.\n[762.7s] uh you can give the viewers your last\n[764.4s] remark just just in a in a nutshell or\n[766.2s] in a in a short way so that uh the\n[768.9s] viewers can uh can actually know that uh\n[774.2s] uh the\n[775.2s] ministry is doing much and uh there are\n[779.3s] a lot of people that actually they don't\n[782.2s] understand these truths. So what can you\n[785.1s] maybe as you give your close remarks\n[787.4s] what can you tell us? What I can tell\n[789.9s] the viewers is that uh now as never\n[792.3s] before we need to understand the two\n[794.3s] science of education. If we fail to\n[796.5s] understand this we shall not have a\n[799.4s] place in the kingdom of god of of god.\n[801.6s] Therefore let's try let's get connected\n[804.5s] to the ministry through our media so\n[807.0s] that we need to we we we understand the\n[809.7s] true science of education and that is\n[812.2s] eternal life. All right. Amen. Thank\n[814.2s] you. So\n[815.2s] uh thank you so much for uh watching up\n[818.7s] to this far and uh I know it has been a\n[822.2s] blessing. It has been uh an insightful\n[825.6s] discussion and we still ask for your\n[828.5s] support. uh those who love the truth, we\n[830.6s] still ask of your support because uh the\n[833.6s] other day we were having a brother from\n[836.0s] SIA and uh he really wish that the truth\n[838.9s] to reach the home and you saw that one\n[841.3s] of the truth that he rejoiced in is the\n[844.1s] true education. The other day we are\n[846.7s] also also having a sister called Jalenza\n[849.4s] from Karungu. She also rejoiced in the\n[853.4s] message of the true education.

        "full_transcript": "lesson on drugs. I will just like us to read something here that we never read last time that also was still commenting on drugs because today many people we learn that many people have been sick and they are not getting the right treatment that they should have. So today I want us also to look in this part. Just recently we had that help from America. The American World Health Organization will not be issuing drugs to Africa. Now this took many with worry as now many people who are suffering from HIV AIDS, malaria, TB among many other diseases will not now be receiving this drugs and many people were worried that with the situation. Uh Kenyans faces HIV treatment crisis as only 6 months supply of ARV drugs remaining. So many people have been worried that when there is no supply of these drugs, what is the way forward or what is the solution? We've learned that we have reached at a time that we are going to preach these messages so that people might understand that there is hope when we believe in Christ. uh and many people were worrying how were they going to help themselves. So we are being told that the medical fraternity that is from the book 16 MR just as I want to connect my lesson from the point I left under the drugs right len white writes that the medical fraternity represented me as freeman. So we can just highlight that book and note it down that medical fraternity of the world it is freemanor. If we look the logo of health organization, which logo is that? It is over snail. That means that is what a free man. It continuates the medical fraternity presented to me as freman sorry with their long unintelligible names which common people cannot understand. The drugs are having some names that common people cannot watch cannot understand. For example, who can understand what is omerazol? Omethrosol is a drug that is used in the cases of alers. Who can understand what is omerazol and how it is being made? We see we cannot understand and we don't know what are the uh components that are being used to make that drug. For example, flagagile. So they are names even doctor themselves cannot understand what they are administering to the people. So what we must understand that this is a witchcraft and a sorcery that Satan has brought so many people might die at earlier age. It continue readings cannot understand will call the Lord's prescription for Ezekiel quackery. Death was pronounced upon the king but he prayed for life and his prayer was heard. Those who are the care of him were told to get a bunch of figs and put them on so and the king was restored. This means was taken by God to teach them. So in the Bible traces we are not finding any place that drugs are are recommended for human treatment. So what we must understand that we are living at a time that Satan has studied the science of the laboratories and now what Satan is going to do is going to bring and advertise more chemicals. I would like us also to read from the book of great controversy page 559 paragraph 2 and we we see the plan of Satan with the drug medication because even now as the plans of Jesuit disorder if you go through them they say that they will use drugs so that they kill people slowly. What we understand with the drug will not kill someone within a day but it is slow and sure killing to the system. So can we be there? Satan works through the elements also to Ghana service of unprepared souls. He has studied the secrets of the laboratories of nature. Now being that Satan is a student of true education, he has studied the laboratories of nature. He know the med the remedy that can help man. But having the knowledge that he can also make chemicals, he have used it more than required and he uses all his power to control the element as far as God allows. So in these last days, Satan is controlling the laboratories because Satan is having an agree project to the world under medical treatment. So many people think that when they go to the hospital it is uh it is that they think that doctors love them that somehow some you will find some people saving a number of doctor a doctor saying Dr. who and who he has been helping me. You can also have his number. No, doctors are not our friends. But they don't love us but they love our money. Because we know and understand that the project of medicine, it is the expensive business under the world. Why? Because drugs that are being issued and ministered to the people, they do not cure diseases. Now they will make you into in a continual way that you will you use them daily as Elder said that it is a fact and true that it is a business. So it continues saying he will favor and prosper some in order to further his own designs and he will bring trouble upon others and lead and lead men to believe that that it is God who is afflicting them. Now we understand and as we just read that this business that is being conducted by Satan himself through the many people or through a name called medicine medicine we know that this is the sorcery of the papacy. These are the plans of the papacy that they may destroy people and kill people in an earlier age so that people do not make decisions. In the book of Revelation chapter 18 verse 23, can someone read? It says shall no more. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Shall be heard no more. Uhhuh. Uh-huh. For thy merchants were the great men of the earth today. Who are the great men of the earth? the merchants, the businessmen. But what are they selling to the people? Things that harm the system and things that kill people's law. But sure, continue reading. For by thy sorceries today, the only is deceived because the sorcery of the great men who are deceiving people. So sorcery is full everywhere. Today even food many foods that are being made. For example, today we have plastic cabbages, we have plastic rice. These are sorceries that are killing people slowly by slowly. So that what I wanted to understand that the project of medicine it is a project of Satan himself because it is a sorcery and it is a a witchcraft. Just Ellen White as he was shown he have told us that medical fraternity is what a free m. So what are the freemasons and what are their aims? If drug if the drug uh the drug itself uh the drug company is being supported with free mans what is the aim to destroy. So today I would like us to enter into the solution because we were looking way forward. We have learned that the drug is not the way. So today I would like us to look some remedies that is going to help our system and uh this is the point that we stopped at last time. Someone can echo it again from the book of Jeremiah 8 verse 21. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Mhm. Uhhuh. Why God is that? Because of the kind of treatment and medication that people are pursuing from Satan himself. Verse 22. It says, \"If there are no is there no bulb in Gilead?\" Is there no bulb in Gilead? is no is there no physician there? And that is the question that we asked last time that is there no physician in the places we live. Is there no B the world we are living? But we need to answer that there is B and thereians because God has called us to be what? to be medical missionaries who are going to understand the cause of diseases and the medication itself. Let us move forward. The book of U PH this is 14 sorry for 1144 8.1 I'm just missing for there that reads the the simple remedies are less harmful than drug poisons in reion to their simplicity but in every many cases these are used when not at all necessary. The next paragraph, there are simple herbs and roots that every family may use for themselves. So, every family to use what? Herbs. We are being told that every family to use what? Herbs. Because Mhm. Continue reading. Simple. They are simple herbs. Pick themselves call in a physician. Uhhuh. any sooner than they will call a lawyer. So there are there are many harms and even roots that can help so that people might not be calling physician each and every time. Today why many people are calling physicians because they do not understand how the system how the body system works. So if you understand how our body system works, we are not going to call manians because we have hs everywhere. We have roots everywhere. Mhm. The book of CME 29 paragraph 4. You can also note that one. And we see the need of workers today because after learning that the drugs are no solution to our life, we need now to go to the chief physician who is Christ. Even Christ never administered drugs to the patients he attended to. But also Christ gave them the natural way that God has commanded. It reads workers workers gospel uh gospel medical missionaries are needed now. When are the gospel uh when are the workers gospel missionaries needed? Now it is now. Continue. You cannot afford to spend years in preparation. We can just not say that we are year after year we are still preparing to do the work. Soon doors now open. Soon doors now open. Soon doors now open. The truth will be forever closed to the truth will be forever closed. Carry the message now. Carry the message now. Not wait. And not wait. Allow the Do not wait. Allow the enemy to take possession Uhhuh. of the fields now open before you. Continue reading. Let compassy go forth to do the work to which Christ appointed his disciples let them labor as evangelists. Let us now labor as evangelists. Scattering our publications. scattering our publications and talking of the truth to those they meet. Let them pray for the sick. Let them pray for the sick. Ministering to their necessities. Uh-huh. Not with drugs. Not with drugs. Not with drugs. Uhhuh. But with nature's remedies. But with nature's remedy and teaching them how to regain health and teaching now people how to regain health and avoid disease. And avoid disease. So today we are being called as evangelist. We are being called as medical missionary to scatter the publication that carries the old truth that we proclaim. Because sometimes in the message will not be some people may not have heard the message but through our publications we will write and we will publish and people might know what they must what they must believe or what they must trust including the first annual message. The second, the third because in the third message it carry the various messages that is the book CME page 29 paragraph 4. Then 90 then ministry of billing page 147 90 page sorry 90 page 172 paragraph 4. It reads that let them labor as evangelists scattering our publication and taking and talking of the truth to those they meet. Let them pray for the sick, ministering to their necessities, not with drugs, but with nature's remedy and teaching them how to regain health and avoid diseases. And that is the responsibility that Christ has given us so that we may labor much that people may live in a way that they cannot be affected by diseases and give them the the present truth. Also the book of medical the book of ministry of healing page 146 paragraph 1 it reads it reads all gospel workers all gospel workers should know how to give the simple treatments all all all yes to mean all if you are a gospel worker you you are not a medical missionary are you fulfilling the law that are you fulfilling the work that Christ gave but you are being told that all workers whether you are young or old we should have a knowledge on how to give what simple treatments because we have several simple treatments for example we have hydrotherapy those are the kinds of simple treatments that we can have we have physiootherapy the massage those are the kind of simple treatments that each and every one of us have to know. So make sure that after coming from this place as a gospel worker, you have a eat of giving simple treatments that do so much to relieve pain and remove disease because soon as we have been told that the work of gospel work may is going to be closed. But if we have knowledge on how to give simple treatments that do so much to relieve pain and remove diseases many many doors are going to be open. Just continue reading with the next paragraph there. Every disease every every gospel worker every gospel worker will feel that the giving of instruction uh in the principles of healthful living uh is a part his appoint is is a part of his appointed work. So we have today many ministers who are saying that with me I'm not a medical missionary I'm just I'm I'm just interested in other part but we are being told that every gospel worker should feel that the giving of instruction the principle of healthful living is a is a part of it appointed work. So each and every individual has what? Something to do something to do. We cannot just relax that we have the the medical missionary department. The medical missionary department is not for what individual person but it's a call to everyone that they should feel and understand the responsibility that Christ has given them. Continue reading it of this work. Uhhuh. There's a great need. There is a great need and the world is open for it today. Every place there is there is no one who is going to reject the work of medical missionary because everywhere people are sick. Everywhere people need the true treating of the true method of treating the body. That's we have read from the book ministry of healing page 147. You can also write it down. So we understand that each and every person as an individual work to have the knowledge in simple treatment of disease and relieving pain and even removing the disease. But as you have learned the last time that removing disease we must understand the cause and the cause must be what? The cause must be agent. If we understand that method, that true method of healing, we are going to help many and we are going to bring many people to Christ. So this is the method and the way that Christ has gave that as he sent his disciples to be missionaries who will understand the necessities of giving the right principles of health to people who need Christ. Today in the book of um PH PH 1448 paragraph 3. It reads it says it says I do not think that I can give you any definite line of medicine compounded and and dealt out by doctors that are harm that are perfectly harmless. Uh-huh. And yet and yet it will not be wisdom to engage in controversy. Mhm. Over this subject just leave from that point. I think we have written it down. We will you will still read it later because of time. Let me go to another one another quote. That one we have look. So after having learned that we want to look various simple remedies that is going to help us because we say that our food should be what? Our should our food should be our medicine but we should not take medic we should not take medicine as what? As food. So we want to look various remedies that today we have prepared so that we might understand the time we are living. We read that one last time. I will not read it again. Now we will read from the book medical missionary page 320 paragraph 2 and paragraph 3. It says it says learn how to combat disease. Now that is the major point that you need to understand from out from this place that you you should know how to combat what disease. Know how to combat what? Disease. Continue. Gather up all the knowledge possible that will help to combat disease. So it is still your work to do what? To gather all knowledge possible that will help to combat disease. How are you going to gather this knowledge? It is through reading various of what books that are teaching about health and our hearts. It says it says in every place in every place the sick may be found. The sick may be found and those who go forth as workers for Christ those who go forth as workers of Christ should be true health reformers should be true health reformers prepare to give those who are seek the simple treatment that will relieve them and then pray with them. Yeah. Thus they will open the door for the entrance of the truth. Uhhuh. The doing of this work will be followed by good result. Uh-huh. Our Sabbath keeping families should keep their mind filled with helpful principles of health reform and other lines of truth that they may be a help to their neighbors. Amen. Be practical missionaries. So what is needed for us now the time of living that we be what? Practical missionaries. Practical missionaries. Gather up all knowledge possible that will help to combat disease. Amen. This just that point also read HL page 19 paragraph 5 HL. It is the duty of every person to become intelligent in regard to disease and it causes. So we have a work to do to become intelligent in regard to disease and it causes and that is the great work that each and every person need to do. Mhm. Yeah, just again in the book of WM page 127 paragraph one it says it says God's people God's people should know how to give the simple treatments Uhhuh. that do much to relieve pain. Uhhuh. And to remove diseases and to remove disaseshu eggs and pains Uhhuh. have left you without the use of medicine. What is the definition of disease? What is the definition of disease? Disease is an effort of nature to free the system from conditions. Mhm. That result from a violation of the laws of health. So I think that foundation that I have built, it is enough for us to have knowledge in combating diseases and even relieving pain in using some simple remedies. And now one of the simple remedies that we will like and start off is some of kind of foods is kind of food that many people know and many people use. So the best natural remedies that we should know it is keeping the commandments of God and eight laws of health. Why? Because number one, we understand that if we go against law number four that speak about water and we if we go against law number four, we know very well that a lot of water is required into the system. Number one, who knows the work of the water in the system into the system. Number one, we have various work of water in the body. Number one, gas exchange. Number two, uh, number three, we don't know the uses of water in the body. Digestion. What helps to cool the system? Digestion. Digestion. Another one. What about the body? Even transportation. Even transportation. Uh-huh. What about the engine? How many percentage is required? The brain is the engine of the body. So we must understand that the brain is the what? Is the engine of the body. It controls the whole system. How you speak, how you talk, how you laugh, how you walk. It's the brain. It's the what? The brain. And we understand the various work of parts of the brain. So I will not go into details to bring anatomy. But I would just like us to take us through this natural remedies. And the best natural simple treatment is by what? Water. Water is everywhere. And if we use water wisely, many people are not going to get sick. Today many people don't know how much water they should drink a day. How many waters should a person weigh 60 kg drink? How can you understand? How can you know the the water that you should take a day? By doing what? By doing calculation. So I never put it there but we we uh there is the mathematics here that if 1 kilogram is assumed to take 50 ml of water. Therefore, 60 kilm will take how much water? And we understand that 1,00 ml is equal to how many lit? One lit. So, can you calculate 60 * 50 / 1,00 that is 3,00 1,000 is how many lit? 3 L. So if you are 60 kilg how many how much water should you take? It is 3 lit because if 1 kilogram is assumed to be 50 ml. Therefore if you are 50 how many will be that is 50 * 50 that is 2500ide by 1,000 it is 2.5. So calculate and you know you have kilograms and you calculate. What about BMI? BMI. How can we calculate the BMI? It is what to do BMI body mass index. How to know whether you have a lot of cholesterols or you you you fall under normal range because normal range of BMI is 18.5 to 24.9. So if you are below 18.5 gi your you are not you don't have normal BMI. So you need to calculate that one. It is weight. I think it is weight over square or height square over weight. It is weight. Let assume someone is 1.7 cm. You square 1.7 cm. Then you divide with 60 kg 1.7 60 kg let us just do very fast 60 / 1.7 squared no m sorry it is 1 7 m it is no cm Sorry, it is you need to call to time please. It is what? 60 / 1.7 2 1 1.7 * 1.7 you get the answer. Then 10. It seems like some of us never took maths. 2.89 by 60. Yeah. 20.76. So if if such a person was having such height and weight 20.6 that range under normal BMI because it range from 18.5 to 24.9 that is the range of under normal BMI. So if you are above or below the intake of fats should be reduced. But we understand that there are natural fats in the body and now if only we only if people like taking the deep fried foods animal products uh it will bring such a range of high. Let us be back here. The next lesson we will handle water in details how we can use water to cure all the diseases in the body. We have theapy and idotherapy we have steam baths. We have hot food bath. We have hot fermentation among others that we will look into details because those are the kind of simple remedies that are around. Timekeeper will be alerting me if remains 30 minutes. So don't forget to do that. So we have number one we have cabbage. Now these are the simple remedies that we have around. Number one is cabbage. So if you can get a place or somewhere you are writing you can this you can write the benefits of the cabbage. And now what we must understand that fruits, salads and juices those are the best remedies that helps to cleanse the system and even to strengthen the cells of the body. So number one we must understand that juice juices and salad foods are required in the body because they help in removing toxins and even rebuilding some cells which have been destroyed. So number one we have cabbage. I think we can see it there clearly and we have benefits of the cabbage. Number one controls blood pressure. Number two, protects bones from weakening. Number three, promotes good eye health. For those who are having eye problems, they need to fade in mostly in cabbage juices. Sometimes cabbage is sometimes being overcooked until the nutrients required now are not present present. Number three or number four help in weight loss for those who have BMI above 24.9 going upwards. Uh-huh. Number the next is detoxify the body. It removes the toxin from the bodys as blood sugar regulator. Those who are suffering from diabetes, it can help reduces the risk of having ulcer. It is the best remedy by the way for dealing with cancer. We you can make a juice from it. You can make a salad from it. It prevent pimples relieves in constipation. That is a problem someone can have even in a period or in a time that if we don't take a lot of water into the system sometimes we can have constipation improve digestion okay digestion then the next one which is here which is not there it helps in arthritis you can write down I hope you are writing because we have learned that from this place we need to be gospel workers as who know how to combat disease, who know how to prevent disease. So if we will be mentioning and you are not writing sometimes I will be wondering if you will take note later. Uhhuh. Then another one also it it helps in inflammations. For example, we will have a pis from this one and you you can just mash it in hot water. Then you tie it in a inflamed area. We have various inflammation. Inflammation can be in the hands. Inflammation can be in the various parts of the body. Do we understand that if there inflammations in the body, it means there is no better circulation of the blood into the system. Again, it I've said that it helps in the inflammation or inflammatory. It also helps when you are bited with by insects. Insects such as bees, we have worms, wasp among others which is a good remedy for that arthritis. It will deal it will help inflammations among others. You will also add more many more on that. Let us go to let us look another one. This is onion. I hope we understand onion and we know onion very well. Uh onion is one of the one of the medicines that is being that is being used to help in various diseases. We have number one in that other side. Fight cancer, promote respiratory health. If you have asthma, we have various diseases in the respiratory system. It will help low blood sugar levels, enhance eye. It is the best remedy also to use when someone is having an eye problem. You can make a soup from it or you can make a pies from it. And then you tie to the eyes onions and hair growth. It helps in hair growth. It adds some elements that helps in the hair growth. And number one elements that help in the air growth is zinc. So it does it contain various elements such as zinc that also have to maintain black hair and to have good health growth and has brain health. It also helps the brain, prevents inflammation and other allergies. Those who are suffering and having difficulties with allergy, it helps. Rich in antioxidant compounds, contain anti-cancer compounds are antibacterial. There are various bacteria that can affect the body. For example, we have elictor H. pylori which sometimes causes also the ulcers itself. It helps in that we have various bacteras, we have various viruses, we have various what may support heart health, may support bone health to those people who sometimes complain of their bones. It helps it contain also magnesium and calcium because element which is magnesium and calcium they are helping making strong bones. They supply the necessities that are required by wounds to help may support your gut health may regulate blood pressure respiratory system because of time allow me to go a bit faster. Kidogo I use I give the remaining 20 minutes to the class. Okay. at your also on time you can come and have this presentation and you can inquire more books containing the same remedies because sometimes time will not allow us to look them all in details but we will still see on how we will have knowledge on them here we have a spinach how many people know spinach I think we all know spinach very well it helps in preventing cancer keep us relaxed keep our hair nails and skin healthy help us maintain healthy body weight. Rich in protein. If you want protein, obtain it from spinach. Obtain it from nuts. Rich in vitamin C. We know the work of vitamin C. Help us build strong bones. There are some people still complain of the bones. They can feed on stomach. The best is having it as a help us build strong bones. improve digestion, gut health, good for our eyes. It is also a good remedy for eye because it contain vitamin A, regulate blood sugar. These are the same also other uses, boost immunity. Mhm. Helps also the brain, prevent anemia problems. Those who are having anemia, it contains a lot of ions that helps in the blood formation so that your body have the maximum required blood to perform the duties of the system. We have banana. Health benefits of eating a banana. Improve digestion. Improve heart health. Boost energy. Reduce inflammation. Enhance mood. Strengthen the bones. Improve kidney function. Those are the benefits of eating bananas. So we need to take fruits. We need to take nuts and cereals among others that are required in the body. We must understand that if we don't take balanced diet, our body will not get the elements because the elements are very important in the body. Magnesium, calcium, ion, phosphorus, chlorine, they have different bodies. They have different works in the body. So if we don't take in the the body, you will still hear many people complaining because we don't take we don't feed in a balanced diet that we are going to get all these elements all these minerals and all these nutrients that help to build the body. We have watermelon to those who don't doesn't like drinking water. Watermelon also help because it is water than me. So it have a lot of water. Promote heart health. Strengthen the immune system. Improve male fertility. Aids in diabetes treatment. Improve brain health. Enhance digestive health. strengthen hair, improve skin health, slow down aging. Let us look at this one also. This is cayenne pepper and also cayenne pepper. It is the one of the major painillers that is used. Number one, improve circulation. More so when someone is tired it means there is no full circulation in the system. But if you drink if you you drink cayenne if you you it is being used also in the massage to increase the flow of the blood into the system. Uh treat stomach ulcers lower blood pressure. Relieve constipation. Kill garden pest detoxification. Fight cold and flu. Lower blood pressure. Heart conditions. Prevent heart attack. Sen relieve digestive aid. Relieve pain. Toothachenitis wounds fever weight loss headaches congestion. So those are the among the benefits of using these kinds of remedies. Now there is a major remedy here called grapes. In our next lesson we will also look gra in details because grapes it is almost containing all these elements. I can see it has water, energy, protein, carbohydrates, fiber, sugar, calcium, lipids, magnesium, phosphorus among many others. So it is a very good remedy to use to be used while revitalizing the body. When someone the best remedies will the best remedy will be grapes. We will see what we can mix with it to help the body provide to provide the body with the required element. Grapes is a best remedy when using with someone. This one will help him to regain energy faster because it contains all these elements that the body required even that the immune system is required also to rejuvenate the white blood cells.

I will just like us to\n[5.2s] read something here that we never read\n[7.8s] last time that also was still commenting\n[11.0s] on drugs because today many people we\n[15.2s] learn that many people have been sick\n[19.0s] and they are not getting the right\n[21.5s] treatment that they should have. So\n[25.0s] today I want us also to look in this\n[28.3s] part. Just recently we\n[31.6s] had\n[33.7s] that help from America. The\n[38.0s] American World Health Organization will\n[41.4s] not be issuing drugs to Africa. Now this\n[45.7s] took many with worry as now many people\n[49.6s] who are suffering from HIV\n[51.5s] AIDS, malaria, TB among many other\n[55.2s] diseases will not now be receiving this\n[58.1s] drugs and many people were worried that\n[61.2s] with the situation. Uh Kenyans faces HIV\n[64.4s] treatment crisis as only 6 months supply\n[66.8s] of ARV drugs remaining. So many people\n[71.2s] have been worried that when there is no\n[73.8s] supply of these drugs, what is the way\n[77.1s] forward or what is the solution? We've\n[79.6s] learned that we have reached at a time\n[81.5s] that we are going to preach these\n[83.4s] messages so that people might understand\n[85.8s] that there is hope when we believe in\n[88.5s] Christ.\n[94.3s] uh and many people were worrying how\n[97.2s] were they going to help themselves.\n[100.5s] So we are being told that the medical\n[104.0s] fraternity that is from the book 16 MR\n[107.6s] just as I want to connect my lesson from\n[110.1s] the point I left under the\n[112.9s] drugs right len white writes that the\n[116.2s] medical fraternity represented me as\n[119.4s] freeman. So we can just highlight that\n[122.0s] book and note it down that medical\n[125.0s] fraternity of the world it is freemanor.\n[129.4s] If we look the logo of health\n[133.2s] organization, which logo is that? It is\n[136.5s] over\n[140.1s] snail. That means that is what a free\n[143.6s] man. It\n[146.0s] continuates the medical fraternity\n[148.4s] presented to me as freman\n[151.3s] sorry with their long\n[154.1s] unintelligible names which common people\n[157.0s] cannot understand. The drugs are having\n[159.8s] some names that common people cannot\n[162.9s] watch cannot understand. For example,\n[166.4s] who can understand what is omerazol?\n[169.0s] Omethrosol is a drug that is used in the\n[171.9s] cases of alers. Who can understand what\n[174.6s] is\n[175.3s] omerazol and how it is being\n[178.9s] made? We see we cannot understand and we\n[181.7s] don't know what are the uh components\n[184.3s] that are being used to make that drug.\n[187.0s] For example, flagagile. So they are\n[190.6s] names even doctor themselves cannot\n[193.3s] understand what they are administering\n[195.6s] to the people. So what we must\n[197.9s] understand that this is a witchcraft and\n[200.9s] a sorcery that Satan has brought so many\n[204.6s] people might die at earlier age. It\n[208.4s] continue\n[209.7s] readings cannot understand will call the\n[212.5s] Lord's prescription for Ezekiel\n[216.8s] quackery. Death was pronounced upon the\n[219.3s] king but he prayed for life and his\n[222.3s] prayer was heard. Those who are the care\n[225.3s] of him were told to get a bunch of figs\n[228.6s] and put them on so and the king was\n[231.2s] restored. This means was taken by God to\n[234.2s] teach them. So in the Bible traces we\n[237.9s] are not finding any place that drugs are\n[241.6s] are recommended for human treatment. So\n[245.4s] what we must understand that we are\n[247.5s] living at a time that Satan has studied\n[250.6s] the science of the laboratories and now\n[254.8s] what Satan is going to do is going to\n[257.5s] bring and advertise more chemicals. I\n[260.6s] would like us also to read from the book\n[262.2s] of great controversy page 559 paragraph\n[266.3s] 2 and we we see the plan of Satan with\n[270.1s] the drug medication because even now as\n[273.0s] the plans of Jesuit disorder if you go\n[275.4s] through them they say that they will use\n[278.5s] drugs so that they kill people slowly.\n[281.4s] What we understand with the\n[283.1s] drug will not kill someone within a day\n[286.2s] but it is slow and sure killing to the\n[288.9s] system. So can we be\n[291.2s] there? Satan works through the elements\n[294.6s] also to Ghana service of unprepared\n[297.1s] souls. He has studied the secrets of the\n[300.0s] laboratories of nature. Now being that\n[302.7s] Satan is a student of true education, he\n[305.1s] has studied the laboratories of nature.\n[308.3s] He know the med the remedy that can help\n[312.2s] man. But having the knowledge that he\n[315.0s] can also make chemicals, he have used it\n[318.4s] more than required and he uses all his\n[321.7s] power to control the element as far as\n[325.4s] God allows. So in these last days, Satan\n[328.6s] is controlling the laboratories because\n[331.4s] Satan is having an agree project to the\n[334.2s] world under medical treatment. So many\n[338.7s] people think that when they go to the\n[342.0s] hospital it is uh it is that they think\n[345.5s] that doctors love them that somehow some\n[348.6s] you will find some people saving a\n[351.1s] number of doctor a doctor saying Dr. who\n[354.2s] and who he has been helping me. You can\n[356.9s] also have his number. No, doctors are\n[359.2s] not our friends. But they don't love us\n[361.8s] but they love our money. Because we know\n[364.0s] and understand that the project of\n[366.6s] medicine, it is the expensive business\n[369.5s] under the world. Why? Because drugs that\n[372.6s] are being issued and ministered to the\n[374.5s] people, they do not cure diseases. Now\n[377.5s] they will make you into in a continual\n[380.1s] way that you will you use them daily as\n[384.4s] Elder said that it is a fact and true\n[388.0s] that it is a\n[392.0s] business. So it continues\n[395.6s] saying he will favor and prosper some in\n[399.3s] order to further his own designs and he\n[401.8s] will bring trouble upon others and lead\n[404.6s] and lead men to believe that that it is\n[407.8s] God who is afflicting them.\n[412.6s] Now we understand and as we just read\n[416.0s] that this business that is being\n[418.8s] conducted by Satan himself through the\n[421.8s] many people or through a name called\n[425.7s] medicine medicine we know that this is\n[427.8s] the sorcery of the papacy. These are the\n[431.1s] plans of the papacy that they may\n[433.4s] destroy people and kill people in an\n[436.1s] earlier age so that people do not make\n[438.7s] decisions. In the book of Revelation\n[441.4s] chapter 18 verse 23, can someone read?\n[445.8s] It says\n[448.4s] shall no more. Uh-huh.\n[452.2s] Uh-huh.\n[456.1s] Shall be heard no more. Uhhuh.\n[460.0s] Uh-huh. For thy\n[463.4s] merchants were the great men of the\n[465.8s] earth today. Who are the great men of\n[467.4s] the earth? the merchants, the\n[470.6s] businessmen. But what are they selling\n[472.6s] to the people? Things that harm the\n[475.5s] system and things that kill people's\n[477.9s] law. But sure, continue\n[480.4s] reading. For by thy\n[484.0s] sorceries today, the only is deceived\n[487.9s] because the sorcery of the great men who\n[491.7s] are deceiving people. So sorcery is full\n[494.6s] everywhere. Today even food many foods\n[498.1s] that are being made. For example, today\n[500.4s] we have plastic cabbages, we have\n[503.2s] plastic rice. These are sorceries that\n[506.7s] are killing people slowly by\n[510.8s] slowly. So that what I wanted to\n[513.6s] understand that the project of medicine\n[516.9s] it is a project of Satan himself because\n[519.7s] it is a sorcery and it is a a\n[522.7s] witchcraft. Just Ellen White as he was\n[525.3s] shown he have told us that medical\n[528.1s] fraternity is what a free m. So what are\n[532.6s] the freemasons and what are their\n[538.0s] aims? If drug if the drug uh the drug\n[542.4s] itself uh the drug company is being\n[545.4s] supported with free mans what is the\n[550.1s] aim to destroy. So today I would like us\n[554.1s] to enter into the solution because we\n[558.3s] were looking way forward. We have\n[561.0s] learned that the drug is not the way. So\n[563.8s] today I would like us to look some\n[568.1s] remedies that is going to help our\n[571.3s] system and uh this is the point that we\n[574.8s] stopped at last time. Someone can echo\n[577.5s] it again from the book of\n[579.1s] Jeremiah 8 verse 21.\n[585.7s] Uhhuh.\n[587.7s] Uhhuh. Mhm.\n[591.8s] Uhhuh. Why God is that? Because of the\n[595.2s] kind of treatment and medication that\n[597.4s] people are\n[598.8s] pursuing from Satan himself. Verse 22.\n[604.2s] It says,\n[606.1s] \"If there are no is there no bulb in\n[608.7s] Gilead?\" Is there no bulb in Gilead?\n[613.3s] is no is there no physician there?\n[619.4s] And that is the question that we asked\n[621.3s] last time that is there no physician in\n[624.0s] the places we live. Is there no B the\n[627.4s] world we are living? But we need to\n[629.6s] answer that there is B and thereians\n[633.2s] because God has called us to be what? to\n[635.6s] be medical missionaries who are going to\n[638.3s] understand the cause of diseases and the\n[640.9s] medication itself. Let us move forward.\n[644.6s] The book of U\n[647.6s] PH this is 14 sorry for\n[651.9s] 1144\n[653.7s] 8.1 I'm just missing for there that\n[657.3s] reads the the simple remedies are less\n[660.5s] harmful than drug poisons in reion to\n[664.2s] their simplicity but in every many cases\n[667.3s] these are used when not at all\n[670.2s] necessary.\n[671.9s] The next paragraph, there are simple\n[675.0s] herbs and roots that every family may\n[678.6s] use for themselves. So, every family to\n[681.3s] use what? Herbs. We are being told that\n[684.8s] every family to use what? Herbs. Because\n[688.6s] Mhm. Continue reading.\n[691.3s] Simple. They are simple herbs.\n[695.1s] Pick themselves\n[698.8s] call in a physician. Uhhuh. any sooner\n[702.5s] than they will call a lawyer. So there\n[705.3s] are there are many harms and even roots\n[708.5s] that can help so that people might not\n[711.0s] be calling physician each and every\n[713.1s] time. Today why many people are calling\n[716.4s] physicians because they do not\n[718.5s] understand how the system how the body\n[721.6s] system works. So if you understand how\n[724.4s] our body system works, we are not going\n[726.6s] to call\n[728.0s] manians because we have hs everywhere.\n[731.4s] We have roots everywhere. Mhm. The book\n[737.8s] of\n[739.3s] CME 29 paragraph 4. You can also note\n[742.9s] that one. And we see the need of workers\n[746.4s] today because after learning that the\n[749.0s] drugs are no solution to our life, we\n[751.3s] need now to go to the chief physician\n[753.4s] who is Christ. Even Christ never\n[757.0s] administered drugs to the patients he\n[759.5s] attended to. But also Christ gave them\n[763.0s] the natural way that God has commanded.\n[767.4s] It reads workers workers gospel uh\n[771.0s] gospel medical missionaries are needed\n[774.0s] now. When are the gospel uh when are the\n[777.4s] workers gospel missionaries needed? Now\n[780.1s] it is now. Continue. You cannot afford\n[782.2s] to spend years in preparation. We can\n[784.6s] just not say that we are year after year\n[787.7s] we are still preparing to do the work.\n[790.3s] Soon doors now open. Soon doors now\n[793.8s] open. Soon doors now open. The truth\n[796.6s] will be forever closed to the truth will\n[798.9s] be forever closed. Carry the message\n[801.2s] now. Carry the message now. Not wait.\n[803.8s] And not wait. Allow the Do not wait.\n[806.7s] Allow the enemy to take possession\n[808.7s] Uhhuh. of the fields now open before\n[811.6s] you. Continue reading. Let compassy go\n[814.2s] forth to do the work to which Christ\n[816.6s] appointed his disciples let them labor\n[819.4s] as evangelists. Let us now labor as\n[821.7s] evangelists. Scattering our\n[823.4s] publications. scattering our\n[825.0s] publications and talking of the truth to\n[827.2s] those they meet. Let them pray for the\n[830.0s] sick. Let them pray for the sick.\n[832.2s] Ministering to their necessities.\n[834.3s] Uh-huh. Not with drugs. Not with drugs.\n[837.6s] Not with drugs. Uhhuh. But with nature's\n[840.6s] remedies. But with nature's remedy and\n[843.1s] teaching them how to regain health and\n[845.5s] teaching now people how to regain health\n[847.6s] and avoid disease. And avoid disease. So\n[851.2s] today we are being called as evangelist.\n[853.8s] We are being called as medical\n[855.1s] missionary to scatter the publication\n[858.2s] that carries the old truth that we\n[860.6s] proclaim. Because sometimes in the\n[863.5s] message will not be some people may not\n[866.2s] have heard the message but through our\n[869.6s] publications we will write and we will\n[872.2s] publish and people might know what they\n[875.4s] must what they must believe or what they\n[879.0s] must trust including the first annual\n[882.0s] message. The second, the third because\n[884.5s] in the third message it carry the\n[887.8s] various messages that is the\n[890.7s] book CME page 29 paragraph\n[894.9s] 4. Then\n[899.0s] 90 then ministry of billing page\n[904.1s] 147 90 page sorry 90 page 172 paragraph\n[908.8s] 4. It reads that let them labor as\n[912.8s] evangelists scattering our publication\n[915.8s] and taking and talking of the truth to\n[919.0s] those they meet. Let them pray for the\n[921.4s] sick, ministering to their necessities,\n[924.0s] not with drugs, but with nature's remedy\n[926.8s] and teaching them how to regain health\n[929.0s] and avoid diseases. And that is the\n[931.3s] responsibility that Christ has given us\n[934.4s] so that we may labor much that people\n[937.4s] may live in a way that they cannot be\n[941.8s] affected by diseases and give them the\n[944.4s] the present truth. Also the book\n[948.3s] of medical the book of ministry of\n[951.0s] healing page 146 paragraph 1 it reads it\n[955.1s] reads\n[956.8s] all gospel workers all gospel workers\n[959.8s] should know how to give the simple\n[961.8s] treatments\n[965.6s] all all all yes to mean all if you are a\n[968.7s] gospel worker you you are not a medical\n[970.8s] missionary are you fulfilling the law\n[973.2s] that are you fulfilling the work that\n[975.5s] Christ gave but you are being told that\n[978.1s] all workers whether you are young or\n[981.5s] old we should have a knowledge on how to\n[985.2s] give what simple treatments because we\n[988.4s] have several simple treatments for\n[990.6s] example we have hydrotherapy those are\n[994.4s] the kinds of simple treatments that we\n[997.0s] can have we have physiootherapy the\n[999.4s] massage those are the kind of simple\n[1001.6s] treatments that each and every one of us\n[1005.0s] have to know. So make sure that after\n[1007.6s] coming from this place as a gospel\n[1010.5s] worker, you have a eat of giving simple\n[1014.7s] treatments that do so much to relieve\n[1017.6s] pain and remove disease because soon as\n[1021.1s] we have been told that the work of\n[1023.3s] gospel work may is going to be closed.\n[1026.8s] But if we have knowledge on how to give\n[1029.0s] simple treatments that do so much to\n[1031.8s] relieve pain and remove diseases many\n[1034.6s] many doors are going to be open. Just\n[1036.7s] continue reading with the next paragraph\n[1038.8s] there. Every disease every every gospel\n[1041.8s] worker every gospel worker will feel\n[1044.2s] that the giving of instruction uh in the\n[1048.1s] principles of healthful living uh is a\n[1050.9s] part his appoint is is a part of his\n[1055.3s] appointed work. So we have today many\n[1057.8s] ministers who are saying that with me\n[1060.2s] I'm not a medical missionary I'm just\n[1063.0s] I'm I'm just interested in other part\n[1065.6s] but we are being told that every gospel\n[1068.1s] worker should feel that the giving of\n[1071.0s] instruction the principle of healthful\n[1072.6s] living is a is a part of it appointed\n[1076.2s] work. So each and every individual has\n[1078.9s] what? Something to do something to do.\n[1082.2s] We cannot just relax that we have the\n[1085.0s] the medical missionary department. The\n[1087.8s] medical missionary department is not for\n[1090.2s] what individual person but it's a call\n[1092.7s] to everyone that they should feel and\n[1095.8s] understand the responsibility that\n[1097.9s] Christ has given them. Continue reading\n[1099.6s] it of this work. Uhhuh. There's a great\n[1102.6s] need. There is a great need and the\n[1105.1s] world is open for it today. Every place\n[1108.1s] there is there is no one who is going to\n[1110.1s] reject the work of medical missionary\n[1112.9s] because everywhere people are sick.\n[1115.2s] Everywhere people need the true treating\n[1118.6s] of the true method of treating the body.\n[1121.8s] That's we have read from the book\n[1123.6s] ministry of healing page 147. You can\n[1126.6s] also write it down. So we understand\n[1129.3s] that each and every person as an\n[1132.1s] individual work to have the knowledge in\n[1135.6s] simple treatment of disease and\n[1137.9s] relieving pain and even removing the\n[1140.4s] disease. But as you have learned the\n[1142.4s] last time that removing disease we must\n[1145.4s] understand the cause and the cause must\n[1147.5s] be\n[1148.4s] what? The cause must\n[1150.8s] be agent. If we understand that method,\n[1154.3s] that true method of healing, we are\n[1156.6s] going to help many and we are going to\n[1158.9s] bring many people to Christ. So this is\n[1161.6s] the method and the way that Christ has\n[1164.6s] gave that as he sent his disciples to be\n[1168.4s] missionaries who will understand the\n[1171.6s] necessities of giving the right\n[1173.9s] principles of health to people who need\n[1177.4s] Christ.\n[1178.8s] Today in the book of\n[1181.4s] um PH\n[1184.7s] PH 1448 paragraph\n[1190.2s] 3. It reads it says it says I do not\n[1194.2s] think that I can give you any definite\n[1196.3s] line of medicine\n[1198.4s] compounded and and dealt out by doctors\n[1201.9s] that are harm that are perfectly\n[1203.7s] harmless. Uh-huh. And yet and yet it\n[1206.6s] will not be wisdom to engage in\n[1208.8s] controversy. Mhm. Over this subject just\n[1212.9s] leave from that point. I think we have\n[1214.8s] written it down. We will you will still\n[1218.6s] read it later because of time. Let me go\n[1221.4s] to another one another quote. That one\n[1224.2s] we have look. So after having learned\n[1227.3s] that we want to look various simple\n[1231.3s] remedies that is going to help us\n[1233.9s] because we say that our food should be\n[1236.4s] what? Our should our food should be our\n[1240.7s] medicine but we should not take medic we\n[1243.8s] should not take medicine as what? As\n[1246.5s] food. So we want to look various\n[1250.8s] remedies that today we have prepared so\n[1254.6s] that we might\n[1256.9s] understand the time we are\n[1260.4s] living. We read that one last time. I\n[1263.0s] will not read it again. Now we will read\n[1265.4s] from the book medical missionary page\n[1267.5s] 320 paragraph 2 and paragraph\n[1270.9s] 3. It says it says learn how to combat\n[1274.9s] disease. Now that is the major point\n[1277.1s] that you need to understand from out\n[1278.9s] from this place that you you should know\n[1281.9s] how to combat what disease. Know how to\n[1285.3s] combat what? Disease. Continue.\n[1288.6s] Gather up all the knowledge possible\n[1291.7s] that will help to combat disease. So it\n[1294.2s] is still your work to do what? To gather\n[1297.0s] all knowledge possible that will help to\n[1299.5s] combat disease. How are you going to\n[1301.6s] gather this knowledge? It is through\n[1304.3s] reading various of what books that are\n[1307.6s] teaching about health and our hearts. It\n[1311.0s] says it says in every place in every\n[1313.7s] place the sick may be found. The sick\n[1316.0s] may be found and those who go forth as\n[1318.2s] workers for Christ those who go forth as\n[1320.9s] workers of Christ should be true health\n[1323.7s] reformers should be true health\n[1325.3s] reformers prepare to give those who are\n[1327.4s] seek the simple treatment that will\n[1330.2s] relieve them and then pray with them.\n[1333.1s] Yeah. Thus they will open the door for\n[1335.2s] the entrance of the truth. Uhhuh. The\n[1337.4s] doing of this work will be followed by\n[1339.4s] good result. Uh-huh. Our Sabbath keeping\n[1342.1s] families should keep their mind filled\n[1344.2s] with helpful principles of health reform\n[1347.0s] and other lines of truth that they may\n[1349.5s] be a help to their neighbors. Amen. Be\n[1352.3s] practical missionaries. So what is\n[1354.6s] needed for us now the time of living\n[1356.8s] that we be what? Practical missionaries.\n[1359.0s] Practical missionaries. Gather up all\n[1361.8s] knowledge possible that will help to\n[1364.2s] combat disease. Amen. This\n[1368.0s] just that point also read HL page 19\n[1372.2s] paragraph\n[1374.1s] 5 HL. It is the duty of every person to\n[1378.0s] become intelligent in regard to disease\n[1380.4s] and it causes. So we have a work to do\n[1383.8s] to become intelligent in regard to\n[1386.3s] disease and it causes and that is the\n[1388.9s] great work that each and every person\n[1392.1s] need to\n[1393.8s] do. Mhm.\n[1399.3s] Yeah, just again in the book of WM page\n[1404.1s] 127 paragraph one it says it says God's\n[1408.2s] people God's people should know how to\n[1410.8s] give the simple treatments Uhhuh. that\n[1413.4s] do much to relieve pain. Uhhuh. And to\n[1416.5s] remove diseases and to remove disaseshu\n[1421.1s] eggs and pains Uhhuh. have left you\n[1423.5s] without the use of medicine.\n[1426.4s] What is the definition of disease? What\n[1428.5s] is the definition of disease? Disease is\n[1430.2s] an effort of nature to free the system\n[1432.6s] from conditions. Mhm. That result from a\n[1435.5s] violation of the laws of health. So I\n[1438.2s] think that foundation that I have built,\n[1440.5s] it is enough for us to have knowledge in\n[1443.7s] combating diseases and even relieving\n[1446.4s] pain in using some simple remedies. And\n[1449.1s] now one of the simple remedies that we\n[1451.3s] will like and start off is some of kind\n[1453.8s] of foods is kind of food that many\n[1456.6s] people know and many people use. So the\n[1460.8s] best natural remedies that we should\n[1463.1s] know it is keeping the commandments of\n[1466.4s] God and eight laws of health. Why?\n[1469.6s] Because number one, we understand that\n[1471.7s] if we go against law number four that\n[1475.1s] speak about\n[1476.7s] water and we if we go against law number\n[1479.7s] four, we know very well that a lot of\n[1482.8s] water is required into the system.\n[1485.2s] Number one, who knows the work of the\n[1487.8s] water in the system into the system.\n[1490.7s] Number one, we have various work of\n[1492.7s] water in the body. Number\n[1496.6s] one, gas exchange. Number two,\n[1502.2s] uh, number three,\n[1506.7s] we don't know the uses of water in the\n[1508.5s] body. Digestion. What helps to cool the\n[1511.2s] system? Digestion.\n[1513.7s] Digestion. Another\n[1515.8s] one. What about the body? Even\n[1519.0s] transportation. Even\n[1521.2s] transportation. Uh-huh. What about the\n[1524.3s] engine? How many percentage is required?\n[1529.4s] The brain is the engine of the body. So\n[1531.8s] we must understand that the brain is the\n[1533.4s] what? Is the engine of the body. It\n[1536.1s] controls the whole system. How you\n[1538.3s] speak, how you talk, how you laugh, how\n[1541.0s] you walk. It's the brain. It's the what?\n[1543.0s] The brain. And we understand the various\n[1546.1s] work of parts of the brain. So I will\n[1548.8s] not go into details to bring anatomy.\n[1551.8s] But I would just like us to take us\n[1553.3s] through this natural remedies. And the\n[1555.6s] best natural simple treatment is by\n[1557.6s] what? Water. Water is everywhere. And if\n[1561.5s] we use water wisely, many people are not\n[1564.0s] going to get sick. Today many people\n[1568.1s] don't know how much water they should\n[1570.0s] drink a\n[1571.4s] day. How many waters should a person\n[1576.2s] weigh 60 kg\n[1579.6s] drink? How can you understand? How can\n[1582.2s] you know the the water that you should\n[1585.0s] take a\n[1587.3s] day? By doing\n[1590.4s] what? By doing calculation. So I never\n[1595.1s] put it there but we we uh there is the\n[1599.9s] mathematics here that\n[1602.6s] if 1\n[1604.8s] kilogram is assumed to take 50 ml of\n[1608.2s] water. Therefore, 60 kilm will take how\n[1612.8s] much water? And we understand that 1,00\n[1615.7s] ml is equal to how many lit? One lit.\n[1619.4s] So, can you\n[1621.6s] calculate 60 * 50 / 1,00 that is\n[1627.9s] 3,00 1,000 is how many lit? 3 L. So if\n[1633.5s] you are 60 kilg how many how much water\n[1638.2s] should you take? It is 3 lit because\n[1642.8s] if 1 kilogram is assumed to be 50 ml.\n[1648.0s] Therefore if you are 50 how many will be\n[1651.5s] that is 50 * 50 that is 2500ide by 1,000\n[1657.5s] it is 2.5. So calculate and you know you\n[1661.6s] have kilograms and you calculate. What\n[1664.2s] about\n[1668.0s] BMI? BMI. How can we calculate the\n[1672.8s] BMI? It is\n[1677.2s] what to do BMI body mass index. How to\n[1682.1s] know whether you have a lot of\n[1683.6s] cholesterols or you you you fall under\n[1687.0s] normal range because normal range of BMI\n[1690.0s] is\n[1690.8s] 18.5 to\n[1692.6s] 24.9. So if you are below 18.5\n[1697.0s] gi\n[1700.7s] your you are not you don't have normal\n[1703.4s] BMI. So you need to calculate that one.\n[1705.5s] It is weight. I think it is weight over\n[1708.1s] square or height square over\n[1711.4s] weight. It is\n[1724.0s] weight. Let assume someone is 1.7 cm.\n[1728.2s] You square 1.7 cm. Then you divide with\n[1735.1s] 60\n[1738.8s] kg 1.7 60\n[1741.6s] kg let us just do very\n[1746.4s] fast 60 / 1.7\n[1753.6s] squared no m sorry it is 1 7 m it is no\n[1758.7s] cm\n[1760.8s] Sorry, it is you need to call\n[1766.2s] to time\n[1776.6s] please. It is what?\n[1781.5s] 60 / 1.7\n[1785.4s] 2 1 1.7 * 1.7 you get the answer.\n[1794.0s] Then\n[1807.7s] 10. It seems like some of us never took\n[1816.7s] maths.\n[1823.2s] 2.89 by\n[1826.2s] 60. Yeah.\n[1832.5s] 20.76. So if if such a person was having\n[1837.4s] such height and weight 20.6 that range\n[1841.1s] under normal BMI because it range from\n[1844.8s] 18.5 to\n[1848.0s] 24.9 that is the range of under normal\n[1851.2s] BMI. So if you are above or below the\n[1854.6s] intake of fats should be reduced. But we\n[1858.1s] understand that there are natural fats\n[1859.8s] in the body and now if only we only if\n[1864.5s] people like taking the deep fried foods\n[1867.0s] animal products uh it will bring such a\n[1870.2s] range of high. Let us be back here. The\n[1874.6s] next lesson we will handle water in\n[1876.3s] details how we can use water to cure all\n[1879.7s] the diseases in the body. We have theapy\n[1883.1s] and idotherapy we have steam baths. We\n[1885.4s] have hot food bath. We have hot\n[1887.9s] fermentation among others that we will\n[1889.8s] look into details because those are the\n[1891.9s] kind of simple remedies that are around.\n[1894.7s] Timekeeper will be alerting me if\n[1896.7s] remains 30 minutes. So don't forget to\n[1900.2s] do\n[1901.2s] that. So we have number one we have\n[1904.4s] cabbage. Now these are the simple\n[1906.5s] remedies that we have around. Number one\n[1909.8s] is cabbage. So if you can get a place or\n[1913.0s] somewhere you are writing you can this\n[1915.4s] you can write the benefits of the\n[1917.2s] cabbage. And now what we must understand\n[1920.5s] that\n[1921.9s] fruits, salads and juices those are the\n[1925.7s] best remedies that helps to cleanse the\n[1928.6s] system and even to strengthen the cells\n[1930.9s] of the body. So number one we must\n[1933.4s] understand that juice juices and salad\n[1937.3s] foods are required in the body because\n[1940.4s] they help in removing toxins and even\n[1943.4s] rebuilding some cells which have been\n[1945.7s] destroyed. So number one we have\n[1947.7s] cabbage. I think we can see it there\n[1951.2s] clearly and we have benefits of the\n[1955.6s] cabbage. Number one controls blood\n[1959.8s] pressure. Number two, protects bones\n[1963.1s] from\n[1964.4s] weakening. Number three, promotes good\n[1967.6s] eye health. For those who are having eye\n[1969.7s] problems, they need to fade in mostly in\n[1973.7s] cabbage\n[1977.7s] juices. Sometimes cabbage is sometimes\n[1981.2s] being overcooked until the nutrients\n[1983.6s] required now are not present present.\n[1987.0s] Number three or number four help in\n[1989.4s] weight loss for those who have BMI above\n[1994.3s] 24.9 going\n[1996.4s] upwards. Uh-huh. Number the next is\n[2000.2s] detoxify the body. It removes the toxin\n[2003.4s] from the\n[2006.2s] bodys as blood sugar regulator. Those\n[2009.2s] who are suffering from diabetes, it can\n[2011.5s] help reduces the risk of having ulcer.\n[2015.0s] It is the best remedy by the way for\n[2017.1s] dealing with\n[2019.2s] cancer. We you can make a juice from it.\n[2023.3s] You can make a salad from it. It\n[2028.2s] prevent\n[2032.4s] pimples relieves in\n[2035.2s] constipation. That is a problem someone\n[2038.8s] can have even in a period or in a time\n[2042.3s] that if we don't take a lot of water\n[2044.1s] into the system sometimes we can have\n[2047.6s] constipation improve\n[2050.3s] digestion okay digestion then the next\n[2053.8s] one which is here which is not there it\n[2057.4s] helps in arthritis you can write down I\n[2060.7s] hope you are writing because we have\n[2063.4s] learned that from this place we need to\n[2065.0s] be gospel workers as who know how to\n[2067.4s] combat\n[2068.4s] disease, who know how to prevent\n[2071.4s] disease. So if we will be mentioning and\n[2073.7s] you are not writing sometimes I will be\n[2075.9s] wondering if you will take note later.\n[2079.0s] Uhhuh. Then another one also it it helps\n[2082.8s] in inflammations. For\n[2086.9s] example, we will have a pis from this\n[2090.6s] one and you you can just mash it in hot\n[2094.5s] water. Then you tie it in a inflamed\n[2098.4s] area. We have various inflammation.\n[2100.9s] Inflammation can be in the hands.\n[2103.2s] Inflammation can be in the various parts\n[2105.2s] of the body. Do we understand that if\n[2108.2s] there inflammations in the body, it\n[2110.7s] means there is no better circulation of\n[2112.4s] the blood into the system. Again, it\n[2116.8s] I've said that it helps in the\n[2118.8s] inflammation or inflammatory.\n[2122.2s] It also helps when you are bited with by\n[2126.0s] insects. Insects such as bees, we have\n[2129.2s] worms, wasp among others which is a good\n[2133.5s] remedy for that arthritis. It will deal\n[2137.4s] it will\n[2138.8s] help inflammations among others. You\n[2141.9s] will also add more many more on that.\n[2145.4s] Let us go\n[2150.6s] to let us look another one. This is\n[2155.0s] onion. I hope we understand onion and we\n[2157.8s] know onion very\n[2159.2s] well. Uh onion is one of\n[2164.0s] the one of the medicines that is being\n[2167.1s] that is being used to help in various\n[2169.4s] diseases.\n[2171.0s] We have number one in that other side.\n[2176.2s] Fight\n[2177.2s] cancer, promote respiratory health. If\n[2180.2s] you have asthma, we have various\n[2182.8s] diseases in the respiratory system. It\n[2185.7s] will help low blood sugar levels,\n[2189.0s] enhance eye. It is the best remedy also\n[2191.4s] to use when someone is having an eye\n[2194.4s] problem. You can make a soup from it or\n[2198.2s] you can make a pies from it. And then\n[2200.2s] you tie to the eyes\n[2203.0s] onions and hair growth. It helps in hair\n[2206.0s] growth. It adds some elements that helps\n[2209.8s] in the hair growth. And number one\n[2211.7s] elements that help in the air growth is\n[2213.8s] zinc. So it does it contain various\n[2216.9s] elements such as zinc that also have to\n[2220.1s] maintain black hair and to have good\n[2223.4s] health growth and has brain health. It\n[2225.5s] also helps the brain, prevents\n[2227.6s] inflammation and other allergies. Those\n[2230.4s] who are suffering and having\n[2232.8s] difficulties with allergy, it helps.\n[2235.7s] Rich in antioxidant compounds, contain\n[2238.1s] anti-cancer compounds are antibacterial.\n[2241.7s] There are various bacteria that can\n[2243.6s] affect the body. For example, we have\n[2247.0s] elictor H.\n[2248.9s] pylori which\n[2252.0s] sometimes causes also the ulcers itself.\n[2256.1s] It helps in that we have various\n[2257.7s] bacteras, we have various viruses, we\n[2261.0s] have various\n[2263.3s] what may support heart health, may\n[2266.2s] support bone health to those people who\n[2269.0s] sometimes complain of their\n[2272.0s] bones. It helps it contain also\n[2275.4s] magnesium and calcium because element\n[2279.0s] which is magnesium and calcium they are\n[2281.3s] helping making strong bones. They supply\n[2284.7s] the necessities that are required by\n[2286.4s] wounds to help may support your gut\n[2289.5s] health may regulate blood pressure\n[2292.6s] respiratory system because of time allow\n[2295.4s] me to go a bit faster. Kidogo I use I\n[2298.9s] give the remaining 20 minutes to the\n[2302.1s] class. Okay. at your also on time you\n[2304.8s] can come and have this presentation and\n[2308.4s] you can inquire more books containing\n[2310.7s] the same remedies because sometimes time\n[2313.3s] will not allow us to look them all in\n[2315.2s] details but we will\n[2318.0s] still see on how we will have knowledge\n[2321.0s] on them here we have a spinach how many\n[2323.2s] people know spinach I think we all know\n[2325.9s] spinach very well it helps in preventing\n[2328.6s] cancer keep us relaxed keep our hair\n[2331.8s] nails and skin healthy\n[2333.9s] help us maintain healthy body weight.\n[2336.4s] Rich in protein. If you want\n[2339.1s] protein, obtain it from spinach. Obtain\n[2342.8s] it from nuts. Rich in vitamin C. We know\n[2346.0s] the work of vitamin C. Help us build\n[2348.7s] strong bones. There are some people\n[2351.4s] still complain of the bones. They can\n[2353.7s] feed on stomach. The best is having it\n[2357.4s] as a help us build strong bones. improve\n[2360.7s] digestion, gut health, good for our\n[2363.5s] eyes. It is also a good remedy for eye\n[2366.4s] because it contain vitamin A, regulate\n[2369.1s] blood\n[2371.5s] sugar. These are the same also other\n[2375.1s] uses, boost immunity.\n[2381.8s] Mhm. Helps also the brain, prevent\n[2384.4s] anemia problems. Those who are having\n[2387.0s] anemia, it contains a lot of ions that\n[2390.5s] helps in the blood formation so that\n[2393.0s] your body have the maximum required\n[2396.3s] blood to perform the duties of the\n[2398.2s] system.\n[2412.1s] We have\n[2415.0s] banana. Health benefits of eating a\n[2418.4s] banana. Improve\n[2420.5s] digestion. Improve heart health. Boost\n[2424.6s] energy. Reduce inflammation. Enhance\n[2428.9s] mood. Strengthen the bones. Improve\n[2432.2s] kidney function. Those are the benefits\n[2436.5s] of eating bananas. So we need to take\n[2439.6s] fruits. We need to take nuts and cereals\n[2442.6s] among others that are required in the\n[2444.4s] body. We must understand that if we\n[2446.5s] don't take balanced\n[2448.8s] diet, our body will not get the elements\n[2453.4s] because the elements are very important\n[2455.4s] in the body. Magnesium, calcium, ion,\n[2460.1s] phosphorus, chlorine, they have\n[2462.6s] different bodies. They have different\n[2464.1s] works in the body. So if we don't take\n[2466.2s] in the the body, you will still hear\n[2469.2s] many people\n[2472.8s] complaining because we don't take we\n[2475.1s] don't feed in a balanced diet that we\n[2477.4s] are going to get all these elements all\n[2480.3s] these minerals and all these nutrients\n[2483.1s] that help to build the body. We have\n[2487.8s] watermelon to those who don't doesn't\n[2490.2s] like drinking water. Watermelon also\n[2494.2s] help because it is water than me. So it\n[2499.7s] have a lot of\n[2503.2s] water. Promote heart health. Strengthen\n[2506.6s] the immune\n[2508.4s] system. Improve male\n[2511.6s] fertility. Aids in diabetes\n[2514.5s] treatment. Improve brain\n[2517.0s] health. Enhance digestive health.\n[2520.6s] strengthen hair, improve skin health,\n[2523.5s] slow down\n[2528.7s] aging. Let us look at this one also.\n[2532.2s] This is cayenne pepper and\n[2535.0s] also cayenne\n[2538.6s] pepper. It is the one of the major\n[2543.3s] painillers that is\n[2545.9s] used. Number one, improve circulation.\n[2550.9s] More so when someone is tired it\n[2554.4s] means there is no full circulation in\n[2557.2s] the\n[2558.0s] system. But if you drink if you you\n[2561.2s] drink cayenne if you you it is being\n[2564.6s] used also in the\n[2566.0s] massage to increase the flow of the\n[2569.7s] blood into the\n[2571.3s] system. Uh treat stomach ulcers lower\n[2575.0s] blood pressure. Relieve constipation.\n[2578.0s] Kill garden pest\n[2580.2s] detoxification. Fight cold and flu.\n[2583.6s] Lower blood pressure. Heart conditions.\n[2587.2s] Prevent heart attack. Sen relieve\n[2590.8s] digestive aid. Relieve pain.\n[2598.4s] Toothachenitis wounds fever weight loss\n[2604.6s] headaches congestion. So those are the\n[2607.6s] among the benefits of using these kinds\n[2611.4s] of remedies. Now there is a major remedy\n[2614.2s] here called\n[2616.4s] grapes. In our next lesson we will also\n[2619.1s] look gra in details because grapes it is\n[2623.2s] almost containing all these elements. I\n[2625.8s] can see it has water, energy, protein,\n[2628.9s] carbohydrates, fiber, sugar, calcium,\n[2632.7s] lipids, magnesium, phosphorus among many\n[2636.2s] others. So it is a very good remedy to\n[2639.8s] use to be used\n[2643.3s] while revitalizing the body. When\n[2650.4s] someone the best remedies will the best\n[2653.4s] remedy will be grapes. We will see what\n[2656.0s] we can mix with it to help the body\n[2660.2s] provide to provide the body with the\n[2663.1s] required element. Grapes is a best\n[2666.2s] remedy when using with someone.\n[2672.8s] This one will help him to regain energy\n[2676.5s] faster because it contains all these\n[2679.0s] elements that the body required even\n[2681.9s] that the immune system is required also\n[2685.2s] to rejuvenate the white blood cells.

        "full_transcript": "I'm also a lover of history and when church was being presented I was in Christ by something that I want to read uh I said that I have to read this month before this congregation before I go into the subject moment I'm reading in three three Bible page 174 when the teacher of church. He was talking about somebody called James White. I said that I had to read this thing before this congregation because I loved the characteristics of James White and the God is calling for James White in the last days to be able to carry on the work uh the work that the Lord has left us. That is the work of preaching the news message. There is three bio three biography 4 paragraph 36 I'm commenting about what the teacher said about James White and I'm going to read the funeral program of James White when he died in 188 what James White died 18 which month which date fixed you need to know that now this is Smith who was the secretary of the general conference when James went was working. Uh 374 paragraph 6 says Smith enumerated in some detail giving illustrations predominating traits and characteristics of a man with whom he had worked intimately for so many years. We first noticed that in the times of confusion and excitement he was what? Always calm and cool. Are we together? That is the first characteristics of who? James White. In times of confusion, James White was always calm and what? And cool. We are told. Secondly, he was a man never given to what fanatism. Number three, he was thirdly, he was endured with remarkable acuteness of perception to determine the most delicious moves to be made. Hallelujah. Those are characteristics of whom James went. Fourthly, he was a man who would never to discuss discouragement. And I love that the word fail was not in his what? Vocabul. Hallelujah. God is calling for him today who can never what? Discouragement. Amen. And I see him in the meeting. There are people here the word fail cannot be what vocabulary. Fifthly, he was a man who looked forward to the future ones of his work and make provision for them. He foraw that certain elements stability of stability must be wrote into the work which could be secured only through what? Organization. Sixthly, he was a man of strong personal apprentip of a remarkably generous nature to have a regard for the interest of others and to see that their circumstances were rendered as favorable as possible was a part of his name. Amen. So I love those characteristics of James White. And when the teacher was speaking about James White, I was very impressed by that point and I say I had to read it. But I said that the James White of the last days are going to die up early. And if they are not if they don't die early, it means that they're not what working. I'm still contemplating upon that. If you are against wife in the congregation, do meditate upon that. May God bless the teacher of we shall be talking about that. I know that the Lord has led us in the past we don't fear for the people for the future. Amen. So welcome again to the class of education educator. This class I look on very few things. This class I'm going to give much time for question and answer because I only have two classes that is remaining. In my next class I'll be looking away for a solution in regation and that is what we had looking when last we about the one aim of the purple systemation I realize that the aim of the purple system is to do what to overthrow what to overthrow protestantism I don't know how to say that is in his way but I know that the first aim of the purple and the system of education is to make sure that protestants are destroyed. Realize that papacy does this through the order of Jesuits. Are we together? When was the order of J established? when by whom somebody of them can apply and we have controversy in 234 told us that what they do is that they what they are together they don't visit schools they don't say they establish schools but they They invented the war or dolls prisons get the poor. But for the young children they do what? They they established schools for the what for the common people and the colleges for the children of the princess and by that the children of Protestants were drawn into the observance of popish what popish right that was southern soldiers that the best way to control protestants is just to control their education. Education examples remaining 14. What made me the declaration of the United Nations is that they never understood the true science of what? Education. Hallelujah. And therefore seventh day adventist that was to them an example. Those things were written that they need to be a what? An example that this last days if are not going to understand the two sides of education their information are not going for because they realize that the message and the two of the two And he also realized that the education is the birthight of what of information on a man and I was very happy when the teacher of church heritage was also saying that what is the catalyst of information the catalyst Who are these people in the class? What is the catalyst of reformation? Well, you will tell them the catalyst of reformation is publishing house. And we saw that the present true publishing house was established in year but you were in class and 1850 go. So the catalyst of information is republic publishing. The path right and what strengthens the information is through science of educate education while the right arm of the gospel becomes the what medical missionary. Amen. So those three things that is that we have to maintain our what publishing ourselves schools is going to restaurants. Hallelujah. You will only establish restaurants after establishing house as an school. Hallelujah. Don't run for a restaurant before even establishing one school. Amen. Say amen. Hallelujah. P the B is for information then the right arm that is missionary then you can go for a restaurant. Amen. So in this class I'm going to give very brief notes very brief. and try to be brief and give time for more questions. Now last time we left at the point where we say that we need schools that are going to repudiate the principles of purpose. Hallelujah. I'll take from that in the next class and we'll see how to establish schools, what is to be taught in the schools and also the selection of teachers to teach in the world in the schools. Are we together? So that I want to preserve for the next lesson and my last lesson the topic of my last lesson will be you must be able to decide for himself. Amen. So if the question that we'll be having that be we'll be touching on the how to establish schools what is to be taught in schools and the selection of teachers you can preserve that question for the next class but today I'm going to give generally the questions of all the studies that I've been having in this class. If you had a question, kindly prepare your question because I'm going to eat time. But as for now, I want to begin giving the characteristics of true and the true education and the characteristics of worldly system education. Then I give a few a very brief then I look at two examples only two examples. I look at Christ today and look at the Greek history very brief. then I'll be able to finish my presentation. I'll be very brief. Now write characteristics of true and false system of education. Then we begin with false system education. The book of James 3:3 is what are beginning to read is there is where we are going to pick our characteristics and see them very fast. Somebody is there to help me read. Brother God pray you can just come and sit here use a microphone to help me read these things very fast. And you will also help me project the quotations because those who are sitting there is like they have gone for a short break and they are coming back. So you can fill that position. James 3 and the 13 the Bible says hallelujah 3:1 and you also take your book and write the following. The Bible says James says James 3:3 The Bible says if you have But if you have bitter envy and strive in your heart not do not glory not lie not against and lie not against the truth. This wisdom the wisdom that comprises of envy and strife descended not from above. It descended not from above. And it is earthly it is earthly sensual sensual and devilish and devilish and we saw that that the first method of the district system of education is to make people complete so right of systemation number one it it comprises of beta envy it comprises of beta envy somebody's looking at the wall thinking that they're being projected I'm not going to project them let me Just read them for you in this laptop and write them. It comprises of beta environ. Number two, it promotes strife in the heart. It promotes strife in the heart. Number three, it does not descend from above. Number two, promote strength in the heart. Promote strength in the heart. promote strive in the heart. The next says it, it does not descend from above. Amen. In other words, it does not descend from the father. In the book of John 8:44, we tell you that anything that does not desend from the father comes from who? Satan. Amen. Anything false is satanic. Amen. So it does not descend from above. It is earthly. It is earthly. It is earthly. That is number four. Number five, it is sensual. It is sensual. Number five, it is satanic stroke. Demonic stroke delish. In other words, put in bracket. It makes people worship us. It is a satanic paganism, demonic, devilish. Those are the same things. I'm going to the characteristics of education the book of James chapter 3. You proceed I'll try read the Bible. Uh 3 verse number 15. The Bible says this wisdom this wisdom descendant from above. It does not descend from above it is sensual and deish those ones we have written that is the characteristics of purple system education and world system education or you can still write system of education but realize that we have another kind of education. Now you can also write characteristics of true education. characteristics of truth education. Philippians 3 16 the Bible says it says from ending and strife is there is confusion and every evil one but the wisdom that is from above the wisdom that is from above that is first the first characteristic of true education it descendeth from above write that it descendeth from above it is godly it is godly and promotes Christianity Write that statement that way. It descended from above. It is godly and promotes Christianity. Number two, it is pure. I think the book of James chapter 3 has been projected. It is pure. It is pure. In other words, no unnecessary knowledge. We realize that in the world of education there are necessary what? Knowledge. Amen. And there are things that are taught that should not be taught to Christians today. Today today no unnecessary there's no no any unnecessary knowledge. Number three, it is peaceable. It is peaceable. Write very fast. Write very fast. Time is running. I want to write very fast. It is peaceable. It is gentle. It is peaceable. It is gentle. It is easily treated. Somebody saw that easily in treated full of m is full of nami. It is full of good fruits. It is easily intreated. It is easily intreated. It is full of mer. Full of good fruits. Full of mer. Full of good fruits. without partiality, without hypocrisy. Realize that the worst of education is hypocrisy. It is a form of godliness. You pretend to be loving God, but unite them in works. Without hypocrisy, the fruit of righteousness is sown in its principle. The fields of righteousness is in every characteristics of truth education. Amen. Amen. Education and we say that that is the monique. I'm giving two aims of system education two only. The rest you will go and study for yourself. My first point from the Sabbath was that it it aim is to overthrow what? Protestantism. Number two, write this number two. So if you're writing your I know you write notes on the so if you want to write them just write a purposes then you write continuation then you just write number two are you think it proves the Bible to be error and a theory it proves the Bible to be error and a theory. There was a quotation by was read that was read by brother Neon I think it was ministry of it should be page 443 maybe I'm going to check the page I give but it says that philosophical speculation and scientific research philosophical speculation and scientific research in which God is not acknowledged are making skeptics of thousands in the schools of today the conclusion that learned men have reached as the result of their scientific investigation are carefully taught and fully explained while the impression is distinctly given that if these learned men are correct the Bible cannot be hallelujah hallelujah so we are told that the theories that are taught in school today evolution if they can be correct then the Bible cannot be correct so one of the aim of the purple education is that it proves the Bible to be error and a theory. So that is why today it makes people not study the Bible because they believe that is an error. It is just a theory what is believed. Amen. Next aim it promotes a self this what we tackled in our last so I'm going to deal with few examples and give questions to this class. It promotes self the root of all evil. It promotes self the root of evil. Education page 225 paragraph 4. Education 225 education page 2.5 says precious the service done and the education gained in carrying out these principles but how widely different is much of the education now given from the child's earliest years is an appeal of emulation and rivalry of emulation and what that is. So we are told that it fosters selfishness the root of all evil page paragraph 4. It is not from the beginning. It was taken just the last part where it says that precious the service done and the education gained in carrying out the princip this principles but how widely different is much of the education now given from the child's earliest years that fosters selfishness the root of all what all evil allow me repeat this quotation that was uh testing church 3 page 384 paragraph 3 I think that is the reputation says the following words 384 paragraph 3 384 paragraph number three says it says it says when the lamb and the takes position of the heart and becomes a ruling passion Mhm. That is not what I want. What I want say is under the general heading of selfishness came every other scene. That is what I'm looking for today because the system of education of today strengthens what? Selfishness. Let me check if it is this one. volume 4 paragraph 3 I'm sorry not speech says that another book was opened wherein were recording the saints of those who profess the truth under the general heading of selfishness came every other sin there were also headings over every column and these opposite each names were recorded in their respective columns the lesser saints so what I wanted you to understand that in this systemation promoting came in other words the system of education the worldly system of education promotes what sin sle can someone overcome sin with that system of education no is very is impossible but the grace of god is sufficient for those we decide to make decision decision. So it is also like this. It is also idol worshiping is also idle worshiing. This takes me to the great green history very fast green very fast. And I'm reading SDP SDP. This is page uh SDP page uh let me get the page page 80. Get this. I was to look at this green history very deeply but time is not going to allow me to give that because I already see I have 40 minutes but I wanted to give a good time to questions and answer this page 181 182 paragraph one says the following I want to be projected to see that system of education is idol woriing you are not woriing god why system ofation However much we come to the church on Sabbath and we go back and we prepare meals on Friday. Hallelujah. I want to see that. I want to see that. 1821 1821 says it says there is a pathetic straight throughout their history. They sympathetic straight throughout their history and their history what Greek history are together. What is the characteristics of Greeks that you know they are speaking for what? Wisdom. Hallelujah. But is there wisdom is if Christ is preached they say that is foolishness foolishness. I mean with you in the book of 1 Corinthians 1:21 23. So the Greeks are only seeking for whistle but they all fruit Christ as for foolishness. Hallelujah. But Christians need to have Christ. Are we together? So there's a pathetic strength throughout their history. They come so close to God. They come so close to God. They come so close to they come so close to the God of whom? Uhhuh. And yet not knowing him. And yet not knowing him. They wandered in such utter darkness. Continuing there is a constant reminder of the faith of those students of today. The Greek history is a constant reminder to the students of whom? They seek to understand natural phenomenal they can explain how much kilaro was formed. Are you they know and they have theories that will explain how the world came to exist exist and they can explain how we have seven continents. Amen. And they know what happened between the seas and the land. They can explain. They want to understand natural what phenomena but do what? Continuing. But do not interpret nature. They do not interpret nature. By the words of his creator. By the words of who? His great. Is great. Hallelujah. In other words, the nature should be interpreted by the words of who? Of creator. And the words of creator is in what? The the Bible. Hallelujah. So people understanding the phenomena without the by the way you cannot stud the Bible they go to you told that heaven is a what is a school nature what listen I read that quotation when I was reading that page 547 says that heaven is a what a school so there's the students of today are desiring to understand phenomena but do not interpret nature by the word of the creator. Now listen to the next statement. Hallelujah. Someone who is tired get this next statement. It says they worship who? Zeus and Pluto Pluto instead of instead of the Christ. So if you are answering questions in you idol worship. Yes. The Bible will tell you that you cannot worship two people. No one can serve what two masters. Amen. So when you are coming to the church but in the other hand you what you need to know that you have one master. Are we together? So it is idol should be continue reading the fact that the children of today the fact that the children of today upon myths and tradition of this are fed upon myth and tradition of this very in darkness gods of Olympus and ignorant of God whose shoot the mountains against whose smile was sanding Uh-huh. And whoever the fields, the Greeks, the Greeksh were they accepted the sacrifice of the slain of the lamb of God. Greeks offered what? But we are asked that what value of their sacrifice if they rejected the lamb of God. The system of education today people sacrifice. Amen. And they give offerings that to do what to sacrifice continually saying the spirit of prophecy the spirit of prophecy was cherished was cherished but when God's prophet made the But while God's prophet mingled with the three people, the Greek prophet secluded from the peopleh. Amen. So I don't want you to know that today I'm praying to worship God. Amen. That will be my call. This week is a week of making and we are told that when a call is made and you make a step forward and God is going to give you angels to go to. Amen. So we have people in the in the Bible. We have people in the Bible of whom the word of God was studied. The last we saw in the education of Moses. I want just to reiterate this that Moses studied in who school? In the schools of Egypt. Are we together? And Moses studied very great topics. We saw that Moses was a philosopher. He was a poet. He was a mathematician. And we were told that Moses used to call what? And used to score airplanes not airplanes but when God called Moses he had to under system to get education. Hallelujah. He has to go to God's universe. Hallelujah. Amen. And we are also told not only that I want to read for last one quotation that will summarize the education and last we also saw when they were answering a question a brother asked we realized that there were also schools of prophets in which Daniel's friends to obtain their what education and the education was very high more than the education that was provided in the universities and colleges of what United you reading it again very fast then we come to something I'm just next to coming to the end of my I want to give you time to answer questions the place of Bible 8 page 80 this is a book written by also Trevor a pioneer of 7th Adventist. Now this is page 80 paragraph one project that you see this the schools of the prophets there were schools of the prophets at the same time there also schools of the palants now look at the education that was in the schools of the prophets is it there from the specification distinct remain in the scripture from the specification decision made in the scripture from the product that must be passed. It is certain that all we have of life must comprehend the requirements of the king's respect of the king respecting the youth who are to beh and this no small tribute is no small tribute to the educational ideas of king indeed his views of education in this verse as soon in this verse I'm talking Daniel chapter one chapter one from verse four in this verse of the Bible in this verse of the Bible for all practical purposes for in advance for in advance of the educational system that prevents people the kind of the people that require the education was advanced more than the education that people acquire today today today. Hallelujah. Daniel was very wise. Amen. He was very wise and he qualified to be chosen to serve at the king's what palace. Are we together? Now continue reading even in the living colleges. That prevents even the living and universities. The living is universities where United States not even amened what United States. Amen. That is the wherein that proceed in the paragraph that is paragraph three. It says, it says Daniel, where did Daniel and his three companions and his three companions obtain the education which enable them successfully which enable them successfully to pass the examination to pass the examination require that exist of the leading the leading of United where can that education be acquired? them and education which made them skillful and knowledge and understanding science and understanding what science science and which gave them ability and which they gave them ability in all the things withoutation it can be answered but but I like that place I like that place I want you to see But you see people today are talking of the education. You see these things or these things and maybe education of the world. You see this this cameras, this laptop and and we said last time that not every knowledge is from the what? We realize that Satan with and when God has given a knowledge that will help in the taking the gospel of the message people has to accept that knowledge. Are you so I will read your quotation that says that whosoever staples this conviction because it is what inclinations will soon fail to determine between truth and you are my light no without education can be answered it can be answered in the school of the prophets. In the schools of the what? The prophets. He established school in there was at that time there was at that time a school a school of schools of the prophets in Jerusalem in Jerusalem. Hallelujah. So there were schools of the prophets in Jerusalem. Amen. And you remember during the time when the sons of the prophets were going to cut what? Trees. Where were they? In the school of the prophets. Amen. And they were going to build what classics. Amen. They were going to build classes. Where the hallelujah. So green fields, green history will change you. There is something. Have you ever known why there's a a gap between and have you ever known why a gap that is between Greek history that Greek history answers that then I'm looking just example of Christ I'm giving you time for questions 19 get this Get this why there is an ass time between Malachi and the book of Matthew SDP the page is 190 paragraph this will tell you about the issue that has happened what God had given to his people and what is happening in this last days it says 192 this one is wasting now time let me use this for it has that the inoc the time between the prophecy of Malachi between the prophecy of Malachi and John the Baptist and John the Baptist when is John the history of John the Baptist beginning in the book of Mark Matthew Are you yes continue reading we are now ready we are now ready to appreciate the reason to appreciate The reason Israel why Israel so long was so long without the sound without the sound of the prophet's voice of the prophet's voice God God is a communication system of what education hallelujah how many are seeing the history of the Greece how it appeared in God's word look at this God gave Israel a sense of what education separate and distinct from the system of all other nations. Nations. Hallelujah. So could Israel go to other system of other nations? No. of today. Amen. And we will be putting that verse that is first that we are the people what nations. Uhhuh. Chosen. Chosen what? Is a chosen what? So if the chosen generation seventh day adventist today, God is a separate and distinct the system of all other nation. A system continue a system which ifever would forever make it impossible make it impossible for the people for the people to go into. So they were following it says it says but Israel but Israel gave up a god-given system for teaching for the teaching nation of the hidden what nations. Next it says look at that very painful that however much God gave them a system that was different from all other nations but they gave up to the teachings of other what nations are together they went to another system of what education they copied other nations and allow me tell you how many have ever read the book of numbers chapter 25 chapter 25 what is happening in numbers chapter 25 numbers numbers chapter 25 it was even presented Yeah. Ecumenical movement. Ecumenical what? Movement. Do you know the tribe in Israel that led that? The tribe in that was the tribe of Robert. What to birth? What is the birth of education? The science of what? Education. So we are going to join movement after doing what? Selling our birthight. You go to cross and shadow page 288. That one we read paragraph 3. Go to paragraph 4. Read the next you realize that the tribe of the women were the people who went and choose and stay next to Moabites. Are you together? And by that they selling their what? Their so people are going to sell your true science of others. Okay. If we go to the system of other other gods and other gods today, tell me a school today where one god is taught the schools of the world. We are going to go to captivity and number 25 is going to repeat itself itself. It continuc religion. Hallelujah. No one can go to that education and come up with a pure mind. You know that are also using that verse. I always read you that it is only that time is limited. The first principles of the child. If you turn up a child from 1 to 12 years you will forever. That is what are saying that is written in fundamental of education where books reading go and get that book to read. You see today elders are coming some elders some are coming and say train up a child. So if you are doing with them they will not do what this is worshiping of God but when they went to they came up with religion. But let me ask you those who obtained their education in the schools of the prophets like Daniel were they simulated with that system of education? No. Were they impressed by that religion? No. When you teach Daniel chapter 3, they refused to bow down what to the idol. Are you so going to under go the beast and let the change and the grace of God be sufficient to the unto them. Hallelujah. Somebody is sleeping in this class. Just wake up a man. The grace of God is sufficient to those who sleeping. Hallelujah. So it continues by saying I won't finish. It continues by saying uh Jews return from Babylon. Jews return from Babylon. Babylonian ideas of education and religion. This prepared them with readiness. The teaching of the the teachings of the Greeks. A question. What have we read that the teaching of the Greek is leading to? I do not. I I when somebody is trying to understand phenomena of the earth without the Bible in that age. So they were able to accept the teachings of the Greek. The Greeks continually from Malachi of John the Baptist. family go and read others for yourself. Amen. Amen. By the way, what made you follow the system? But you know, God has arrived to do what worship him. So there were those who remained and remain steadfast to the system. I'm looking up Christ as an example. Then I'm giving time for prayers. Christ as an example. The book of that is first Peter 2 verse 21. The Bible says the following words 2 verse 21 says the Bible reads the reads uh 2 2 Uh-huh. Because Uh-huh. Because Christ also suffered for us. Because Christ also suffered for us. Living as an example. Living as an example. That you should follow. That you should follow what? Yes. That Christ left an example that you should follow what? First John 2 verse 6. It says, It says John 2 verse 6. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. He that he abideth in him. He that he abideth in himself to walk even walk as he walk. Hallelujah. How many love that verse? How many love that verse? And when you can preach that verse, you will talk of Christ humility. Hallelujah. You talk of Christ kindness. Amen. Will you mention that in that verse? Hallelujah. Amen. Will you mention those? But people always mention the Christ. Do we always mention the Christ? But what the Bible says is that we read again. It says it says he that abided him abided in him. God himself to walk him even as he walked. All you want to say so Christ, you talk of Christ, you talk of Christ, you talk of Christy, you talk of Christ verse 28, the Bible say the mans And when they saw him, And when they saw him, they were amazed. They were amazed. And his mother said unto him, And his mother said unto him, Son, why this the Bible? It says, son, why hast thou dealt with us? Behold, thy father and household this. Uhhuh. I'm checking the verse where it says that and the child grew 40. The Bible says the child and the child grew what strong in spirit and what strong in spirit that is Jesus Christ filled with wisdom. Filled with what? Wisdom. Filled with what? Wisdom. Wisdom. And the grace of God was upon you. And the grace of God was upon him. Christ was also filled with what? Wisdom. He now Christ was is our example. And if you're buying in Christ, we need to follow the step of Christ. Look at this. I'm reading this pages page 9 page 7 69 paragraph 3 then I paragraph one then I pray listen to the following words in the in the name of Christ for religious instruction for that that did not provide for religious instruction of the young regard was regarded under of God. Next statement had become for tradition in a great degree supplanted supplanted what? The script. That is the name of Christ. That tradition supplanted the what? The script. Hallelujah. So the only thing that could be lifted is tradition more than script scriptures. Uhhuh. [Music] by these teachers. But the next paragon receive instruction in the synagogue in the synagogue schools in the synagogue schools. His mother was his first human was his first human teacher from the scorn of the mother the mother of Jesus used the syllabus of the education of the prop the schools of the prop the same thing that was taught to Daniel was taught to whom Christ amen that is why Christ was very very wise his wisdom exceeded the wisdom of the universities of United States. Amen. My time is running fast. I want to stop. Amen. So this subject is some sometimes interesting that I begin reading something. I realize that time man. Amen. But God may God be the help follow Christ before those who successfully mission movement in Jesus name. Amen. Allow me then I need time for questions. I'm praying. Thank you for the system education that you given to the Israelites. We also were able to study and their wisdom exed all other wisdom that could be in the world. That is the wisdom we require today as people to make sure that we have a character paid for it. Help us dear Lord in heaven to make a step of faith to do the call that you're doing over us to education. Dear all heaven as you shall be looking other things are to be established. God we pray that you may help us have a people who are going to stand for this for I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.",
        "timestamped_transcript": "[2.0s] I'm also a lover of\n[4.3s] history and when church was being\n[7.0s] presented I was in Christ by something\n[10.2s] that I want to read\n[12.8s] uh I said that I have to read this month\n[14.9s] before this congregation before I go\n[16.6s] into the\n[17.9s] subject moment I'm reading in\n[22.5s] three three\n[24.7s] Bible page 174 when the teacher\n[28.8s] of church. He was talking about somebody\n[32.1s] called James White. I said that I had to\n[35.0s] read this thing before this congregation\n[36.8s] because I loved the characteristics of\n[39.4s] James White and the God is calling for\n[41.9s] James White in the last days to be able\n[44.4s] to carry on the work\n[47.3s] uh the work that the Lord has left us.\n[50.1s] That is the work of preaching the news\n[53.0s] message. There is three bio three\n[55.8s] biography 4 paragraph 36 I'm commenting\n[60.2s] about what the teacher said about James\n[61.9s] White and I'm going to read the funeral\n[65.8s] program of James White when he died in\n[68.3s] 188\n[70.4s] what James White\n[73.4s] died 18 which\n[77.0s] month which date fixed you need to know\n[81.6s] that now this is Smith who was the\n[84.2s] secretary of the general conference when\n[86.6s] James went was working. Uh 374 paragraph\n[90.6s] 6 says Smith enumerated in some detail\n[93.8s] giving illustrations predominating\n[96.3s] traits and characteristics of a man with\n[99.1s] whom he had worked intimately for so\n[102.0s] many years. We first noticed that in the\n[105.3s] times of confusion and excitement he was\n[108.2s] what? Always calm and cool. Are we\n[111.8s] together? That is the first\n[113.2s] characteristics of who? James White. In\n[115.7s] times of confusion, James White was\n[118.2s] always calm and what? And cool. We are\n[121.4s] told. Secondly, he was a man never given\n[123.9s] to what fanatism. Number three, he was\n[128.2s] thirdly, he was endured with remarkable\n[131.8s] acuteness of perception to determine the\n[135.8s] most delicious moves to be made.\n[138.5s] Hallelujah. Those are characteristics of\n[140.9s] whom James went. Fourthly, he was a man\n[144.5s] who would never to discuss\n[146.7s] discouragement. And I love that the word\n[149.9s] fail was not in his what? Vocabul.\n[153.8s] Hallelujah. God is calling for him today\n[157.0s] who can never what? Discouragement.\n[160.0s] Amen. And I see him in the meeting.\n[163.0s] There are people here the word fail\n[165.2s] cannot be what vocabulary. Fifthly, he\n[169.1s] was a man who looked forward to the\n[171.3s] future ones of his work and make\n[173.2s] provision for them. He foraw that\n[175.5s] certain elements stability of stability\n[178.3s] must be wrote into the work which could\n[180.8s] be secured only through what?\n[183.7s] Organization. Sixthly, he was a man of\n[186.9s] strong personal apprentip of a\n[189.0s] remarkably generous nature to have a\n[191.8s] regard for the interest of others and to\n[195.0s] see that their circumstances were\n[197.0s] rendered as favorable as possible was a\n[200.4s] part of his name. Amen. So I love those\n[203.8s] characteristics of James White. And when\n[206.1s] the teacher was speaking about James\n[207.6s] White, I was very impressed by that\n[210.1s] point and I say I had to read it. But I\n[212.9s] said that the James White of the last\n[215.6s] days are going to die up early. And if\n[219.8s] they are not if they don't die early, it\n[221.8s] means that they're not what working. I'm\n[225.0s] still contemplating upon that. If you\n[227.4s] are against wife in the congregation, do\n[229.7s] meditate upon that. May God bless the\n[232.0s] teacher\n[232.9s] of we shall be talking about that. I\n[236.1s] know that the Lord has led us in the\n[238.6s] past we don't fear for the people for\n[241.0s] the future. Amen. So welcome again to\n[243.4s] the class of\n[246.4s] education educator. This class I look on\n[249.8s] very few things. This class I'm going to\n[252.4s] give much time for question and answer\n[255.8s] because I only have two classes that is\n[257.8s] remaining. In my next class I'll be\n[260.5s] looking away for a solution in regation\n[264.3s] and that is what we had looking when\n[266.9s] last we about the one aim of the purple\n[271.5s] systemation I realize that the aim of\n[273.9s] the purple system is to do what to\n[276.8s] overthrow\n[278.0s] what to overthrow protestantism I don't\n[281.8s] know how to say that is in his way but I\n[284.5s] know that the first aim of the purple\n[287.7s] and the system of education is to make\n[290.2s] sure that protestants are destroyed.\n[293.6s] Realize that papacy does this through\n[296.6s] the order of Jesuits. Are we together?\n[300.3s] When was the order of J established?\n[307.9s] when by\n[311.6s] whom\n[315.3s] somebody of them can apply and we have\n[318.1s] controversy in 234 told us that what\n[321.2s] they do is that they what\n[326.8s] they are together they don't visit\n[330.4s] schools they don't say they establish\n[332.7s] schools but they They invented the war\n[335.5s] or dolls prisons get the poor. But for\n[339.8s] the young children they do what? They\n[342.9s] they established schools for the what\n[345.0s] for the common people and the colleges\n[348.1s] for the children of the princess and by\n[351.0s] that the children of Protestants were\n[354.1s] drawn into the observance of popish what\n[357.8s] popish\n[358.8s] right that was southern soldiers that\n[363.1s] the best way to control protestants is\n[366.5s] just to control their\n[374.7s] education.\n[376.3s] Education examples remaining 14. What\n[379.8s] made me the declaration of the United\n[381.4s] Nations is that they never understood\n[384.0s] the true science of what? Education.\n[386.8s] Hallelujah. And therefore seventh day\n[389.0s] adventist that was to them an example.\n[392.3s] Those things were written that they need\n[394.2s] to be a what? An example that this last\n[396.7s] days if are not going to understand the\n[400.5s] two sides of education their information\n[403.1s] are not going\n[405.1s] for because they realize that the\n[407.8s] message and the two\n[421.1s] of\n[422.8s] the two\n[433.5s] And he also realized that the education\n[436.2s] is the birthight of\n[439.2s] what of information on a man and I was\n[442.5s] very happy when the teacher of church\n[445.2s] heritage was also saying that what is\n[446.9s] the catalyst of\n[448.4s] information the catalyst\n[454.3s] Who are these people in the class? What\n[456.6s] is the catalyst of reformation? Well,\n[458.8s] you will tell them the catalyst of\n[460.8s] reformation is publishing house. And we\n[463.5s] saw that the present true publishing\n[465.6s] house was established in\n[467.5s] year but you were in class\n[475.8s] and\n[477.3s] 1850\n[480.9s] go. So the catalyst of information is\n[483.7s] republic publishing. The path right and\n[487.0s] what strengthens the information is\n[489.7s] through science of educate education\n[492.1s] while the right arm of the gospel\n[493.8s] becomes the what medical missionary.\n[496.4s] Amen. So those three things that is that\n[499.8s] we have to maintain our what publishing\n[502.2s] ourselves\n[504.4s] schools is going to restaurants.\n[508.8s] Hallelujah. You will only establish\n[511.2s] restaurants after establishing house as\n[514.1s] an school. Hallelujah. Don't run for a\n[517.0s] restaurant before even establishing one\n[519.4s] school. Amen. Say amen.\n[523.8s] Hallelujah. P the\n[526.2s] B is for information then the right arm\n[529.4s] that is missionary then you can go for a\n[531.7s] restaurant. Amen. So in this class I'm\n[533.8s] going to give very brief notes very\n[536.7s] brief. and try to be brief and give time\n[540.4s] for more questions. Now last time we\n[542.4s] left at the point where we say that we\n[544.7s] need schools that are going to repudiate\n[547.6s] the principles of purpose. Hallelujah.\n[552.0s] I'll take from that in the next class\n[555.1s] and we'll see how to establish\n[558.5s] schools, what is to be taught in the\n[561.3s] schools and also the selection of\n[564.8s] teachers to teach in the world in the\n[568.0s] schools. Are we together? So that I want\n[570.1s] to preserve for the next lesson and my\n[572.5s] last lesson the topic of my last lesson\n[575.0s] will be you must be able to decide for\n[579.4s] himself. Amen. So if the question that\n[583.2s] we'll be having that be we'll be\n[585.8s] touching on the how to establish schools\n[589.4s] what is to be taught in schools and the\n[591.5s] selection of teachers you can preserve\n[593.8s] that question for the next class but\n[595.9s] today I'm going to give generally the\n[598.7s] questions of all the studies that I've\n[600.9s] been having in this class. If you had a\n[603.1s] question, kindly prepare your question\n[605.1s] because I'm going to eat time. But as\n[607.0s] for now, I want to begin giving the\n[608.9s] characteristics of true and the true\n[612.1s] education and the characteristics of\n[614.3s] worldly system education. Then I give a\n[616.7s] few\n[620.5s] a very brief then I look at two examples\n[624.7s] only two examples. I look at Christ\n[627.4s] today and look at the Greek history very\n[630.6s] brief. then I'll be able to finish my\n[632.5s] presentation. I'll be very brief. Now\n[634.1s] write characteristics of true and false\n[636.7s] system of education. Then we begin with\n[638.3s] false system education. The book of\n[640.1s] James 3:3 is what are beginning to read\n[643.4s] is there is where we are going to pick\n[645.2s] our characteristics and see them very\n[647.9s] fast. Somebody is there to help me read.\n[650.8s] Brother God pray you can just come and\n[652.5s] sit here use a microphone to help me\n[654.7s] read these things very fast. And you\n[657.0s] will also help me project the quotations\n[659.0s] because those who are sitting there is\n[661.0s] like they have gone for a short break\n[663.2s] and they are coming back. So you can\n[665.0s] fill that position. James 3 and the 13\n[669.3s] the Bible\n[670.8s] says\n[673.2s] hallelujah 3:1 and you also take your\n[677.0s] book and write the following. The Bible\n[678.6s] says\n[680.0s] James says James 3:3 The Bible says if\n[684.5s] you have But if you have bitter envy\n[688.5s] and strive in your heart not do not\n[693.2s] glory not lie not against and lie not\n[696.7s] against the truth. This wisdom the\n[699.2s] wisdom that comprises of envy and strife\n[703.4s] descended not from above. It descended\n[705.9s] not from above. And it is earthly it is\n[709.0s] earthly sensual sensual and devilish and\n[712.1s] devilish and we saw that that the first\n[714.2s] method of the district system of\n[715.8s] education is to make\n[718.0s] people complete so\n[721.4s] right of systemation number one it it\n[725.6s] comprises of beta envy it comprises of\n[729.1s] beta envy somebody's looking at the wall\n[732.6s] thinking that they're being projected\n[734.4s] I'm not going to project them let me\n[736.3s] Just read them for you in this laptop\n[737.8s] and write them. It comprises of beta\n[740.4s] environ. Number two, it promotes strife\n[743.9s] in the heart. It promotes strife in the\n[748.0s] heart. Number three, it does not descend\n[750.7s] from\n[754.7s] above. Number two, promote strength in\n[757.8s] the heart. Promote strength in the\n[760.7s] heart.\n[767.1s] promote strive in the\n[776.4s] heart. The next says it, it does not\n[780.4s] descend from\n[782.6s] above. Amen.\n[786.5s] In other words, it does not descend from\n[788.0s] the father. In the book of John 8:44, we\n[792.0s] tell you that anything that does not\n[794.4s] desend from the father comes from who?\n[796.9s] Satan. Amen. Anything false is satanic.\n[801.1s] Amen. So it does not descend from above.\n[804.2s] It is earthly. It is\n[808.3s] earthly. It is earthly. That is number\n[811.7s] four. Number five, it is sensual.\n[815.8s] It is\n[818.4s] sensual. Number\n[820.8s] five, it\n[822.7s] is\n[825.6s] satanic stroke.\n[828.6s] Demonic stroke\n[832.3s] delish. In other words, put in\n[836.0s] bracket. It makes people\n[840.4s] worship us.\n[844.0s] It is a\n[845.2s] satanic paganism, demonic, devilish.\n[847.8s] Those are the same\n[849.2s] things. I'm going to the characteristics\n[851.4s] of education the book of James chapter\n[853.4s] 3. You\n[854.8s] proceed I'll\n[864.3s] try read the Bible. Uh\n[867.7s] 3 verse number 15. The Bible says this\n[871.2s] wisdom this wisdom descendant from\n[873.4s] above. It does not descend from above\n[876.8s] it is sensual and deish those ones we\n[881.1s] have written that is the characteristics\n[882.8s] of purple system education and world\n[884.5s] system education or you can still write\n[887.0s] system of education but realize that we\n[889.5s] have another kind of education. Now you\n[892.4s] can also write characteristics of true\n[895.4s] education. characteristics of truth\n[898.3s] education.\n[901.8s] Philippians 3 16 the Bible says it says\n[906.5s] from ending and strife is there is\n[910.3s] confusion and every evil one but the\n[914.6s] wisdom that is from above the wisdom\n[917.1s] that is from above that is first the\n[919.7s] first characteristic of true education\n[921.8s] it descendeth from above write that it\n[925.6s] descendeth from above it is godly it is\n[929.0s] godly and promotes Christianity Write\n[931.8s] that statement that way. It descended\n[934.2s] from above. It is godly and promotes\n[941.2s] Christianity. Number two, it is\n[945.0s] pure. I think the book of James chapter\n[948.2s] 3 has been projected. It is pure. It is\n[951.8s] pure. In other words, no unnecessary\n[954.6s] knowledge. We realize that in the world\n[956.6s] of education there are necessary what?\n[959.3s] Knowledge. Amen. And there are things\n[961.7s] that are taught that should not be\n[963.0s] taught to Christians today. Today today\n[966.2s] no unnecessary there's no no any\n[968.9s] unnecessary knowledge. Number three, it\n[971.0s] is peaceable. It is\n[973.3s] peaceable. Write very fast. Write very\n[975.8s] fast. Time is running. I want to write\n[978.4s] very fast. It is\n[980.4s] peaceable. It is\n[983.6s] gentle. It is peaceable. It is\n[986.3s] gentle. It is easily treated.\n[991.6s] Somebody saw that easily in\n[995.6s] treated full of\n[998.4s] m is full of\n[1001.1s] nami. It is full of good fruits.\n[1017.2s] It is easily\n[1019.4s] intreated. It is\n[1021.5s] easily\n[1024.8s] intreated. It is full of\n[1029.5s] mer. Full of good\n[1034.3s] fruits. Full of mer. Full of good\n[1037.3s] fruits. without\n[1044.8s] partiality, without hypocrisy. Realize\n[1047.6s] that the worst of education is\n[1050.3s] hypocrisy. It is a form of godliness.\n[1053.7s] You pretend to be loving God, but unite\n[1056.3s] them in\n[1058.1s] works. Without hypocrisy, the fruit of\n[1062.0s] righteousness is sown in its principle.\n[1066.3s] The fields of righteousness is in\n[1072.9s] every characteristics of truth\n[1076.1s] education. Amen. Amen.\n[1080.2s] Education and we say that that is the\n[1082.8s] monique. I'm giving two aims of system\n[1085.9s] education two only. The rest you will go\n[1088.8s] and study for yourself. My first point\n[1091.1s] from the Sabbath was that\n[1094.0s] it it aim is to overthrow what?\n[1096.8s] Protestantism. Number two, write this\n[1099.5s] number two. So if you're writing your I\n[1103.0s] know you write notes on the so if you\n[1105.7s] want to write them just write a\n[1108.4s] purposes then you write continuation\n[1111.5s] then you just write number two are\n[1114.5s] you\n[1119.3s] think it proves the Bible to be error\n[1122.9s] and a\n[1123.7s] theory it proves the Bible to be\n[1126.8s] error and a theory. There was a\n[1129.0s] quotation by was read that was read by\n[1131.4s] brother Neon I think it was ministry of\n[1135.0s] it should be page 443 maybe I'm going to\n[1138.0s] check the page I give but it says that\n[1140.1s] philosophical speculation and scientific\n[1142.7s] research philosophical speculation and\n[1145.4s] scientific research in which God is not\n[1149.7s] acknowledged are making skeptics of\n[1152.9s] thousands in the schools of today the\n[1156.0s] conclusion that learned men have reached\n[1157.9s] as the result of their scientific\n[1159.7s] investigation are carefully taught and\n[1161.9s] fully explained while the impression is\n[1164.7s] distinctly given that if these learned\n[1167.6s] men are correct the Bible cannot be\n[1172.1s] hallelujah hallelujah so we are told\n[1175.0s] that the theories that are taught in\n[1176.6s] school today evolution if they can be\n[1179.0s] correct then the Bible cannot be correct\n[1182.6s] so one of the aim of the purple\n[1184.9s] education is that it proves the Bible to\n[1188.2s] be error and a theory. So that is why\n[1191.7s] today it makes people not study the\n[1193.8s] Bible because they believe that is an\n[1196.2s] error. It is just a theory what is\n[1199.6s] believed.\n[1201.2s] Amen. Next aim it promotes a\n[1205.1s] self this what we tackled in our last so\n[1208.9s] I'm going to deal with few examples and\n[1211.8s] give questions to this class.\n[1214.6s] It promotes self the root of all\n[1218.4s] evil. It promotes self the root of evil.\n[1221.0s] Education page 225 paragraph 4.\n[1224.7s] Education\n[1234.6s] 225 education page 2.5 says precious the\n[1240.3s] service done and the education gained in\n[1242.9s] carrying out these principles but how\n[1245.2s] widely different is much of the\n[1247.0s] education now given from the child's\n[1249.5s] earliest years is an appeal of emulation\n[1253.4s] and rivalry\n[1255.1s] of emulation and what that\n[1260.5s] is. So we are told\n[1263.4s] that it fosters\n[1266.4s] selfishness the root of all evil\n[1271.6s] page\n[1275.9s] paragraph 4. It is not from the\n[1278.2s] beginning. It was taken just the last\n[1281.1s] part where it says that precious the\n[1283.3s] service done and the education gained in\n[1285.6s] carrying out the princip this principles\n[1287.6s] but how widely different is much of the\n[1289.4s] education now given from the child's\n[1291.4s] earliest\n[1298.7s] years that fosters selfishness the root\n[1303.2s] of all what all evil allow me repeat\n[1306.7s] this quotation that was uh testing\n[1310.6s] church 3 page 384 paragraph 3 I think\n[1315.1s] that is the reputation says the\n[1316.8s] following words\n[1320.8s] 384 paragraph 3 384\n[1329.1s] paragraph number three says it says it\n[1332.0s] says when the lamb and the takes\n[1334.2s] position of the heart and becomes a\n[1337.0s] ruling passion Mhm.\n[1346.6s] That is not what I want. What I want say\n[1349.0s] is under the general heading of\n[1351.1s] selfishness came every other scene. That\n[1353.2s] is what I'm looking for today because\n[1355.8s] the system of education of today\n[1358.0s] strengthens what?\n[1360.4s] Selfishness. Let me check if it is this\n[1362.6s] one.\n[1371.0s] volume 4 paragraph 3 I'm sorry not\n[1375.0s] speech says that another book was opened\n[1378.3s] wherein were recording the saints of\n[1380.1s] those who profess the truth under the\n[1382.2s] general heading of selfishness came\n[1384.3s] every other sin there were also headings\n[1387.0s] over every column and these opposite\n[1390.3s] each names were recorded in their\n[1392.1s] respective columns the lesser saints so\n[1394.6s] what I wanted you to understand that in\n[1397.1s] this systemation\n[1401.6s] promoting\n[1403.6s] came in other words the system of\n[1406.6s] education the worldly system of\n[1409.1s] education promotes what sin\n[1413.7s] sle can someone overcome sin with that\n[1417.4s] system of education no is very is\n[1421.0s] impossible but the grace of god is\n[1423.0s] sufficient for those we decide to make\n[1425.5s] decision decision. So it is also like\n[1428.6s] this. It is also idol worshiping is also\n[1431.3s] idle worshiing. This takes me to the\n[1433.8s] great green history very fast green very\n[1437.0s] fast. And I'm reading\n[1439.7s] SDP SDP. This is page\n[1444.8s] uh SDP page\n[1449.6s] uh let me get the\n[1452.0s] page\n[1454.2s] page\n[1467.0s] 80. Get this. I was to look at this\n[1470.7s] green\n[1471.7s] history very deeply but time is not\n[1474.1s] going to allow me to give that because I\n[1476.4s] already see I have 40 minutes but I\n[1478.5s] wanted to give a good time to questions\n[1480.8s] and answer this page 181 182 paragraph\n[1486.2s] one says the following I want to be\n[1488.5s] projected to see that system of\n[1490.6s] education is idol\n[1494.0s] woriing you are not woriing god why\n[1497.8s] system ofation However much we come to\n[1499.4s] the church on\n[1500.6s] Sabbath and we go back and we prepare\n[1504.2s] meals on\n[1507.7s] Friday. Hallelujah. I want to see that.\n[1511.4s] I want to see that.\n[1515.5s] 1821 1821 says it says there is a\n[1520.0s] pathetic straight throughout their\n[1521.9s] history. They sympathetic straight\n[1524.3s] throughout their history and their\n[1526.5s] history what Greek history are together.\n[1530.3s] What is the characteristics of Greeks\n[1532.2s] that you\n[1533.3s] know they are speaking for what? Wisdom.\n[1537.2s] Hallelujah. But is there wisdom is if\n[1540.2s] Christ is preached they say that is\n[1542.4s] foolishness foolishness. I mean with you\n[1544.6s] in the book of 1 Corinthians 1:21 23. So\n[1547.9s] the Greeks are only seeking for whistle\n[1550.7s] but they all fruit Christ as for\n[1553.8s] foolishness. Hallelujah. But Christians\n[1556.4s] need to have Christ. Are we together? So\n[1559.4s] there's a pathetic strength throughout\n[1561.3s] their history. They come so close to\n[1564.6s] God. They come so close to God. They\n[1568.0s] come so close to they come so close to\n[1571.0s] the God of whom?\n[1573.0s] Uhhuh. And yet not knowing him. And yet\n[1576.0s] not knowing him.\n[1579.9s] They wandered in such utter darkness.\n[1583.8s] Continuing there is a constant reminder\n[1586.9s] of the faith of those students of today.\n[1590.3s] The Greek history is a constant reminder\n[1594.4s] to the students of whom?\n[1599.3s] They seek to understand\n[1603.7s] natural phenomenal they can explain how\n[1606.4s] much kilaro was formed. Are you they\n[1610.1s] know and they have theories that will\n[1612.4s] explain how the world came to exist\n[1614.9s] exist and they can explain how we have\n[1617.2s] seven continents. Amen. And they know\n[1620.6s] what happened between the seas and the\n[1622.7s] land. They can explain. They want to\n[1625.1s] understand natural what phenomena but do\n[1629.6s] what? Continuing. But do not interpret\n[1633.0s] nature. They do not interpret nature. By\n[1636.6s] the words of his creator. By the words\n[1638.8s] of who? His great. Is great. Hallelujah.\n[1641.5s] In other words, the nature should be\n[1644.0s] interpreted by the words of who? Of\n[1646.2s] creator. And the words of creator is in\n[1648.7s] what? The the Bible. Hallelujah. So\n[1651.9s] people understanding the phenomena\n[1653.6s] without the by the way you cannot\n[1659.2s] stud the Bible they go\n[1662.3s] to you told that heaven is a what is a\n[1666.1s] school nature what listen I read that\n[1669.4s] quotation when I was reading that page\n[1672.8s] 547 says that heaven is a what a school\n[1676.1s] so there's the students of today are\n[1678.3s] desiring to understand phenomena but do\n[1680.3s] not interpret nature by the word of the\n[1683.4s] creator. Now listen to the next\n[1684.7s] statement. Hallelujah. Someone who is\n[1687.0s] tired get this next statement. It says\n[1689.6s] they\n[1693.0s] worship who? Zeus and\n[1697.4s] Pluto Pluto\n[1700.6s] instead of instead of the Christ. So if\n[1703.6s] you are answering questions in you idol\n[1706.5s] worship.\n[1717.5s] Yes. The Bible will tell you that you\n[1720.3s] cannot worship two people. No one can\n[1723.0s] serve what two masters. Amen. So when\n[1725.6s] you are coming to the church but in the\n[1727.6s] other hand you what you need to know\n[1730.1s] that you have one\n[1732.4s] master. Are we together? So it is idol\n[1736.4s] should be continue reading the fact that\n[1738.5s] the children of today the fact that the\n[1740.8s] children of today upon myths and\n[1743.6s] tradition of this are fed upon myth and\n[1747.4s] tradition of this very\n[1751.3s] in darkness\n[1753.7s] gods of Olympus and ignorant of God\n[1758.2s] whose shoot the mountains against\n[1761.8s] whose smile was sanding Uh-huh. And\n[1765.5s] whoever the fields,\n[1768.2s] the Greeks, the Greeksh\n[1773.9s] were they accepted the sacrifice of the\n[1776.6s] slain of the lamb of God. Greeks offered\n[1778.9s] what?\n[1780.6s] But we are asked that what value of\n[1785.0s] their sacrifice if they rejected the\n[1787.1s] lamb of God. The system of education\n[1790.1s] today people sacrifice. Amen. And they\n[1794.1s] give\n[1805.2s] offerings that to do what\n[1811.4s] to sacrifice\n[1813.7s] continually saying the spirit of\n[1815.9s] prophecy the spirit of prophecy was\n[1818.0s] cherished was cherished but when God's\n[1820.8s] prophet made the But while God's prophet\n[1823.8s] mingled with the three people,\n[1827.0s] the Greek prophet\n[1833.9s] secluded from the peopleh.\n[1843.4s] Amen. So I don't\n[1846.8s] want you to know\n[1852.1s] that today I'm\n[1854.8s] praying to worship God. Amen. That will\n[1858.6s] be my call. This week is a week of\n[1860.8s] making and we are told that when a call\n[1863.3s] is made and you make a step forward and\n[1864.7s] God is going to give you angels to go\n[1866.7s] to. Amen. So we have people in the in\n[1869.3s] the Bible. We have people in the Bible\n[1871.8s] of whom the word of God was studied. The\n[1876.1s] last we saw in the education of Moses. I\n[1879.8s] want just to reiterate this that Moses\n[1882.7s] studied in who school? In the schools of\n[1886.1s] Egypt. Are we together? And Moses\n[1889.0s] studied very great topics. We saw that\n[1891.2s] Moses was a philosopher. He was a poet.\n[1893.8s] He was a mathematician. And we were told\n[1895.9s] that Moses used to call what?\n[1899.6s] And used to score airplanes not\n[1903.8s] airplanes but when God called Moses he\n[1906.4s] had to under system to get education.\n[1909.2s] Hallelujah. He has to go to God's\n[1913.3s] universe. Hallelujah. Amen. And we are\n[1916.9s] also told not only that I want to read\n[1919.7s] for last one quotation that will\n[1922.0s] summarize the education and last we also\n[1924.9s] saw when they were answering a question\n[1926.8s] a brother asked we realized that there\n[1928.6s] were also schools of prophets in which\n[1931.1s] Daniel's friends to obtain their what\n[1933.8s] education and the education was very\n[1936.1s] high more than the education that was\n[1939.5s] provided in the universities and\n[1941.8s] colleges of what\n[1945.1s] United\n[1948.4s] you reading it\n[1954.0s] again very fast then we come to\n[1956.9s] something I'm just next to coming to the\n[1959.4s] end of my I want to give you time to\n[1961.6s] answer questions the place of Bible\n[1965.7s] 8 page\n[1973.0s] 80 this is a book written by also Trevor\n[1977.8s] a pioneer of 7th Adventist. Now this is\n[1981.5s] page\n[1982.9s] 80 paragraph one project that you see\n[1987.6s] this the schools of the\n[1989.4s] prophets there were schools of the\n[1991.8s] prophets at the same time there also\n[1994.5s] schools of the palants\n[1997.5s] now look at the education that was in\n[1999.6s] the schools of the prophets is it there\n[2005.0s] from the specification distinct remain\n[2007.4s] in the scripture from the specification\n[2009.4s] decision made in the scripture from the\n[2012.6s] product that must be passed. It is\n[2015.6s] certain that all we have of life must\n[2019.7s] comprehend the requirements of the\n[2021.6s] king's respect of the king respecting\n[2025.6s] the youth who are to beh\n[2029.7s] and this no small tribute is no small\n[2033.0s] tribute\n[2035.3s] to the educational ideas\n[2038.3s] of\n[2040.0s] king\n[2041.9s] indeed his views of education\n[2045.4s] in this verse as soon in this verse I'm\n[2047.8s] talking Daniel chapter one chapter one\n[2050.2s] from verse four in this verse of the\n[2053.0s] Bible in this verse of the Bible for all\n[2055.6s] practical purposes for in advance for in\n[2059.2s] advance\n[2061.4s] of the educational system that prevents\n[2067.2s] people the kind of the people that\n[2070.5s] require the education was advanced more\n[2073.9s] than the education that people acquire\n[2076.5s] today today today. Hallelujah. Daniel\n[2079.9s] was very wise. Amen. He was very wise\n[2084.4s] and he qualified to be chosen to serve\n[2087.3s] at the king's what palace. Are we\n[2089.2s] together? Now continue reading even\n[2093.4s] in the living colleges. That prevents\n[2098.0s] even the living and universities. The\n[2101.6s] living is universities where United\n[2104.4s] States not\n[2105.6s] even\n[2108.4s] amened what United States. Amen. That is\n[2112.0s] the wherein that proceed in the\n[2116.3s] paragraph that is paragraph three. It\n[2118.2s] says, it\n[2119.6s] says Daniel, where did Daniel and his\n[2123.2s] three companions and his three\n[2124.8s] companions\n[2126.6s] obtain the education which enable them\n[2128.8s] successfully which enable them\n[2130.6s] successfully to pass the examination to\n[2133.2s] pass the examination\n[2140.1s] require that exist of the leading the\n[2143.4s] leading of United where can that\n[2146.3s] education be acquired?\n[2149.4s] them and education which made them\n[2154.0s] skillful and knowledge and understanding\n[2157.9s] science and understanding what science\n[2159.9s] science and which gave them ability and\n[2162.7s] which they gave them ability\n[2165.6s] in all the things\n[2170.0s] withoutation it can be answered but but\n[2173.3s] I like that place I like that place I\n[2175.4s] want you to see But you see people today\n[2178.1s] are talking of the education.

You see this\n[2183.7s] this cameras, this laptop and and we\n[2187.0s] said last time that not every knowledge\n[2189.4s] is from the what? We realize that Satan\n[2193.4s] with and when God has given a knowledge\n[2196.1s] that will help in the taking the gospel\n[2199.0s] of the message people has to accept that\n[2202.7s] knowledge. Are\n[2204.0s] you\n[2211.3s] so I will read your quotation that says\n[2214.2s] that whosoever staples this conviction\n[2216.5s] because it is what inclinations will\n[2220.0s] soon fail to determine between truth\n[2224.8s] and you are my light no\n[2229.4s] without education can be answered it can\n[2232.4s] be answered in the school of the\n[2234.4s] prophets. In the schools of the what?\n[2237.4s] The prophets.\n[2241.1s] He established school in\n[2244.9s] there was at that time there was at that\n[2247.4s] time a school a school of schools of the\n[2251.3s] prophets in Jerusalem in Jerusalem.\n[2254.0s] Hallelujah. So there were schools of the\n[2256.1s] prophets in\n[2257.6s] Jerusalem. Amen. And you remember during\n[2260.1s] the time when the sons of the prophets\n[2262.1s] were going to cut what? Trees. Where\n[2265.0s] were they? In the school of the\n[2267.8s] prophets. Amen. And they were going to\n[2269.8s] build what classics. Amen. They were\n[2272.5s] going to build classes. Where the\n[2276.0s] hallelujah. So green fields, green\n[2278.3s] history will change you. There is\n[2280.8s] something. Have you ever known why\n[2283.3s] there's a a gap between\n[2287.4s] and have you ever known why a\n[2292.8s] gap that is\n[2299.1s] between Greek history that Greek history\n[2303.9s] answers that then I'm looking just\n[2305.4s] example of Christ I'm giving you time\n[2306.9s] for\n[2307.8s] questions 19 get this Get this why there\n[2311.8s] is an ass time between Malachi and the\n[2314.9s] book of Matthew SDP the page is 190\n[2319.2s] paragraph this will tell you about the\n[2322.6s] issue that has happened what God had\n[2325.4s] given to his people and what is\n[2327.5s] happening in this last days it says 192\n[2334.3s] this one is wasting now time let me use\n[2336.7s] this\n[2338.7s] for it has\n[2341.8s] that the inoc\n[2347.0s] the time between the prophecy of Malachi\n[2349.7s] between the prophecy of Malachi and John\n[2352.9s] the Baptist and John the Baptist when is\n[2355.6s] John the history of John the Baptist\n[2357.0s] beginning in the book of Mark Matthew\n[2359.8s] Are you yes\n[2362.8s] continue reading we are now ready we are\n[2366.2s] now ready to appreciate the reason to\n[2368.8s] appreciate The reason Israel why Israel\n[2373.4s] so long was so long without the sound\n[2377.1s] without the sound of the prophet's voice\n[2379.8s] of the prophet's voice God\n[2383.6s] God is a communication system of what\n[2387.9s] education hallelujah how many are seeing\n[2390.3s] the history of the Greece how it\n[2391.6s] appeared in God's word look at this God\n[2394.2s] gave Israel a sense of what education\n[2397.7s] separate and distinct from the system of\n[2402.3s] all other nations. Nations. Hallelujah.\n[2405.6s] So could Israel go to other system of\n[2408.5s] other nations? No.\n[2419.1s] of\n[2422.0s] today. Amen. And we will be putting that\n[2425.5s] verse that is\n[2427.0s] first that we are the people what\n[2431.2s] nations. Uhhuh. Chosen. Chosen what? Is\n[2435.5s] a chosen what? So if the chosen\n[2437.7s] generation seventh day adventist today,\n[2439.9s] God is a separate and distinct the\n[2443.9s] system of all other nation. A system\n[2448.0s] continue a system which ifever\n[2452.9s] would forever make it impossible make it\n[2455.7s] impossible for the people for the people\n[2458.7s] to go into.\n[2463.6s] So they were following\n[2471.4s] it says it says\n[2474.4s] but Israel but Israel\n[2479.5s] gave up a god-given system for teaching\n[2483.9s] for the teaching nation of the hidden\n[2486.6s] what nations. Next it says look at that\n[2489.9s] very painful that however much God gave\n[2492.2s] them a system that was different from\n[2494.8s] all other nations but they gave up to\n[2497.1s] the teachings of other what nations are\n[2499.9s] together they went to another system of\n[2502.0s] what education they copied other nations\n[2505.3s] and allow me tell you how many have ever\n[2507.7s] read the book of numbers chapter\n[2509.8s] 25 chapter 25 what is happening in\n[2512.1s] numbers chapter 25\n[2514.2s] numbers numbers chapter 25 it was even\n[2516.7s] presented Yeah. Ecumenical movement.\n[2518.8s] Ecumenical what? Movement. Do you know\n[2521.2s] the tribe in Israel that led that?\n[2525.0s] The tribe in that was the tribe of\n[2529.5s] Robert. What to\n[2533.4s] birth? What is the birth of education?\n[2536.5s] The science of what? Education. So we\n[2538.9s] are going to join movement after doing\n[2541.7s] what? Selling our birthight. You go to\n[2544.7s] cross and shadow page 288. That one we\n[2548.0s] read paragraph 3. Go to paragraph 4.\n[2550.5s] Read the next you realize that the tribe\n[2552.6s] of the women were the people who went\n[2555.1s] and choose and stay next to Moabites.\n[2559.6s] Are you together? And by that\n[2563.0s] they selling their what? Their so people\n[2566.8s] are going to sell your true science\n[2569.5s] of others.\n[2574.3s] Okay. If we go to the system of other\n[2578.2s] other gods and other gods\n[2583.7s] today, tell me a school today where one\n[2587.3s] god is taught the schools of the world.\n[2598.8s] We are going to go to captivity and\n[2600.6s] number 25 is going to repeat itself\n[2603.2s] itself. It continuc\n[2629.2s] religion. Hallelujah. No one can go to\n[2631.8s] that education and come up with a\n[2634.1s] pure\n[2638.0s] mind. You know that are also using that\n[2640.8s] verse. I always read you that it is only\n[2642.8s] that time is limited. The first\n[2645.4s] principles of\n[2647.4s] the child. If you turn up a child from 1\n[2650.6s] to 12 years you will\n[2653.2s] forever. That is what are saying that is\n[2656.1s] written in fundamental of education\n[2657.9s] where books reading go and get that book\n[2659.9s] to read. You see today elders are coming\n[2662.2s] some elders some are coming and say\n[2664.6s] train up a child. So if you are doing\n[2666.2s] with them they will not do\n[2670.1s] what this\n[2672.4s] is worshiping of God but when they went\n[2676.4s] to they came up\n[2680.3s] with religion. But let me ask you those\n[2683.7s] who obtained their education in the\n[2685.8s] schools of the prophets like Daniel were\n[2688.6s] they simulated with that system of\n[2690.0s] education? No. Were they impressed by\n[2692.8s] that religion? No. When you teach Daniel\n[2695.8s] chapter 3, they refused to bow down what\n[2699.4s] to the idol. Are you so going to\n[2703.2s] under\n[2704.8s] go the beast and let the change and the\n[2708.2s] grace of God be sufficient to the unto\n[2710.3s] them. Hallelujah. Somebody is sleeping\n[2713.1s] in this class. Just wake up a man. The\n[2716.6s] grace of God is sufficient to those who\n[2718.3s] sleeping. Hallelujah. So it continues by\n[2720.4s] saying I won't finish.\n[2722.6s] It continues by saying uh Jews return\n[2725.8s] from Babylon. Jews return from Babylon.\n[2730.0s] Babylonian ideas of education and\n[2732.9s] religion. This prepared\n[2736.9s] them with readiness. The teaching of the\n[2740.2s] the teachings of the Greeks.\n[2743.3s] A question. What have we read that the\n[2745.5s] teaching of the Greek is leading to? I\n[2748.1s] do\n[2749.4s] not. I I when somebody is trying to\n[2753.4s] understand phenomena of the earth\n[2755.3s] without the\n[2763.7s] Bible in\n[2766.0s] that age. So they were able to accept\n[2769.8s] the teachings of the Greek. The Greeks\n[2791.7s] continually from\n[2794.4s] Malachi of John the Baptist.\n[2797.8s] family\n[2807.2s] go and read others for yourself. Amen.\n[2809.7s] Amen. By the\n[2811.6s] way, what made\n[2815.5s] you follow the\n[2817.8s] system? But you\n[2819.9s] know, God has arrived to do what worship\n[2824.7s] him. So there were those who remained\n[2827.3s] and remain steadfast to the system. I'm\n[2830.2s] looking up Christ as an example. Then\n[2832.0s] I'm giving time for prayers. Christ as\n[2834.1s] an example. The book of that is first\n[2836.6s] Peter 2 verse 21. The Bible says the\n[2839.9s] following\n[2843.0s] words 2 verse 21 says the Bible reads\n[2847.4s] the\n[2849.9s] reads uh 2\n[2854.0s] 2 Uh-huh. Because Uh-huh. Because Christ\n[2857.8s] also suffered for us. Because Christ\n[2859.7s] also suffered for us. Living as an\n[2861.8s] example. Living as an example. That you\n[2864.9s] should follow. That you should follow\n[2867.1s] what? Yes. That Christ left an example\n[2869.6s] that you should follow what?\n[2876.8s] First John 2 verse 6.\n[2882.0s] It says, It says John 2 verse 6. Uh-huh.\n[2887.0s] Uh-huh. He that he abideth in him. He\n[2889.9s] that he abideth in\n[2892.0s] himself to walk\n[2895.1s] even walk as he walk. Hallelujah. How\n[2899.0s] many love that\n[2900.4s] verse? How many love that verse? And\n[2903.3s] when you can preach that verse, you will\n[2905.5s] talk of Christ humility. Hallelujah. You\n[2909.2s] talk of Christ kindness. Amen.\n[2912.8s] Will you mention that in that verse?\n[2915.8s] Hallelujah. Amen. Will you mention\n[2917.8s] those? But people always mention the\n[2923.8s] Christ. Do we always mention the Christ?\n[2927.4s] But what the Bible says is that we read\n[2930.6s] again. It says it says he that abided\n[2935.5s] him abided in him. God himself to walk\n[2938.9s] him even as he walked.\n[2940.5s] All you want to say so\n[2944.4s] Christ, you talk of Christ, you talk of\n[2948.4s] Christ, you talk of\n[2950.6s] Christy, you talk of\n[2958.8s] Christ verse\n[2966.2s] 28, the Bible say the mans\n[2970.4s] And when they saw him, And when they saw\n[2972.6s] him, they were amazed. They were amazed.\n[2974.7s] And his mother said unto him, And his\n[2976.5s] mother said unto him, Son, why\n[2980.6s] this the Bible? It says, son, why hast\n[2984.4s] thou dealt with us? Behold, thy father\n[2987.7s] and household this. Uhhuh. I'm checking\n[2991.0s] the verse where it says that and the\n[2992.5s] child grew 40. The Bible says the child\n[2996.2s] and the child grew what strong in spirit\n[2998.6s] and what strong in spirit that is Jesus\n[3001.5s] Christ filled with wisdom. Filled with\n[3003.8s] what? Wisdom. Filled with what? Wisdom.\n[3006.3s] Wisdom. And the grace of God was upon\n[3008.7s] you. And the grace of God was upon him.\n[3011.8s] Christ was also filled with what?\n[3013.5s] Wisdom. He now Christ was is our\n[3017.1s] example. And if you're buying in Christ,\n[3019.0s] we need to follow the step of Christ.\n[3021.5s] Look at this. I'm reading this\n[3024.3s] pages page 9 page 7 69 paragraph 3 then\n[3028.9s] I paragraph one then I pray listen to\n[3032.0s] the following\n[3036.6s] words in the in the name of\n[3042.9s] Christ for religious instruction for\n[3045.7s] that that did not provide for religious\n[3048.3s] instruction of the young regard\n[3051.2s] was regarded\n[3052.8s] under of God. Next\n[3058.0s] statement had become for\n[3062.0s] tradition in a great degree supplanted\n[3065.6s] supplanted what? The script. That is the\n[3068.2s] name of Christ. That tradition\n[3070.9s] supplanted the what? The script.\n[3073.4s] Hallelujah. So the only thing that could\n[3075.1s] be lifted\n[3076.3s] is tradition more than script\n[3078.9s] scriptures. Uhhuh.\n[3087.9s] [Music]\n[3089.8s] by these teachers. But the next paragon\n[3098.7s] receive instruction in the synagogue in\n[3101.8s] the synagogue schools in the synagogue\n[3103.6s] schools. His mother was his first human\n[3106.2s] was his first human teacher from the\n[3110.6s] scorn of\n[3112.8s] the mother the mother of Jesus used the\n[3116.2s] syllabus of the education of the prop\n[3118.4s] the schools of the prop the same thing\n[3120.5s] that was taught to Daniel was taught to\n[3122.5s] whom Christ amen that is why Christ was\n[3126.2s] very very\n[3127.6s] wise his wisdom exceeded the wisdom of\n[3132.5s] the universities of United States. Amen.\n[3135.4s] My time is running fast. I want to stop.\n[3137.8s] Amen. So this subject is some sometimes\n[3140.6s] interesting that I begin reading\n[3142.6s] something. I realize that time man.\n[3144.6s] Amen. But God may God be the help follow\n[3148.0s] Christ before those who successfully\n[3151.0s] mission movement in Jesus name. Amen.\n[3153.8s] Allow me then I need time for questions.\n[3156.6s] I'm praying.\n[3168.0s] Thank you for the system education that\n[3170.8s] you given to the\n[3173.8s] Israelites.\n[3175.3s] We also were able to study and their\n[3178.6s] wisdom exed all other wisdom that could\n[3181.1s] be in the world. That is the wisdom we\n[3183.8s] require today as people to make sure\n[3187.4s] that we have a character paid for it.\n[3190.1s] Help us dear Lord in heaven to make a\n[3192.6s] step of\n[3194.5s] faith to\n[3196.4s] do the call that you're doing over us to\n[3199.6s] education. Dear all heaven as you shall\n[3201.9s] be looking other things are to be\n[3203.9s] established. God we pray that you may\n[3206.2s] help us have a people who are going to\n[3208.9s] stand for this for I pray in Jesus name.\n[3212.0s] Amen. Amen."

        "full_transcript": "I'm also a lover of history and when church was being presented I was in Christ by something that I want to read uh I said that I have to read this month before this congregation before I go into the subject moment I'm reading in three three Bible page 174 when the teacher of church. He was talking about somebody called James White. I said that I had to read this thing before this congregation because I loved the characteristics of James White and the God is calling for James White in the last days to be able to carry on the work uh the work that the Lord has left us. That is the work of preaching the news message. There is three bio three biography 4 paragraph 36 I'm commenting about what the teacher said about James White and I'm going to read the funeral program of James White when he died in 188 what James White died 18 which month which date fixed you need to know that now this is Smith who was the secretary of the general conference when James went was working. Uh 374 paragraph 6 says Smith enumerated in some detail giving illustrations predominating traits and characteristics of a man with whom he had worked intimately for so many years. We first noticed that in the times of confusion and excitement he was what? Always calm and cool. Are we together? That is the first characteristics of who? James White. In times of confusion, James White was always calm and what? And cool. We are told. Secondly, he was a man never given to what fanatism. Number three, he was thirdly, he was endured with remarkable acuteness of perception to determine the most delicious moves to be made. Hallelujah. Those are characteristics of whom James went. Fourthly, he was a man who would never to discuss discouragement. And I love that the word fail was not in his what? Vocabul. Hallelujah. God is calling for him today who can never what? Discouragement. Amen. And I see him in the meeting. There are people here the word fail cannot be what vocabulary. Fifthly, he was a man who looked forward to the future ones of his work and make provision for them. He foraw that certain elements stability of stability must be wrote into the work which could be secured only through what? Organization. Sixthly, he was a man of strong personal apprentip of a remarkably generous nature to have a regard for the interest of others and to see that their circumstances were rendered as favorable as possible was a part of his name. Amen. So I love those characteristics of James White. And when the teacher was speaking about James White, I was very impressed by that point and I say I had to read it. But I said that the James White of the last days are going to die up early. And if they are not if they don't die early, it means that they're not what working. I'm still contemplating upon that. If you are against wife in the congregation, do meditate upon that. May God bless the teacher of we shall be talking about that. I know that the Lord has led us in the past we don't fear for the people for the future. Amen. So welcome again to the class of education educator. This class I look on very few things. This class I'm going to give much time for question and answer because I only have two classes that is remaining. In my next class I'll be looking away for a solution in regation and that is what we had looking when last we about the one aim of the purple systemation I realize that the aim of the purple system is to do what to overthrow what to overthrow protestantism I don't know how to say that is in his way but I know that the first aim of the purple and the system of education is to make sure that protestants are destroyed. Realize that papacy does this through the order of Jesuits. Are we together? When was the order of J established? when by whom somebody of them can apply and we have controversy in 234 told us that what they do is that they what they are together they don't visit schools they don't say they establish schools but they They invented the war or dolls prisons get the poor. But for the young children they do what? They they established schools for the what for the common people and the colleges for the children of the princess and by that the children of Protestants were drawn into the observance of popish what popish right that was southern soldiers that the best way to control protestants is just to control their education. Education examples remaining 14. What made me the declaration of the United Nations is that they never understood the true science of what? Education. Hallelujah. And therefore seventh day adventist that was to them an example. Those things were written that they need to be a what? An example that this last days if are not going to understand the two sides of education their information are not going for because they realize that the message and the two of the two And he also realized that the education is the birthight of what of information on a man and I was very happy when the teacher of church heritage was also saying that what is the catalyst of information the catalyst Who are these people in the class? What is the catalyst of reformation? Well, you will tell them the catalyst of reformation is publishing house. And we saw that the present true publishing house was established in year but you were in class and 1850 go. So the catalyst of information is republic publishing. The path right and what strengthens the information is through science of educate education while the right arm of the gospel becomes the what medical missionary. Amen. So those three things that is that we have to maintain our what publishing ourselves schools is going to restaurants. Hallelujah. You will only establish restaurants after establishing house as an school. Hallelujah. Don't run for a restaurant before even establishing one school. Amen. Say amen. Hallelujah. P the B is for information then the right arm that is missionary then you can go for a restaurant. Amen. So in this class I'm going to give very brief notes very brief. and try to be brief and give time for more questions. Now last time we left at the point where we say that we need schools that are going to repudiate the principles of purpose. Hallelujah. I'll take from that in the next class and we'll see how to establish schools, what is to be taught in the schools and also the selection of teachers to teach in the world in the schools. Are we together? So that I want to preserve for the next lesson and my last lesson the topic of my last lesson will be you must be able to decide for himself. Amen. So if the question that we'll be having that be we'll be touching on the how to establish schools what is to be taught in schools and the selection of teachers you can preserve that question for the next class but today I'm going to give generally the questions of all the studies that I've been having in this class. If you had a question, kindly prepare your question because I'm going to eat time. But as for now, I want to begin giving the characteristics of true and the true education and the characteristics of worldly system education. Then I give a few a very brief then I look at two examples only two examples. I look at Christ today and look at the Greek history very brief. then I'll be able to finish my presentation. I'll be very brief. Now write characteristics of true and false system of education. Then we begin with false system education. The book of James 3:3 is what are beginning to read is there is where we are going to pick our characteristics and see them very fast. Somebody is there to help me read. Brother God pray you can just come and sit here use a microphone to help me read these things very fast. And you will also help me project the quotations because those who are sitting there is like they have gone for a short break and they are coming back. So you can fill that position. James 3 and the 13 the Bible says hallelujah 3:1 and you also take your book and write the following. The Bible says James says James 3:3 The Bible says if you have But if you have bitter envy and strive in your heart not do not glory not lie not against and lie not against the truth. This wisdom the wisdom that comprises of envy and strife descended not from above. It descended not from above. And it is earthly it is earthly sensual sensual and devilish and devilish and we saw that that the first method of the district system of education is to make people complete so right of systemation number one it it comprises of beta envy it comprises of beta envy somebody's looking at the wall thinking that they're being projected I'm not going to project them let me Just read them for you in this laptop and write them. It comprises of beta environ. Number two, it promotes strife in the heart. It promotes strife in the heart. Number three, it does not descend from above. Number two, promote strength in the heart. Promote strength in the heart. promote strive in the heart. The next says it, it does not descend from above. Amen. In other words, it does not descend from the father. In the book of John 8:44, we tell you that anything that does not desend from the father comes from who? Satan. Amen. Anything false is satanic. Amen. So it does not descend from above. It is earthly. It is earthly. It is earthly. That is number four. Number five, it is sensual. It is sensual. Number five, it is satanic stroke. Demonic stroke delish. In other words, put in bracket. It makes people worship us. It is a satanic paganism, demonic, devilish. Those are the same things. I'm going to the characteristics of education the book of James chapter 3. You proceed I'll try read the Bible. Uh 3 verse number 15. The Bible says this wisdom this wisdom descendant from above. It does not descend from above it is sensual and deish those ones we have written that is the characteristics of purple system education and world system education or you can still write system of education but realize that we have another kind of education. Now you can also write characteristics of true education. characteristics of truth education. Philippians 3 16 the Bible says it says from ending and strife is there is confusion and every evil one but the wisdom that is from above the wisdom that is from above that is first the first characteristic of true education it descendeth from above write that it descendeth from above it is godly it is godly and promotes Christianity Write that statement that way. It descended from above. It is godly and promotes Christianity. Number two, it is pure. I think the book of James chapter 3 has been projected. It is pure. It is pure. In other words, no unnecessary knowledge. We realize that in the world of education there are necessary what? Knowledge. Amen. And there are things that are taught that should not be taught to Christians today. Today today no unnecessary there's no no any unnecessary knowledge. Number three, it is peaceable. It is peaceable. Write very fast. Write very fast. Time is running. I want to write very fast. It is peaceable. It is gentle. It is peaceable. It is gentle. It is easily treated. Somebody saw that easily in treated full of m is full of nami. It is full of good fruits. It is easily intreated. It is easily intreated. It is full of mer. Full of good fruits. Full of mer. Full of good fruits. without partiality, without hypocrisy. Realize that the worst of education is hypocrisy. It is a form of godliness. You pretend to be loving God, but unite them in works. Without hypocrisy, the fruit of righteousness is sown in its principle. The fields of righteousness is in every characteristics of truth education. Amen. Amen. Education and we say that that is the monique. I'm giving two aims of system education two only. The rest you will go and study for yourself. My first point from the Sabbath was that it it aim is to overthrow what? Protestantism. Number two, write this number two. So if you're writing your I know you write notes on the so if you want to write them just write a purposes then you write continuation then you just write number two are you think it proves the Bible to be error and a theory it proves the Bible to be error and a theory. There was a quotation by was read that was read by brother Neon I think it was ministry of it should be page 443 maybe I'm going to check the page I give but it says that philosophical speculation and scientific research philosophical speculation and scientific research in which God is not acknowledged are making skeptics of thousands in the schools of today the conclusion that learned men have reached as the result of their scientific investigation are carefully taught and fully explained while the impression is distinctly given that if these learned men are correct the Bible cannot be hallelujah hallelujah so we are told that the theories that are taught in school today evolution if they can be correct then the Bible cannot be correct so one of the aim of the purple education is that it proves the Bible to be error and a theory. So that is why today it makes people not study the Bible because they believe that is an error. It is just a theory what is believed. Amen. Next aim it promotes a self this what we tackled in our last so I'm going to deal with few examples and give questions to this class. It promotes self the root of all evil. It promotes self the root of evil. Education page 225 paragraph 4. Education 225 education page 2.5 says precious the service done and the education gained in carrying out these principles but how widely different is much of the education now given from the child's earliest years is an appeal of emulation and rivalry of emulation and what that is. So we are told that it fosters selfishness the root of all evil page paragraph 4. It is not from the beginning. It was taken just the last part where it says that precious the service done and the education gained in carrying out the princip this principles but how widely different is much of the education now given from the child's earliest years that fosters selfishness the root of all what all evil allow me repeat this quotation that was uh testing church 3 page 384 paragraph 3 I think that is the reputation says the following words 384 paragraph 3 384 paragraph number three says it says it says when the lamb and the takes position of the heart and becomes a ruling passion Mhm. That is not what I want. What I want say is under the general heading of selfishness came every other scene. That is what I'm looking for today because the system of education of today strengthens what? Selfishness. Let me check if it is this one. volume 4 paragraph 3 I'm sorry not speech says that another book was opened wherein were recording the saints of those who profess the truth under the general heading of selfishness came every other sin there were also headings over every column and these opposite each names were recorded in their respective columns the lesser saints so what I wanted you to understand that in this systemation promoting came in other words the system of education the worldly system of education promotes what sin sle can someone overcome sin with that system of education no is very is impossible but the grace of god is sufficient for those we decide to make decision decision. So it is also like this. It is also idol worshiping is also idle worshiing. This takes me to the great green history very fast green very fast. And I'm reading SDP SDP. This is page uh SDP page uh let me get the page page 80. Get this. I was to look at this green history very deeply but time is not going to allow me to give that because I already see I have 40 minutes but I wanted to give a good time to questions and answer this page 181 182 paragraph one says the following I want to be projected to see that system of education is idol woriing you are not woriing god why system ofation However much we come to the church on Sabbath and we go back and we prepare meals on Friday. Hallelujah. I want to see that. I want to see that. 1821 1821 says it says there is a pathetic straight throughout their history. They sympathetic straight throughout their history and their history what Greek history are together. What is the characteristics of Greeks that you know they are speaking for what? Wisdom. Hallelujah. But is there wisdom is if Christ is preached they say that is foolishness foolishness. I mean with you in the book of 1 Corinthians 1:21 23. So the Greeks are only seeking for whistle but they all fruit Christ as for foolishness. Hallelujah. But Christians need to have Christ. Are we together? So there's a pathetic strength throughout their history. They come so close to God. They come so close to God. They come so close to they come so close to the God of whom? Uhhuh. And yet not knowing him. And yet not knowing him. They wandered in such utter darkness. Continuing there is a constant reminder of the faith of those students of today. The Greek history is a constant reminder to the students of whom? They seek to understand natural phenomenal they can explain how much kilaro was formed. Are you they know and they have theories that will explain how the world came to exist exist and they can explain how we have seven continents. Amen. And they know what happened between the seas and the land. They can explain. They want to understand natural what phenomena but do what? Continuing. But do not interpret nature. They do not interpret nature. By the words of his creator. By the words of who? His great. Is great. Hallelujah. In other words, the nature should be interpreted by the words of who? Of creator. And the words of creator is in what? The the Bible. Hallelujah. So people understanding the phenomena without the by the way you cannot stud the Bible they go to you told that heaven is a what is a school nature what listen I read that quotation when I was reading that page 547 says that heaven is a what a school so there's the students of today are desiring to understand phenomena but do not interpret nature by the word of the creator. Now listen to the next statement. Hallelujah. Someone who is tired get this next statement. It says they worship who? Zeus and Pluto Pluto instead of instead of the Christ. So if you are answering questions in you idol worship. Yes. The Bible will tell you that you cannot worship two people. No one can serve what two masters. Amen. So when you are coming to the church but in the other hand you what you need to know that you have one master. Are we together? So it is idol should be continue reading the fact that the children of today the fact that the children of today upon myths and tradition of this are fed upon myth and tradition of this very in darkness gods of Olympus and ignorant of God whose shoot the mountains against whose smile was sanding Uh-huh. And whoever the fields, the Greeks, the Greeksh were they accepted the sacrifice of the slain of the lamb of God. Greeks offered what? But we are asked that what value of their sacrifice if they rejected the lamb of God. The system of education today people sacrifice. Amen. And they give offerings that to do what to sacrifice continually saying the spirit of prophecy the spirit of prophecy was cherished was cherished but when God's prophet made the But while God's prophet mingled with the three people, the Greek prophet secluded from the peopleh. Amen. So I don't want you to know that today I'm praying to worship God. Amen. That will be my call. This week is a week of making and we are told that when a call is made and you make a step forward and God is going to give you angels to go to. Amen. So we have people in the in the Bible. We have people in the Bible of whom the word of God was studied. The last we saw in the education of Moses. I want just to reiterate this that Moses studied in who school? In the schools of Egypt. Are we together? And Moses studied very great topics. We saw that Moses was a philosopher. He was a poet. He was a mathematician. And we were told that Moses used to call what? And used to score airplanes not airplanes but when God called Moses he had to under system to get education. Hallelujah. He has to go to God's universe. Hallelujah. Amen. And we are also told not only that I want to read for last one quotation that will summarize the education and last we also saw when they were answering a question a brother asked we realized that there were also schools of prophets in which Daniel's friends to obtain their what education and the education was very high more than the education that was provided in the universities and colleges of what United you reading it again very fast then we come to something I'm just next to coming to the end of my I want to give you time to answer questions the place of Bible 8 page 80 this is a book written by also Trevor a pioneer of 7th Adventist. Now this is page 80 paragraph one project that you see this the schools of the prophets there were schools of the prophets at the same time there also schools of the palants now look at the education that was in the schools of the prophets is it there from the specification distinct remain in the scripture from the specification decision made in the scripture from the product that must be passed. It is certain that all we have of life must comprehend the requirements of the king's respect of the king respecting the youth who are to beh and this no small tribute is no small tribute to the educational ideas of king indeed his views of education in this verse as soon in this verse I'm talking Daniel chapter one chapter one from verse four in this verse of the Bible in this verse of the Bible for all practical purposes for in advance for in advance of the educational system that prevents people the kind of the people that require the education was advanced more than the education that people acquire today today today. Hallelujah. Daniel was very wise. Amen. He was very wise and he qualified to be chosen to serve at the king's what palace. Are we together? Now continue reading even in the living colleges. That prevents even the living and universities. The living is universities where United States not even amened what United States. Amen. That is the wherein that proceed in the paragraph that is paragraph three. It says, it says Daniel, where did Daniel and his three companions and his three companions obtain the education which enable them successfully which enable them successfully to pass the examination to pass the examination require that exist of the leading the leading of United where can that education be acquired? them and education which made them skillful and knowledge and understanding science and understanding what science science and which gave them ability and which they gave them ability in all the things withoutation it can be answered but but I like that place I like that place I want you to see But you see people today are talking of the education. You see these things or these things and maybe education of the world. You see this this cameras, this laptop and and we said last time that not every knowledge is from the what? We realize that Satan with and when God has given a knowledge that will help in the taking the gospel of the message people has to accept that knowledge. Are you so I will read your quotation that says that whosoever staples this conviction because it is what inclinations will soon fail to determine between truth and you are my light no without education can be answered it can be answered in the school of the prophets. In the schools of the what? The prophets. He established school in there was at that time there was at that time a school a school of schools of the prophets in Jerusalem in Jerusalem. Hallelujah. So there were schools of the prophets in Jerusalem. Amen. And you remember during the time when the sons of the prophets were going to cut what? Trees. Where were they? In the school of the prophets. Amen. And they were going to build what classics. Amen. They were going to build classes. Where the hallelujah. So green fields, green history will change you. There is something. Have you ever known why there's a a gap between and have you ever known why a gap that is between Greek history that Greek history answers that then I'm looking just example of Christ I'm giving you time for questions 19 get this Get this why there is an ass time between Malachi and the book of Matthew SDP the page is 190 paragraph this will tell you about the issue that has happened what God had given to his people and what is happening in this last days it says 192 this one is wasting now time let me use this for it has that the inoc the time between the prophecy of Malachi between the prophecy of Malachi and John the Baptist and John the Baptist when is John the history of John the Baptist beginning in the book of Mark Matthew Are you yes continue reading we are now ready we are now ready to appreciate the reason to appreciate The reason Israel why Israel so long was so long without the sound without the sound of the prophet's voice of the prophet's voice God God is a communication system of what education hallelujah how many are seeing the history of the Greece how it appeared in God's word look at this God gave Israel a sense of what education separate and distinct from the system of all other nations. Nations. Hallelujah. So could Israel go to other system of other nations? No. of today. Amen. And we will be putting that verse that is first that we are the people what nations. Uhhuh. Chosen. Chosen what? Is a chosen what? So if the chosen generation seventh day adventist today, God is a separate and distinct the system of all other nation. A system continue a system which ifever would forever make it impossible make it impossible for the people for the people to go into. So they were following it says it says but Israel but Israel gave up a god-given system for teaching for the teaching nation of the hidden what nations. Next it says look at that very painful that however much God gave them a system that was different from all other nations but they gave up to the teachings of other what nations are together they went to another system of what education they copied other nations and allow me tell you how many have ever read the book of numbers chapter 25 chapter 25 what is happening in numbers chapter 25 numbers numbers chapter 25 it was even presented Yeah. Ecumenical movement. Ecumenical what? Movement. Do you know the tribe in Israel that led that? The tribe in that was the tribe of Robert. What to birth? What is the birth of education? The science of what? Education. So we are going to join movement after doing what? Selling our birthight. You go to cross and shadow page 288. That one we read paragraph 3. Go to paragraph 4. Read the next you realize that the tribe of the women were the people who went and choose and stay next to Moabites. Are you together? And by that they selling their what? Their so people are going to sell your true science of others. Okay. If we go to the system of other other gods and other gods today, tell me a school today where one god is taught the schools of the world. We are going to go to captivity and number 25 is going to repeat itself itself. It continuc religion. Hallelujah. No one can go to that education and come up with a pure mind. You know that are also using that verse. I always read you that it is only that time is limited. The first principles of the child. If you turn up a child from 1 to 12 years you will forever. That is what are saying that is written in fundamental of education where books reading go and get that book to read. You see today elders are coming some elders some are coming and say train up a child. So if you are doing with them they will not do what this is worshiping of God but when they went to they came up with religion. But let me ask you those who obtained their education in the schools of the prophets like Daniel were they simulated with that system of education? No. Were they impressed by that religion? No. When you teach Daniel chapter 3, they refused to bow down what to the idol. Are you so going to under go the beast and let the change and the grace of God be sufficient to the unto them. Hallelujah. Somebody is sleeping in this class. Just wake up a man. The grace of God is sufficient to those who sleeping. Hallelujah. So it continues by saying I won't finish. It continues by saying uh Jews return from Babylon. Jews return from Babylon. Babylonian ideas of education and religion. This prepared them with readiness. The teaching of the the teachings of the Greeks. A question. What have we read that the teaching of the Greek is leading to? I do not. I I when somebody is trying to understand phenomena of the earth without the Bible in that age. So they were able to accept the teachings of the Greek. The Greeks continually from Malachi of John the Baptist. family go and read others for yourself. Amen. Amen. By the way, what made you follow the system? But you know, God has arrived to do what worship him. So there were those who remained and remain steadfast to the system. I'm looking up Christ as an example. Then I'm giving time for prayers. Christ as an example. The book of that is first Peter 2 verse 21. The Bible says the following words 2 verse 21 says the Bible reads the reads uh 2 2 Uh-huh. Because Uh-huh. Because Christ also suffered for us. Because Christ also suffered for us. Living as an example. Living as an example. That you should follow. That you should follow what? Yes. That Christ left an example that you should follow what? First John 2 verse 6. It says, It says John 2 verse 6. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. He that he abideth in him. He that he abideth in himself to walk even walk as he walk. Hallelujah. How many love that verse? How many love that verse? And when you can preach that verse, you will talk of Christ humility. Hallelujah. You talk of Christ kindness. Amen. Will you mention that in that verse? Hallelujah. Amen. Will you mention those? But people always mention the Christ. Do we always mention the Christ? But what the Bible says is that we read again. It says it says he that abided him abided in him. God himself to walk him even as he walked. All you want to say so Christ, you talk of Christ, you talk of Christ, you talk of Christy, you talk of Christ verse 28, the Bible say the mans And when they saw him, And when they saw him, they were amazed. They were amazed. And his mother said unto him, And his mother said unto him, Son, why this the Bible? It says, son, why hast thou dealt with us? Behold, thy father and household this. Uhhuh. I'm checking the verse where it says that and the child grew 40. The Bible says the child and the child grew what strong in spirit and what strong in spirit that is Jesus Christ filled with wisdom. Filled with what? Wisdom. Filled with what? Wisdom. Wisdom. And the grace of God was upon you. And the grace of God was upon him. Christ was also filled with what? Wisdom. He now Christ was is our example. And if you're buying in Christ, we need to follow the step of Christ. Look at this. I'm reading this pages page 9 page 7 69 paragraph 3 then I paragraph one then I pray listen to the following words in the in the name of Christ for religious instruction for that that did not provide for religious instruction of the young regard was regarded under of God. Next statement had become for tradition in a great degree supplanted supplanted what? The script. That is the name of Christ. That tradition supplanted the what? The script. Hallelujah. So the only thing that could be lifted is tradition more than script scriptures. Uhhuh. [Music] by these teachers. But the next paragon receive instruction in the synagogue in the synagogue schools in the synagogue schools. His mother was his first human was his first human teacher from the scorn of the mother the mother of Jesus used the syllabus of the education of the prop the schools of the prop the same thing that was taught to Daniel was taught to whom Christ amen that is why Christ was very very wise his wisdom exceeded the wisdom of the universities of United States. Amen. My time is running fast. I want to stop. Amen. So this subject is some sometimes interesting that I begin reading something. I realize that time man. Amen. But God may God be the help follow Christ before those who successfully mission movement in Jesus name. Amen. Allow me then I need time for questions. I'm praying. Thank you for the system education that you given to the Israelites. We also were able to study and their wisdom exed all other wisdom that could be in the world. That is the wisdom we require today as people to make sure that we have a character paid for it. Help us dear Lord in heaven to make a step of faith to do the call that you're doing over us to education. Dear all heaven as you shall be looking other things are to be established. God we pray that you may help us have a people who are going to stand for this for I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.",
        "timestamped_transcript": "[2.0s] I'm also a lover of\n[4.3s] history and when church was being\n[7.0s] presented I was in Christ by something\n[10.2s] that I want to read\n[12.8s] uh I said that I have to read this month\n[14.9s] before this congregation before I go\n[16.6s] into the\n[17.9s] subject moment I'm reading in\n[22.5s] three three\n[24.7s] Bible page 174 when the teacher\n[28.8s] of church. He was talking about somebody\n[32.1s] called James White. I said that I had to\n[35.0s] read this thing before this congregation\n[36.8s] because I loved the characteristics of\n[39.4s] James White and the God is calling for\n[41.9s] James White in the last days to be able\n[44.4s] to carry on the work\n[47.3s] uh the work that the Lord has left us.\n[50.1s] That is the work of preaching the news\n[53.0s] message. There is three bio three\n[55.8s] biography 4 paragraph 36 I'm commenting\n[60.2s] about what the teacher said about James\n[61.9s] White and I'm going to read the funeral\n[65.8s] program of James White when he died in\n[68.3s] 188\n[70.4s] what James White\n[73.4s] died 18 which\n[77.0s] month which date fixed you need to know\n[81.6s] that now this is Smith who was the\n[84.2s] secretary of the general conference when\n[86.6s] James went was working. Uh 374 paragraph\n[90.6s] 6 says Smith enumerated in some detail\n[93.8s] giving illustrations predominating\n[96.3s] traits and characteristics of a man with\n[99.1s] whom he had worked intimately for so\n[102.0s] many years. We first noticed that in the\n[105.3s] times of confusion and excitement he was\n[108.2s] what? Always calm and cool. Are we\n[111.8s] together? That is the first\n[113.2s] characteristics of who? James White. In\n[115.7s] times of confusion, James White was\n[118.2s] always calm and what? And cool. We are\n[121.4s] told. Secondly, he was a man never given\n[123.9s] to what fanatism. Number three, he was\n[128.2s] thirdly, he was endured with remarkable\n[131.8s] acuteness of perception to determine the\n[135.8s] most delicious moves to be made.\n[138.5s] Hallelujah. Those are characteristics of\n[140.9s] whom James went. Fourthly, he was a man\n[144.5s] who would never to discuss\n[146.7s] discouragement. And I love that the word\n[149.9s] fail was not in his what? Vocabul.\n[153.8s] Hallelujah. God is calling for him today\n[157.0s] who can never what? Discouragement.\n[160.0s] Amen. And I see him in the meeting.\n[163.0s] There are people here the word fail\n[165.2s] cannot be what vocabulary. Fifthly, he\n[169.1s] was a man who looked forward to the\n[171.3s] future ones of his work and make\n[173.2s] provision for them. He foraw that\n[175.5s] certain elements stability of stability\n[178.3s] must be wrote into the work which could\n[180.8s] be secured only through what?\n[183.7s] Organization. Sixthly, he was a man of\n[186.9s] strong personal apprentip of a\n[189.0s] remarkably generous nature to have a\n[191.8s] regard for the interest of others and to\n[195.0s] see that their circumstances were\n[197.0s] rendered as favorable as possible was a\n[200.4s] part of his name. Amen. So I love those\n[203.8s] characteristics of James White. And when\n[206.1s] the teacher was speaking about James\n[207.6s] White, I was very impressed by that\n[210.1s] point and I say I had to read it. But I\n[212.9s] said that the James White of the last\n[215.6s] days are going to die up early. And if\n[219.8s] they are not if they don't die early, it\n[221.8s] means that they're not what working. I'm\n[225.0s] still contemplating upon that. If you\n[227.4s] are against wife in the congregation, do\n[229.7s] meditate upon that. May God bless the\n[232.0s] teacher\n[232.9s] of we shall be talking about that. I\n[236.1s] know that the Lord has led us in the\n[238.6s] past we don't fear for the people for\n[241.0s] the future. Amen. So welcome again to\n[243.4s] the class of\n[246.4s] education educator. This class I look on\n[249.8s] very few things. This class I'm going to\n[252.4s] give much time for question and answer\n[255.8s] because I only have two classes that is\n[257.8s] remaining. In my next class I'll be\n[260.5s] looking away for a solution in regation\n[264.3s] and that is what we had looking when\n[266.9s] last we about the one aim of the purple\n[271.5s] systemation I realize that the aim of\n[273.9s] the purple system is to do what to\n[276.8s] overthrow\n[278.0s] what to overthrow protestantism I don't\n[281.8s] know how to say that is in his way but I\n[284.5s] know that the first aim of the purple\n[287.7s] and the system of education is to make\n[290.2s] sure that protestants are destroyed.\n[293.6s] Realize that papacy does this through\n[296.6s] the order of Jesuits. Are we together?\n[300.3s] When was the order of J established?\n[307.9s] when by\n[311.6s] whom\n[315.3s] somebody of them can apply and we have\n[318.1s] controversy in 234 told us that what\n[321.2s] they do is that they what\n[326.8s] they are together they don't visit\n[330.4s] schools they don't say they establish\n[332.7s] schools but they They invented the war\n[335.5s] or dolls prisons get the poor. But for\n[339.8s] the young children they do what? They\n[342.9s] they established schools for the what\n[345.0s] for the common people and the colleges\n[348.1s] for the children of the princess and by\n[351.0s] that the children of Protestants were\n[354.1s] drawn into the observance of popish what\n[357.8s] popish\n[358.8s] right that was southern soldiers that\n[363.1s] the best way to control protestants is\n[366.5s] just to control their\n[374.7s] education.\n[376.3s] Education examples remaining 14. What\n[379.8s] made me the declaration of the United\n[381.4s] Nations is that they never understood\n[384.0s] the true science of what? Education.\n[386.8s] Hallelujah. And therefore seventh day\n[389.0s] adventist that was to them an example.\n[392.3s] Those things were written that they need\n[394.2s] to be a what? An example that this last\n[396.7s] days if are not going to understand the\n[400.5s] two sides of education their information\n[403.1s] are not going\n[405.1s] for because they realize that the\n[407.8s] message and the two\n[421.1s] of\n[422.8s] the two\n[433.5s] And he also realized that the education\n[436.2s] is the birthight of\n[439.2s] what of information on a man and I was\n[442.5s] very happy when the teacher of church\n[445.2s] heritage was also saying that what is\n[446.9s] the catalyst of\n[448.4s] information the catalyst\n[454.3s] Who are these people in the class? What\n[456.6s] is the catalyst of reformation? Well,\n[458.8s] you will tell them the catalyst of\n[460.8s] reformation is publishing house. And we\n[463.5s] saw that the present true publishing\n[465.6s] house was established in\n[467.5s] year but you were in class\n[475.8s] and\n[477.3s] 1850\n[480.9s] go. So the catalyst of information is\n[483.7s] republic publishing. The path right and\n[487.0s] what strengthens the information is\n[489.7s] through science of educate education\n[492.1s] while the right arm of the gospel\n[493.8s] becomes the what medical missionary.\n[496.4s] Amen. So those three things that is that\n[499.8s] we have to maintain our what publishing\n[502.2s] ourselves\n[504.4s] schools is going to restaurants.\n[508.8s] Hallelujah. You will only establish\n[511.2s] restaurants after establishing house as\n[514.1s] an school. Hallelujah. Don't run for a\n[517.0s] restaurant before even establishing one\n[519.4s] school. Amen. Say amen.\n[523.8s] Hallelujah. P the\n[526.2s] B is for information then the right arm\n[529.4s] that is missionary then you can go for a\n[531.7s] restaurant. Amen. So in this class I'm\n[533.8s] going to give very brief notes very\n[536.7s] brief. and try to be brief and give time\n[540.4s] for more questions. Now last time we\n[542.4s] left at the point where we say that we\n[544.7s] need schools that are going to repudiate\n[547.6s] the principles of purpose. Hallelujah.\n[552.0s] I'll take from that in the next class\n[555.1s] and we'll see how to establish\n[558.5s] schools, what is to be taught in the\n[561.3s] schools and also the selection of\n[564.8s] teachers to teach in the world in the\n[568.0s] schools. Are we together? So that I want\n[570.1s] to preserve for the next lesson and my\n[572.5s] last lesson the topic of my last lesson\n[575.0s] will be you must be able to decide for\n[579.4s] himself. Amen. So if the question that\n[583.2s] we'll be having that be we'll be\n[585.8s] touching on the how to establish schools\n[589.4s] what is to be taught in schools and the\n[591.5s] selection of teachers you can preserve\n[593.8s] that question for the next class but\n[595.9s] today I'm going to give generally the\n[598.7s] questions of all the studies that I've\n[600.9s] been having in this class. If you had a\n[603.1s] question, kindly prepare your question\n[605.1s] because I'm going to eat time. But as\n[607.0s] for now, I want to begin giving the\n[608.9s] characteristics of true and the true\n[612.1s] education and the characteristics of\n[614.3s] worldly system education. Then I give a\n[616.7s] few\n[620.5s] a very brief then I look at two examples\n[624.7s] only two examples. I look at Christ\n[627.4s] today and look at the Greek history very\n[630.6s] brief. then I'll be able to finish my\n[632.5s] presentation. I'll be very brief. Now\n[634.1s] write characteristics of true and false\n[636.7s] system of education. Then we begin with\n[638.3s] false system education. The book of\n[640.1s] James 3:3 is what are beginning to read\n[643.4s] is there is where we are going to pick\n[645.2s] our characteristics and see them very\n[647.9s] fast. Somebody is there to help me read.\n[650.8s] Brother God pray you can just come and\n[652.5s] sit here use a microphone to help me\n[654.7s] read these things very fast. And you\n[657.0s] will also help me project the quotations\n[659.0s] because those who are sitting there is\n[661.0s] like they have gone for a short break\n[663.2s] and they are coming back. So you can\n[665.0s] fill that position. James 3 and the 13\n[669.3s] the Bible\n[670.8s] says\n[673.2s] hallelujah 3:1 and you also take your\n[677.0s] book and write the following. The Bible\n[678.6s] says\n[680.0s] James says James 3:3 The Bible says if\n[684.5s] you have But if you have bitter envy\n[688.5s] and strive in your heart not do not\n[693.2s] glory not lie not against and lie not\n[696.7s] against the truth. This wisdom the\n[699.2s] wisdom that comprises of envy and strife\n[703.4s] descended not from above. It descended\n[705.9s] not from above. And it is earthly it is\n[709.0s] earthly sensual sensual and devilish and\n[712.1s] devilish and we saw that that the first\n[714.2s] method of the district system of\n[715.8s] education is to make\n[718.0s] people complete so\n[721.4s] right of systemation number one it it\n[725.6s] comprises of beta envy it comprises of\n[729.1s] beta envy somebody's looking at the wall\n[732.6s] thinking that they're being projected\n[734.4s] I'm not going to project them let me\n[736.3s] Just read them for you in this laptop\n[737.8s] and write them. It comprises of beta\n[740.4s] environ. Number two, it promotes strife\n[743.9s] in the heart. It promotes strife in the\n[748.0s] heart. Number three, it does not descend\n[750.7s] from\n[754.7s] above. Number two, promote strength in\n[757.8s] the heart. Promote strength in the\n[760.7s] heart.\n[767.1s] promote strive in the\n[776.4s] heart. The next says it, it does not\n[780.4s] descend from\n[782.6s] above. Amen.\n[786.5s] In other words, it does not descend from\n[788.0s] the father. In the book of John 8:44, we\n[792.0s] tell you that anything that does not\n[794.4s] desend from the father comes from who?\n[796.9s] Satan. Amen. Anything false is satanic.\n[801.1s] Amen. So it does not descend from above.\n[804.2s] It is earthly. It is\n[808.3s] earthly. It is earthly. That is number\n[811.7s] four. Number five, it is sensual.\n[815.8s] It is\n[818.4s] sensual. Number\n[820.8s] five, it\n[822.7s] is\n[825.6s] satanic stroke.\n[828.6s] Demonic stroke\n[832.3s] delish. In other words, put in\n[836.0s] bracket. It makes people\n[840.4s] worship us.\n[844.0s] It is a\n[845.2s] satanic paganism, demonic, devilish.\n[847.8s] Those are the same\n[849.2s] things. I'm going to the characteristics\n[851.4s] of education the book of James chapter\n[853.4s] 3. You\n[854.8s] proceed I'll\n[864.3s] try read the Bible. Uh\n[867.7s] 3 verse number 15. The Bible says this\n[871.2s] wisdom this wisdom descendant from\n[873.4s] above. It does not descend from above\n[876.8s] it is sensual and deish those ones we\n[881.1s] have written that is the characteristics\n[882.8s] of purple system education and world\n[884.5s] system education or you can still write\n[887.0s] system of education but realize that we\n[889.5s] have another kind of education. Now you\n[892.4s] can also write characteristics of true\n[895.4s] education. characteristics of truth\n[898.3s] education.\n[901.8s] Philippians 3 16 the Bible says it says\n[906.5s] from ending and strife is there is\n[910.3s] confusion and every evil one but the\n[914.6s] wisdom that is from above the wisdom\n[917.1s] that is from above that is first the\n[919.7s] first characteristic of true education\n[921.8s] it descendeth from above write that it\n[925.6s] descendeth from above it is godly it is\n[929.0s] godly and promotes Christianity Write\n[931.8s] that statement that way. It descended\n[934.2s] from above. It is godly and promotes\n[941.2s] Christianity. Number two, it is\n[945.0s] pure. I think the book of James chapter\n[948.2s] 3 has been projected. It is pure. It is\n[951.8s] pure. In other words, no unnecessary\n[954.6s] knowledge. We realize that in the world\n[956.6s] of education there are necessary what?\n[959.3s] Knowledge. Amen. And there are things\n[961.7s] that are taught that should not be\n[963.0s] taught to Christians today. Today today\n[966.2s] no unnecessary there's no no any\n[968.9s] unnecessary knowledge. Number three, it\n[971.0s] is peaceable. It is\n[973.3s] peaceable. Write very fast. Write very\n[975.8s] fast. Time is running. I want to write\n[978.4s] very fast. It is\n[980.4s] peaceable. It is\n[983.6s] gentle. It is peaceable. It is\n[986.3s] gentle. It is easily treated.\n[991.6s] Somebody saw that easily in\n[995.6s] treated full of\n[998.4s] m is full of\n[1001.1s] nami. It is full of good fruits.\n[1017.2s] It is easily\n[1019.4s] intreated. It is\n[1021.5s] easily\n[1024.8s] intreated. It is full of\n[1029.5s] mer. Full of good\n[1034.3s] fruits. Full of mer. Full of good\n[1037.3s] fruits. without\n[1044.8s] partiality, without hypocrisy. Realize\n[1047.6s] that the worst of education is\n[1050.3s] hypocrisy. It is a form of godliness.\n[1053.7s] You pretend to be loving God, but unite\n[1056.3s] them in\n[1058.1s] works. Without hypocrisy, the fruit of\n[1062.0s] righteousness is sown in its principle.\n[1066.3s] The fields of righteousness is in\n[1072.9s] every characteristics of truth\n[1076.1s] education. Amen. Amen.\n[1080.2s] Education and we say that that is the\n[1082.8s] monique. I'm giving two aims of system\n[1085.9s] education two only. The rest you will go\n[1088.8s] and study for yourself. My first point\n[1091.1s] from the Sabbath was that\n[1094.0s] it it aim is to overthrow what?\n[1096.8s] Protestantism. Number two, write this\n[1099.5s] number two. So if you're writing your I\n[1103.0s] know you write notes on the so if you\n[1105.7s] want to write them just write a\n[1108.4s] purposes then you write continuation\n[1111.5s] then you just write number two are\n[1114.5s] you\n[1119.3s] think it proves the Bible to be error\n[1122.9s] and a\n[1123.7s] theory it proves the Bible to be\n[1126.8s] error and a theory. There was a\n[1129.0s] quotation by was read that was read by\n[1131.4s] brother Neon I think it was ministry of\n[1135.0s] it should be page 443 maybe I'm going to\n[1138.0s] check the page I give but it says that\n[1140.1s] philosophical speculation and scientific\n[1142.7s] research philosophical speculation and\n[1145.4s] scientific research in which God is not\n[1149.7s] acknowledged are making skeptics of\n[1152.9s] thousands in the schools of today the\n[1156.0s] conclusion that learned men have reached\n[1157.9s] as the result of their scientific\n[1159.7s] investigation are carefully taught and\n[1161.9s] fully explained while the impression is\n[1164.7s] distinctly given that if these learned\n[1167.6s] men are correct the Bible cannot be\n[1172.1s] hallelujah hallelujah so we are told\n[1175.0s] that the theories that are taught in\n[1176.6s] school today evolution if they can be\n[1179.0s] correct then the Bible cannot be correct\n[1182.6s] so one of the aim of the purple\n[1184.9s] education is that it proves the Bible to\n[1188.2s] be error and a theory. So that is why\n[1191.7s] today it makes people not study the\n[1193.8s] Bible because they believe that is an\n[1196.2s] error. It is just a theory what is\n[1199.6s] believed.\n[1201.2s] Amen. Next aim it promotes a\n[1205.1s] self this what we tackled in our last so\n[1208.9s] I'm going to deal with few examples and\n[1211.8s] give questions to this class.\n[1214.6s] It promotes self the root of all\n[1218.4s] evil. It promotes self the root of evil.\n[1221.0s] Education page 225 paragraph 4.\n[1224.7s] Education\n[1234.6s] 225 education page 2.5 says precious the\n[1240.3s] service done and the education gained in\n[1242.9s] carrying out these principles but how\n[1245.2s] widely different is much of the\n[1247.0s] education now given from the child's\n[1249.5s] earliest years is an appeal of emulation\n[1253.4s] and rivalry\n[1255.1s] of emulation and what that\n[1260.5s] is. So we are told\n[1263.4s] that it fosters\n[1266.4s] selfishness the root of all evil\n[1271.6s] page\n[1275.9s] paragraph 4. It is not from the\n[1278.2s] beginning. It was taken just the last\n[1281.1s] part where it says that precious the\n[1283.3s] service done and the education gained in\n[1285.6s] carrying out the princip this principles\n[1287.6s] but how widely different is much of the\n[1289.4s] education now given from the child's\n[1291.4s] earliest\n[1298.7s] years that fosters selfishness the root\n[1303.2s] of all what all evil allow me repeat\n[1306.7s] this quotation that was uh testing\n[1310.6s] church 3 page 384 paragraph 3 I think\n[1315.1s] that is the reputation says the\n[1316.8s] following words\n[1320.8s] 384 paragraph 3 384\n[1329.1s] paragraph number three says it says it\n[1332.0s] says when the lamb and the takes\n[1334.2s] position of the heart and becomes a\n[1337.0s] ruling passion Mhm.\n[1346.6s] That is not what I want. What I want say\n[1349.0s] is under the general heading of\n[1351.1s] selfishness came every other scene. That\n[1353.2s] is what I'm looking for today because\n[1355.8s] the system of education of today\n[1358.0s] strengthens what?\n[1360.4s] Selfishness. Let me check if it is this\n[1362.6s] one.\n[1371.0s] volume 4 paragraph 3 I'm sorry not\n[1375.0s] speech says that another book was opened\n[1378.3s] wherein were recording the saints of\n[1380.1s] those who profess the truth under the\n[1382.2s] general heading of selfishness came\n[1384.3s] every other sin there were also headings\n[1387.0s] over every column and these opposite\n[1390.3s] each names were recorded in their\n[1392.1s] respective columns the lesser saints so\n[1394.6s] what I wanted you to understand that in\n[1397.1s] this systemation\n[1401.6s] promoting\n[1403.6s] came in other words the system of\n[1406.6s] education the worldly system of\n[1409.1s] education promotes what sin\n[1413.7s] sle can someone overcome sin with that\n[1417.4s] system of education no is very is\n[1421.0s] impossible but the grace of god is\n[1423.0s] sufficient for those we decide to make\n[1425.5s] decision decision. So it is also like\n[1428.6s] this. It is also idol worshiping is also\n[1431.3s] idle worshiing. This takes me to the\n[1433.8s] great green history very fast green very\n[1437.0s] fast. And I'm reading\n[1439.7s] SDP SDP. This is page\n[1444.8s] uh SDP page\n[1449.6s] uh let me get the\n[1452.0s] page\n[1454.2s] page\n[1467.0s] 80. Get this. I was to look at this\n[1470.7s] green\n[1471.7s] history very deeply but time is not\n[1474.1s] going to allow me to give that because I\n[1476.4s] already see I have 40 minutes but I\n[1478.5s] wanted to give a good time to questions\n[1480.8s] and answer this page 181 182 paragraph\n[1486.2s] one says the following I want to be\n[1488.5s] projected to see that system of\n[1490.6s] education is idol\n[1494.0s] woriing you are not woriing god why\n[1497.8s] system ofation However much we come to\n[1499.4s] the church on\n[1500.6s] Sabbath and we go back and we prepare\n[1504.2s] meals on\n[1507.7s] Friday. Hallelujah. I want to see that.\n[1511.4s] I want to see that.\n[1515.5s] 1821 1821 says it says there is a\n[1520.0s] pathetic straight throughout their\n[1521.9s] history. They sympathetic straight\n[1524.3s] throughout their history and their\n[1526.5s] history what Greek history are together.\n[1530.3s] What is the characteristics of Greeks\n[1532.2s] that you\n[1533.3s] know they are speaking for what? Wisdom.\n[1537.2s] Hallelujah. But is there wisdom is if\n[1540.2s] Christ is preached they say that is\n[1542.4s] foolishness foolishness. I mean with you\n[1544.6s] in the book of 1 Corinthians 1:21 23. So\n[1547.9s] the Greeks are only seeking for whistle\n[1550.7s] but they all fruit Christ as for\n[1553.8s] foolishness. Hallelujah. But Christians\n[1556.4s] need to have Christ. Are we together? So\n[1559.4s] there's a pathetic strength throughout\n[1561.3s] their history. They come so close to\n[1564.6s] God. They come so close to God. They\n[1568.0s] come so close to they come so close to\n[1571.0s] the God of whom?\n[1573.0s] Uhhuh. And yet not knowing him. And yet\n[1576.0s] not knowing him.\n[1579.9s] They wandered in such utter darkness.\n[1583.8s] Continuing there is a constant reminder\n[1586.9s] of the faith of those students of today.\n[1590.3s] The Greek history is a constant reminder\n[1594.4s] to the students of whom?\n[1599.3s] They seek to understand\n[1603.7s] natural phenomenal they can explain how\n[1606.4s] much kilaro was formed. Are you they\n[1610.1s] know and they have theories that will\n[1612.4s] explain how the world came to exist\n[1614.9s] exist and they can explain how we have\n[1617.2s] seven continents. Amen. And they know\n[1620.6s] what happened between the seas and the\n[1622.7s] land. They can explain. They want to\n[1625.1s] understand natural what phenomena but do\n[1629.6s] what? Continuing. But do not interpret\n[1633.0s] nature. They do not interpret nature. By\n[1636.6s] the words of his creator. By the words\n[1638.8s] of who? His great. Is great. Hallelujah.\n[1641.5s] In other words, the nature should be\n[1644.0s] interpreted by the words of who? Of\n[1646.2s] creator. And the words of creator is in\n[1648.7s] what? The the Bible. Hallelujah. So\n[1651.9s] people understanding the phenomena\n[1653.6s] without the by the way you cannot\n[1659.2s] stud the Bible they go\n[1662.3s] to you told that heaven is a what is a\n[1666.1s] school nature what listen I read that\n[1669.4s] quotation when I was reading that page\n[1672.8s] 547 says that heaven is a what a school\n[1676.1s] so there's the students of today are\n[1678.3s] desiring to understand phenomena but do\n[1680.3s] not interpret nature by the word of the\n[1683.4s] creator. Now listen to the next\n[1684.7s] statement. Hallelujah. Someone who is\n[1687.0s] tired get this next statement. It says\n[1689.6s] they\n[1693.0s] worship who? Zeus and\n[1697.4s] Pluto Pluto\n[1700.6s] instead of instead of the Christ. So if\n[1703.6s] you are answering questions in you idol\n[1706.5s] worship.\n[1717.5s] Yes. The Bible will tell you that you\n[1720.3s] cannot worship two people. No one can\n[1723.0s] serve what two masters. Amen. So when\n[1725.6s] you are coming to the church but in the\n[1727.6s] other hand you what you need to know\n[1730.1s] that you have one\n[1732.4s] master. Are we together? So it is idol\n[1736.4s] should be continue reading the fact that\n[1738.5s] the children of today the fact that the\n[1740.8s] children of today upon myths and\n[1743.6s] tradition of this are fed upon myth and\n[1747.4s] tradition of this very\n[1751.3s] in darkness\n[1753.7s] gods of Olympus and ignorant of God\n[1758.2s] whose shoot the mountains against\n[1761.8s] whose smile was sanding Uh-huh. And\n[1765.5s] whoever the fields,\n[1768.2s] the Greeks, the Greeksh\n[1773.9s] were they accepted the sacrifice of the\n[1776.6s] slain of the lamb of God. Greeks offered\n[1778.9s] what?\n[1780.6s] But we are asked that what value of\n[1785.0s] their sacrifice if they rejected the\n[1787.1s] lamb of God. The system of education\n[1790.1s] today people sacrifice. Amen. And they\n[1794.1s] give\n[1805.2s] offerings that to do what\n[1811.4s] to sacrifice\n[1813.7s] continually saying the spirit of\n[1815.9s] prophecy the spirit of prophecy was\n[1818.0s] cherished was cherished but when God's\n[1820.8s] prophet made the But while God's prophet\n[1823.8s] mingled with the three people,\n[1827.0s] the Greek prophet\n[1833.9s] secluded from the peopleh.\n[1843.4s] Amen. So I don't\n[1846.8s] want you to know\n[1852.1s] that today I'm\n[1854.8s] praying to worship God. Amen. That will\n[1858.6s] be my call. This week is a week of\n[1860.8s] making and we are told that when a call\n[1863.3s] is made and you make a step forward and\n[1864.7s] God is going to give you angels to go\n[1866.7s] to. Amen. So we have people in the in\n[1869.3s] the Bible. We have people in the Bible\n[1871.8s] of whom the word of God was studied. The\n[1876.1s] last we saw in the education of Moses. I\n[1879.8s] want just to reiterate this that Moses\n[1882.7s] studied in who school? In the schools of\n[1886.1s] Egypt. Are we together? And Moses\n[1889.0s] studied very great topics. We saw that\n[1891.2s] Moses was a philosopher. He was a poet.\n[1893.8s] He was a mathematician. And we were told\n[1895.9s] that Moses used to call what?\n[1899.6s] And used to score airplanes not\n[1903.8s] airplanes but when God called Moses he\n[1906.4s] had to under system to get education.\n[1909.2s] Hallelujah. He has to go to God's\n[1913.3s] universe. Hallelujah. Amen. And we are\n[1916.9s] also told not only that I want to read\n[1919.7s] for last one quotation that will\n[1922.0s] summarize the education and last we also\n[1924.9s] saw when they were answering a question\n[1926.8s] a brother asked we realized that there\n[1928.6s] were also schools of prophets in which\n[1931.1s] Daniel's friends to obtain their what\n[1933.8s] education and the education was very\n[1936.1s] high more than the education that was\n[1939.5s] provided in the universities and\n[1941.8s] colleges of what\n[1945.1s] United\n[1948.4s] you reading it\n[1954.0s] again very fast then we come to\n[1956.9s] something I'm just next to coming to the\n[1959.4s] end of my I want to give you time to\n[1961.6s] answer questions the place of Bible\n[1965.7s] 8 page\n[1973.0s] 80 this is a book written by also Trevor\n[1977.8s] a pioneer of 7th Adventist. Now this is\n[1981.5s] page\n[1982.9s] 80 paragraph one project that you see\n[1987.6s] this the schools of the\n[1989.4s] prophets there were schools of the\n[1991.8s] prophets at the same time there also\n[1994.5s] schools of the palants\n[1997.5s] now look at the education that was in\n[1999.6s] the schools of the prophets is it there\n[2005.0s] from the specification distinct remain\n[2007.4s] in the scripture from the specification\n[2009.4s] decision made in the scripture from the\n[2012.6s] product that must be passed. It is\n[2015.6s] certain that all we have of life must\n[2019.7s] comprehend the requirements of the\n[2021.6s] king's respect of the king respecting\n[2025.6s] the youth who are to beh\n[2029.7s] and this no small tribute is no small\n[2033.0s] tribute\n[2035.3s] to the educational ideas\n[2038.3s] of\n[2040.0s] king\n[2041.9s] indeed his views of education\n[2045.4s] in this verse as soon in this verse I'm\n[2047.8s] talking Daniel chapter one chapter one\n[2050.2s] from verse four in this verse of the\n[2053.0s] Bible in this verse of the Bible for all\n[2055.6s] practical purposes for in advance for in\n[2059.2s] advance\n[2061.4s] of the educational system that prevents\n[2067.2s] people the kind of the people that\n[2070.5s] require the education was advanced more\n[2073.9s] than the education that people acquire\n[2076.5s] today today today. Hallelujah. Daniel\n[2079.9s] was very wise. Amen. He was very wise\n[2084.4s] and he qualified to be chosen to serve\n[2087.3s] at the king's what palace. Are we\n[2089.2s] together? Now continue reading even\n[2093.4s] in the living colleges. That prevents\n[2098.0s] even the living and universities. The\n[2101.6s] living is universities where United\n[2104.4s] States not\n[2105.6s] even\n[2108.4s] amened what United States. Amen. That is\n[2112.0s] the wherein that proceed in the\n[2116.3s] paragraph that is paragraph three. It\n[2118.2s] says, it\n[2119.6s] says Daniel, where did Daniel and his\n[2123.2s] three companions and his three\n[2124.8s] companions\n[2126.6s] obtain the education which enable them\n[2128.8s] successfully which enable them\n[2130.6s] successfully to pass the examination to\n[2133.2s] pass the examination\n[2140.1s] require that exist of the leading the\n[2143.4s] leading of United where can that\n[2146.3s] education be acquired?\n[2149.4s] them and education which made them\n[2154.0s] skillful and knowledge and understanding\n[2157.9s] science and understanding what science\n[2159.9s] science and which gave them ability and\n[2162.7s] which they gave them ability\n[2165.6s] in all the things\n[2170.0s] withoutation it can be answered but but\n[2173.3s] I like that place I like that place I\n[2175.4s] want you to see But you see people today\n[2178.1s] are talking of the education. You see\n[2180.1s] these things or these things and maybe\n[2181.8s] education of the world. You see this\n[2183.7s] this cameras, this laptop and and we\n[2187.0s] said last time that not every knowledge\n[2189.4s] is from the what? We realize that Satan\n[2193.4s] with and when God has given a knowledge\n[2196.1s] that will help in the taking the gospel\n[2199.0s] of the message people has to accept that\n[2202.7s] knowledge. Are\n[2204.0s] you\n[2211.3s] so I will read your quotation that says\n[2214.2s] that whosoever staples this conviction\n[2216.5s] because it is what inclinations will\n[2220.0s] soon fail to determine between truth\n[2224.8s] and you are my light no\n[2229.4s] without education can be answered it can\n[2232.4s] be answered in the school of the\n[2234.4s] prophets. In the schools of the what?\n[2237.4s] The prophets.\n[2241.1s] He established school in\n[2244.9s] there was at that time there was at that\n[2247.4s] time a school a school of schools of the\n[2251.3s] prophets in Jerusalem in Jerusalem.\n[2254.0s] Hallelujah. So there were schools of the\n[2256.1s] prophets in\n[2257.6s] Jerusalem. Amen. And you remember during\n[2260.1s] the time when the sons of the prophets\n[2262.1s] were going to cut what? Trees. Where\n[2265.0s] were they? In the school of the\n[2267.8s] prophets. Amen. And they were going to\n[2269.8s] build what classics. Amen. They were\n[2272.5s] going to build classes. Where the\n[2276.0s] hallelujah. So green fields, green\n[2278.3s] history will change you. There is\n[2280.8s] something. Have you ever known why\n[2283.3s] there's a a gap between\n[2287.4s] and have you ever known why a\n[2292.8s] gap that is\n[2299.1s] between Greek history that Greek history\n[2303.9s] answers that then I'm looking just\n[2305.4s] example of Christ I'm giving you time\n[2306.9s] for\n[2307.8s] questions 19 get this Get this why there\n[2311.8s] is an ass time between Malachi and the\n[2314.9s] book of Matthew SDP the page is 190\n[2319.2s] paragraph this will tell you about the\n[2322.6s] issue that has happened what God had\n[2325.4s] given to his people and what is\n[2327.5s] happening in this last days it says 192\n[2334.3s] this one is wasting now time let me use\n[2336.7s] this\n[2338.7s] for it has\n[2341.8s] that the inoc\n[2347.0s] the time between the prophecy of Malachi\n[2349.7s] between the prophecy of Malachi and John\n[2352.9s] the Baptist and John the Baptist when is\n[2355.6s] John the history of John the Baptist\n[2357.0s] beginning in the book of Mark Matthew\n[2359.8s] Are you yes\n[2362.8s] continue reading we are now ready we are\n[2366.2s] now ready to appreciate the reason to\n[2368.8s] appreciate The reason Israel why Israel\n[2373.4s] so long was so long without the sound\n[2377.1s] without the sound of the prophet's voice\n[2379.8s] of the prophet's voice God\n[2383.6s] God is a communication system of what\n[2387.9s] education hallelujah how many are seeing\n[2390.3s] the history of the Greece how it\n[2391.6s] appeared in God's word look at this God\n[2394.2s] gave Israel a sense of what education\n[2397.7s] separate and distinct from the system of\n[2402.3s] all other nations. Nations. Hallelujah.\n[2405.6s] So could Israel go to other system of\n[2408.5s] other nations? No.\n[2419.1s] of\n[2422.0s] today. Amen. And we will be putting that\n[2425.5s] verse that is\n[2427.0s] first that we are the people what\n[2431.2s] nations. Uhhuh. Chosen. Chosen what? Is\n[2435.5s] a chosen what? So if the chosen\n[2437.7s] generation seventh day adventist today,\n[2439.9s] God is a separate and distinct the\n[2443.9s] system of all other nation. A system\n[2448.0s] continue a system which ifever\n[2452.9s] would forever make it impossible make it\n[2455.7s] impossible for the people for the people\n[2458.7s] to go into.\n[2463.6s] So they were following\n[2471.4s] it says it says\n[2474.4s] but Israel but Israel\n[2479.5s] gave up a god-given system for teaching\n[2483.9s] for the teaching nation of the hidden\n[2486.6s] what nations. Next it says look at that\n[2489.9s] very painful that however much God gave\n[2492.2s] them a system that was different from\n[2494.8s] all other nations but they gave up to\n[2497.1s] the teachings of other what nations are\n[2499.9s] together they went to another system of\n[2502.0s] what education they copied other nations\n[2505.3s] and allow me tell you how many have ever\n[2507.7s] read the book of numbers chapter\n[2509.8s] 25 chapter 25 what is happening in\n[2512.1s] numbers chapter 25\n[2514.2s] numbers numbers chapter 25 it was even\n[2516.7s] presented Yeah. Ecumenical movement.\n[2518.8s] Ecumenical what? Movement. Do you know\n[2521.2s] the tribe in Israel that led that?\n[2525.0s] The tribe in that was the tribe of\n[2529.5s] Robert. What to\n[2533.4s] birth? What is the birth of education?\n[2536.5s] The science of what? Education. So we\n[2538.9s] are going to join movement after doing\n[2541.7s] what? Selling our birthight. You go to\n[2544.7s] cross and shadow page 288. That one we\n[2548.0s] read paragraph 3. Go to paragraph 4.\n[2550.5s] Read the next you realize that the tribe\n[2552.6s] of the women were the people who went\n[2555.1s] and choose and stay next to Moabites.\n[2559.6s] Are you together? And by that\n[2563.0s] they selling their what? Their so people\n[2566.8s] are going to sell your true science\n[2569.5s] of others.\n[2574.3s] Okay. If we go to the system of other\n[2578.2s] other gods and other gods\n[2583.7s] today, tell me a school today where one\n[2587.3s] god is taught the schools of the world.\n[2598.8s] We are going to go to captivity and\n[2600.6s] number 25 is going to repeat itself\n[2603.2s] itself. It continuc\n[2629.2s] religion. Hallelujah. No one can go to\n[2631.8s] that education and come up with a\n[2634.1s] pure\n[2638.0s] mind. You know that are also using that\n[2640.8s] verse. I always read you that it is only\n[2642.8s] that time is limited. The first\n[2645.4s] principles of\n[2647.4s] the child. If you turn up a child from 1\n[2650.6s] to 12 years you will\n[2653.2s] forever. That is what are saying that is\n[2656.1s] written in fundamental of education\n[2657.9s] where books reading go and get that book\n[2659.9s] to read. You see today elders are coming\n[2662.2s] some elders some are coming and say\n[2664.6s] train up a child. So if you are doing\n[2666.2s] with them they will not do\n[2670.1s] what this\n[2672.4s] is worshiping of God but when they went\n[2676.4s] to they came up\n[2680.3s] with religion. But let me ask you those\n[2683.7s] who obtained their education in the\n[2685.8s] schools of the prophets like Daniel were\n[2688.6s] they simulated with that system of\n[2690.0s] education? No. Were they impressed by\n[2692.8s] that religion? No. When you teach Daniel\n[2695.8s] chapter 3, they refused to bow down what\n[2699.4s] to the idol. Are you so going to\n[2703.2s] under\n[2704.8s] go the beast and let the change and the\n[2708.2s] grace of God be sufficient to the unto\n[2710.3s] them. Hallelujah. Somebody is sleeping\n[2713.1s] in this class. Just wake up a man. The\n[2716.6s] grace of God is sufficient to those who\n[2718.3s] sleeping. Hallelujah. So it continues by\n[2720.4s] saying I won't finish.\n[2722.6s] It continues by saying uh Jews return\n[2725.8s] from Babylon. Jews return from Babylon.\n[2730.0s] Babylonian ideas of education and\n[2732.9s] religion. This prepared\n[2736.9s] them with readiness. The teaching of the\n[2740.2s] the teachings of the Greeks.\n[2743.3s] A question. What have we read that the\n[2745.5s] teaching of the Greek is leading to? I\n[2748.1s] do\n[2749.4s] not. I I when somebody is trying to\n[2753.4s] understand phenomena of the earth\n[2755.3s] without the\n[2763.7s] Bible in\n[2766.0s] that age. So they were able to accept\n[2769.8s] the teachings of the Greek. The Greeks\n[2791.7s] continually from\n[2794.4s] Malachi of John the Baptist.\n[2797.8s] family\n[2807.2s] go and read others for yourself. Amen.\n[2809.7s] Amen. By the\n[2811.6s] way, what made\n[2815.5s] you follow the\n[2817.8s] system? But you\n[2819.9s] know, God has arrived to do what worship\n[2824.7s] him. So there were those who remained\n[2827.3s] and remain steadfast to the system. I'm\n[2830.2s] looking up Christ as an example. Then\n[2832.0s] I'm giving time for prayers. Christ as\n[2834.1s] an example. The book of that is first\n[2836.6s] Peter 2 verse 21. The Bible says the\n[2839.9s] following\n[2843.0s] words 2 verse 21 says the Bible reads\n[2847.4s] the\n[2849.9s] reads uh 2\n[2854.0s] 2 Uh-huh. Because Uh-huh. Because Christ\n[2857.8s] also suffered for us. Because Christ\n[2859.7s] also suffered for us. Living as an\n[2861.8s] example. Living as an example. That you\n[2864.9s] should follow. That you should follow\n[2867.1s] what? Yes. That Christ left an example\n[2869.6s] that you should follow what?\n[2876.8s] First John 2 verse 6.\n[2882.0s] It says, It says John 2 verse 6. Uh-huh.\n[2887.0s] Uh-huh. He that he abideth in him. He\n[2889.9s] that he abideth in\n[2892.0s] himself to walk\n[2895.1s] even walk as he walk. Hallelujah. How\n[2899.0s] many love that\n[2900.4s] verse? How many love that verse? And\n[2903.3s] when you can preach that verse, you will\n[2905.5s] talk of Christ humility. Hallelujah. You\n[2909.2s] talk of Christ kindness. Amen.\n[2912.8s] Will you mention that in that verse?\n[2915.8s] Hallelujah. Amen. Will you mention\n[2917.8s] those? But people always mention the\n[2923.8s] Christ. Do we always mention the Christ?\n[2927.4s] But what the Bible says is that we read\n[2930.6s] again. It says it says he that abided\n[2935.5s] him abided in him. God himself to walk\n[2938.9s] him even as he walked.\n[2940.5s] All you want to say so\n[2944.4s] Christ, you talk of Christ, you talk of\n[2948.4s] Christ, you talk of\n[2950.6s] Christy, you talk of\n[2958.8s] Christ verse\n[2966.2s] 28, the Bible say the mans\n[2970.4s] And when they saw him, And when they saw\n[2972.6s] him, they were amazed. They were amazed.\n[2974.7s] And his mother said unto him, And his\n[2976.5s] mother said unto him, Son, why\n[2980.6s] this the Bible? It says, son, why hast\n[2984.4s] thou dealt with us? Behold, thy father\n[2987.7s] and household this. Uhhuh. I'm checking\n[2991.0s] the verse where it says that and the\n[2992.5s] child grew 40. The Bible says the child\n[2996.2s] and the child grew what strong in spirit\n[2998.6s] and what strong in spirit that is Jesus\n[3001.5s] Christ filled with wisdom. Filled with\n[3003.8s] what? Wisdom. Filled with what? Wisdom.\n[3006.3s] Wisdom. And the grace of God was upon\n[3008.7s] you. And the grace of God was upon him.\n[3011.8s] Christ was also filled with what?\n[3013.5s] Wisdom. He now Christ was is our\n[3017.1s] example. And if you're buying in Christ,\n[3019.0s] we need to follow the step of Christ.\n[3021.5s] Look at this. I'm reading this\n[3024.3s] pages page 9 page 7 69 paragraph 3 then\n[3028.9s] I paragraph one then I pray listen to\n[3032.0s] the following\n[3036.6s] words in the in the name of\n[3042.9s] Christ for religious instruction for\n[3045.7s] that that did not provide for religious\n[3048.3s] instruction of the young regard\n[3051.2s] was regarded\n[3052.8s] under of God. Next\n[3058.0s] statement had become for\n[3062.0s] tradition in a great degree supplanted\n[3065.6s] supplanted what? The script. That is the\n[3068.2s] name of Christ. That tradition\n[3070.9s] supplanted the what? The script.\n[3073.4s] Hallelujah. So the only thing that could\n[3075.1s] be lifted\n[3076.3s] is tradition more than script\n[3078.9s] scriptures. Uhhuh.\n[3087.9s] [Music]\n[3089.8s] by these teachers. But the next paragon\n[3098.7s] receive instruction in the synagogue in\n[3101.8s] the synagogue schools in the synagogue\n[3103.6s] schools. His mother was his first human\n[3106.2s] was his first human teacher from the\n[3110.6s] scorn of\n[3112.8s] the mother the mother of Jesus used the\n[3116.2s] syllabus of the education of the prop\n[3118.4s] the schools of the prop the same thing\n[3120.5s] that was taught to Daniel was taught to\n[3122.5s] whom Christ amen that is why Christ was\n[3126.2s] very very\n[3127.6s] wise his wisdom exceeded the wisdom of\n[3132.5s] the universities of United States. Amen.\n[3135.4s] My time is running fast. I want to stop.\n[3137.8s] Amen. So this subject is some sometimes\n[3140.6s] interesting that I begin reading\n[3142.6s] something. I realize that time man.\n[3144.6s] Amen. But God may God be the help follow\n[3148.0s] Christ before those who successfully\n[3151.0s] mission movement in Jesus name. Amen.\n[3153.8s] Allow me then I need time for questions.\n[3156.6s] I'm praying.\n[3168.0s] Thank you for the system education that\n[3170.8s] you given to the\n[3173.8s] Israelites.\n[3175.3s] We also were able to study and their\n[3178.6s] wisdom exed all other wisdom that could\n[3181.1s] be in the world. That is the wisdom we\n[3183.8s] require today as people to make sure\n[3187.4s] that we have a character paid for it.\n[3190.1s] Help us dear Lord in heaven to make a\n[3192.6s] step of\n[3194.5s] faith to\n[3196.4s] do the call that you're doing over us to\n[3199.6s] education. Dear all heaven as you shall\n[3201.9s] be looking other things are to be\n[3203.9s] established. God we pray that you may\n[3206.2s] help us have a people who are going to\n[3208.9s] stand for this for I pray in Jesus name.\n[3212.0s] Amen. Amen."

We being told about William Miller. As a little boy, William Miller lived on a farm in eastern New York. And on and let me read 16.3 16 AP BP AP BP AP BP. Sir, you are also going to write that William was a Baptist. He was in Baptist church. He was a Baptist. And I want to read to you because William Miller, we're being told that at one time when God is using William Miller, there reach a time that William Miller discarded or William Miller at one point neglected or doubted the principle of the B of the Bible whom God used to establish the foundation of our faith. There was at one time he doubted the principles of God or the Bible of God, the Bible of God. And when we will look at it parallel to the Israelites to the uh the parallel of the or Israelites movement, we are going to determine some of the sweet things. And we being told that when William Miller when he was a youth, he he came in contact with those who neglected the oracles of God. The day east Let me read. William Miller had a strong religious background but he become attached to the wrong crowd. His friends were ded. The these people set aside the Bible and had valued idea about God and his personality. It means that that they discarded what the Bible God and also the personality of God the personality of God and when William Miller get in contact with them. William Miller also take their beliefs and William Miller also neglected or he did not what he he did not believe the oracles of God. The oracles of God. Let me proceed. But Miller was always a man of high moral character. What he failed to find in relig religion he sought to find in high and patriot patriotic attainment. He served his country as an officer in the war in 1812. So William Miller was an army officer and the year 1812 he served as an army officer. I know you should write those things in 18 of as an early officer and also he was also a con constable sim. Yes. And also he was a justice of peace. He was he was doing three roles in that community in the year 1812. before that in the year 1812 you're finding that he did not believe the oracles of God and he was serving as an army officer and also when you are writing you also write that the father of William Miller was also an army officer and William Miller also serve as an army officer is served with distinction later in home community served as a justice of peace and his associations with his brethren but there A time after the war in the year 1812 when brother Miller when that war was finished the mother of Miller was widowed and the father of Miller was the father of milad died finding that Miller take his time Miller is going back home that he may stay and be a farmer and after we are finding that Miller being a farmer because of his mother because he loved his mother so much he tried to take time and go to what? To the Baptist church. And when you get to the Baptist church where his uncle was a preacher, there was no preacher. There were sometimes even the deacons were given printed sermon to preach. There were children given printed sermons to preach. But William Miller is not like that. But his motions, he he really liked the oracles of God. But after going to the Baptist church because of the emotions all because of being drawn by his mother who was widowed when he got back home he there was no preacher in that church. Then there was one Sunday which William Miller was given a sermon printed sermon to go and do what? print and sermon to go and uh to go and present and after being given print and sermon William started to believe the Bible and to ask the qu the question of the Bible. Let me uh proceed by reading when William was 34 years of age he become dissatisfied with his views. The Holy Spirit impressed in heart and it turned to the study of the word of God. In this in this book, Jesus was revealed to him as his savior. He found in Christ the answer to all his needs. He determined to study the Bible carefully and to determine if he could the answer to many problem that he had perplexed him. His studies led him to great prophecies that pointed to the first and to the second advent of our law of our Lord. When William Miller was studying the prophecy, he go to the study of the Bible. You're right. In the year 1816, William Miller started studying the oracles of God. In the year 1816, he ventured now to study and to know what is contained in the word of God, the word of God. And he was studying step by step. When Miller Miller started with Genesis 1 verse one, he cannot go to Genesis 1 verse number two. Without understanding Genesis chapter 1 verse number one, one without understanding it's saying the time prophesied interested him particularly the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation. He studied and what did William Miller use when studying the Bible? There were William Miller rules in studying the B the Bible. He had rules and there's a book written by William Miller on rules of interpreting the Bible in the blue estate. If you find time get time to study the rules but he was using something called conudin or conco concordance. Do we know the concordance? explain that was the Bible. What was Miller using or the crudence or concordance and very interesting that when William Miller was studying Daniel and Revelation, he read them. But while getting to the book of Daniel 8 verse number 14, the foundation of the Adventist movement is being established. In the only Daniel 8 verse number 14 is what has made a seventh day advent. Let us read Daniel 8 verse number 14. Daniel 8 verse number 14. The Bible says and he said unto him unto 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. When William Miller reached in Daniel 8 verse number 14, God has been sending his his angels to guide to instructing in the oracles of God. But when he reached the year 18, he reached what? Daniel 8:14, William read that unto 2,300 days shall the sanctuary be then interpreted that the sanctuary is the church and that church is in this earth. So it means that after 2,300 days this earth will be clear cleansed. It means that when this earth is going to be cleansed, it is going to be cleansed with fire. And when he was also reading the Bible, he is finding that that is the it means that the second advent of of Christ, it means then William Miller interpreted that what will be the end of this 2,300 days? What was the the end of this 2,300 days? Then he tried to interpret. I want you to write the first interpretation of Miller. The first interpretation of me. The first interpretation of me. Let me go to 16 number five as I tell you something. It say uh the book that I was reading it say that in the year 1818. So you're right. He started reading the Bible 1816 and the year 1818 he reached the conclusion that after after how many days? 18:18 that Christ will be coming how many days before him? 25 day 25 years within 25 years Christ will be coming. You write that 1818 read that after 25 years Christ will be coming. He come to the conclusion that Christ will come sometimes in the year 1843 or 1844. And you read that between you write March 25, 1843 to March 21st 1844 Christ will be coming between those days between those days between those months that Christ will be coming. That was the first interpretation of me not 1844 not October 1844. No the is first interpretation was that from March 1821st to March March 21st 1844 Christ will be coming. Christ will be coming. That was his first interpretation. And uh me I think that if I was in the time of William I could have believed. I want to I want to establish for you why because William studied thoroughly the Bible. There were signs of time that way. I've taken time that we may read we may sing Psalm 212 and I will read it once more and try to to tell you what was it evidence and try to ask you that if it was you could you not believe then let me let me proceed then that in the year 18 in the year 1818 that it was the conclusion of of William Miller that in 25 years Christ will appear. Can you put for me great controversy page 329.2 329.2 that we may read together as we proceed. GC 329.2 GC329.2 I'm only reading the first word she's saying you see 329.2 two, he had devoted two years to the study of the Bible when in 1818 he reached the solemn conviction that in about 24 years Christ will appear for the redemption of his people. Are we okay? That in about 24 years Christ will be appear for redemption of his what? Of his people. Are we see CCP we are preaching that Christ will appear? It is soon to appear also. This the message that we are preaching is the message that William Miller preached. William Miller preached. But when William Miller the conclusion in the year 1818, he started sharing it to his friend that Christ will appear 25 years later. But he had not he did not publicly pronounce he did not publicly go and start preaching that Christ is coming. But he said that what if I'm in error? What if I'm in error? What if I mislead souls? That was the question which was disturbing William and he start discussing it with friends. But in the year 1831 is the first time that William Miller go publicly to what to proclaim that Christ is coming. Right. In the year 1831, in the year 1831, in the year 1831, then William in the first time publicly give the reason of his faith. How many years from year 1816 to the year 1831? How many years did he devoted in studying the scriptures before publicly pronouncing? It is 15 years. Maybe maybe someone is taking one month and another could really that Christ is coming. But William Miller devoted 15 years before publicly proclaiming and the William Miller heart was being disturbed. God was talking to William Miller that go and proclaim to my people the message that I have given you. William Miller was not in heresy but God sent his angel to guide William Miller. He was not in what? Heresy. He was not in heresy. And we're being told that after William Miller, there was a time that when he was talking to God, he's saying that God, when I will be called, when I will be called to preach this truth, I will do, I will go. And on that on that time, on that day, there was a Baptist preacher who came and invited him to preach a sermon. And that was the first time in the year 1831 that you do what? You take time to establish the reason of his faith. And also that is in the great controversy page 330 paragraph number two. You write great controversy page 330. The paragraph is paragraph number two. And I will read as it ends as it ends. I'm not going for uh 1831. Are you seeing for 9 years? Let me start with let me start the words. The words you can the words were ever recurring to his mind. These were the words which angels were telling the William go and tell it to the world. Their blood will I require at thy who guided William? It means that God guided that he was he was coming in the year 18 but he forced through the ministation of the holy angels we will read the in the writings I know we are coming it's saying for 9 years he waited the burden still pressing upon his soul until in 1831 he for the first time publicly gave the reason of his way publicly gave the reason of is what is faith that is in the year 1831 and from that time was being called from every hand from every every hand and he was alone we going to determine that it is until 18 1838 that we find another associate of William but for all those what 1831 to 183 1839 how many years 8 years he was only preaching alone we are going to find the associates of William Miller. But that was in the year 1831 he first publicly given the reason of his faith and also right in the year 1843. In the year 1843 in the year 1843 that is great controversy. You can move to great controversy 332.1. 332.1 it says that in 1833 Miller received a license to preach from the Baptist church of which he was a member. So we are writing the year 1833 William received a license as a minister of the Baptist church to preach after him giving the evidence of his faith that truly Christ is coming 25 years before me. Christ is coming. He received a license. A large number of ministers of Islam denomination also approved his work and he it was with their formal sanction that he continue his labor. He received what alliances. I know I will try when we are looking for the birth and the progress of the remnant church. We will look about the ordination and the credentials also in the seventh adventist church because we are having ordination and credential Sabbath before us. And I would like that before we reach on that Sabbath where we will have ordination and credential, we will try to look the birth and the progress of seventh adventist about ordination, about credentials and about who to be ordained, who to baptize, why baptism, if I will only find time. But William Miller was given license in the year 1833 by the Baptist church, recognized by ministers and members of what? Members of his church. And I know we have been reading it is Christ in his sanctuary 87.1. This is the foundation of faith. C I H SS 87.1 C IH SS87 number one he said the the scripture above all other the scriptures which above all other had been both the foundation and the central pillar of the Adventist faith. So what is our foundation? Our central pillar. You know I can talk of the Adventist movement but when I do not look the foundation when I do not pass to William Miller and the winnerite movement I have not talk of the Adventist movement. And I want you to have a clear understanding. It say that the scripture above all other had been both the foundation and the central pill of the Adventist way. What the is correlation and to 2,300 days since then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. That is our foundation. That is our central pill. It means that when you want to finish the seven adventist church, don't go to the personality of God. Don't go don't go to the Sabbath, but come unto our central pill. You only remove what? You only remove the sanctuary and the adventist movement is finished. And when you come also with 2520 that is sanctuary you have removed what? You have removed seventh adventist. Why am I saying so? That was unto the declaration of 2,300 days of the sanctuary be cleansed. That is our central pillar of the Adventist movement. When you do not understand that, read with me. Ali writing 63. Ali writing 63.2. 63.2. I want you to post it in screen quickly. Ali writing 63. 63.2. I want you to read with me. Ali writing 63. Paragraph is paragraph number two. And readly read. It say, can you read with me? Uh, but such subjects of the sanctuary in connection with 2300 days, the commandment of God and the per and the faith of Jesus are perfectly calculated to explain the past Adventist movement and show what our present position is. When we want to look the past Adventist movement and our history, we go to the sanctuary and 2300 days as we are connecting with three angels message about the commandment of God and the faith of Jesus. That is our foundation. That is our foundation. And when William Miller was doing what was establishing his faith, there was a book written by William being written science of times. When it was written science of time of January 1843, William Miller read this said this word. He said I want to quote you for the words of William Miller, not mine. is saying that I am fully convinced that I am fully convinced I don't know I let me project for you it is being written a prophet among you a p a y a prophet among you know I will take much of the time also reading prophet a prophet among you it's a serious book if you go to blue estate you will see you write a p a y a prophet among you 193 paragraph number Can you hear these words of William Miller? When William Miller stand to preach, no man can gain say with the oracles and I want to establish the sermon of William Miller. AP AY 193.1 Can you put we read together with my friends? It is not there. Let me read as you searching in the other world. AP AE read in signs of times of January 25, 1843, William Miller declared, I am fully convinced that sometime between March 21st, 1843 and March 25, 1844, according to the Jewish mode of computation of time, Christ will come. The months of 1843 and 1844 rolled by with increased expectancy on the part of the believers in the advent. The proceeding were watched by many unbelieving of sabans and kept skeptism prejudice or moary grieve. William Miller is writing that in January 25 that I'm fully convinced that March 21st 1843 to March 21st 1844 Christ will appear. But there were a lot of prejudices. There were lot of skepticism. But the sad thing that the years the mans keep scrolling that when they were looking in 1843 1844 21st they are not seeing Christ coming but there was something there was a point which William me because let me read may you mark this my word he's saying the majority however although discouraged and disappointed I'm reading my quote which I I put it say the majority however although discourage and disappointment still believed that the advent was to be expected at any moment praise God that in the first word the first interpretation of me the first interpretation of me we are being told that people were not being discouraged by the great disappointment but they believe that in a moment later Christ is going to appear it's say that manfully Miller admitted that he had been in error but he also called the believer's attention to Abak 2:3 let us read when 1840 uh vers 25 1844 passed William came and read in the book of Abak 2:3 that indeed I am correct when I'm looking for the signs of times I'm seeing that Christ is going to appear When I'm reading the sun, I'm reading the stars. Christ is really going to do what? To appear. But 25 1844 is passing. They are not seeing any moment that Christ is doing what? Christ is coming. Then he's going to use scripture and will a man of scriptures, a man of evidences come to the book of Habac 2:3 and try also to start encouraging his people that the vision is for the time appointed. Yet the vision may yet Christ is going to but it is for appointed time. Let you read with me saying for the vision is yet for an time appointed uh for appointed time but at the end of it shall pick and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t that you know from March 21st to 1844 they were entering something called the taring the ting time have you ever read about the taring time and also So because I I will get to to I will get time to speak about the the midnight cry and also when we are looking about the Matthew 25 verse number one as we going down about the 10 virgins there was also a ting time about the ting time the also the adventist movement they enter what is called the ting time they are being told that the vision is for appointed time yet it may be delayed But it will come. It will come. They enter the tearing time. And in that turning time, in that period is what we are also finding the midnight cry. I know I'm going to read when I get time, I will read about the midnight cryog that I may bring it to your mind. Then it continued by saying the vision though it t because it will surely come soon. The adventist papers were filled with reference to the ting time that from the year 184 March 25 every papers was being written a topic called the ting time. It continued by saying speak of Christ parable of the 10 virgin. Millerite lecture suddenly discovered that BC to AD system of chronology allowed no zero year that when William Miller was trying to write because I don't want to teach on the 2300 days because time is limited but we are finding that it started from 457 BC then he was prolonging that line to the year 1843 he calculated by 2300 days but he made a mistake of writing zero year that was the mistake but he come to that indeed there's no zero here when you come to 1 BC you go to 1 A but one what 1 BC C one Z BC but there was not that time then when you calculate 457 2300 days in 1840 1843 but I come to realing time that Christ is coming in the year 18 18 what 44 you only had one year then you read now the conclusion the present standing of me now was indeed when I'm looking for the signs of time in the year 1844 we are going to seeing the son of man coming the son of man coming but I want to bring into your mind that William Miller was I I don't he was correctly interpreting that crisis was Come here. Let me read for you. I will. Can you write a subtopic? The sixth seal. What the interpretation of I tried to determine to you what William Miller established his teaching because not let me let us go Revelation 6. When William Miller read the book of Revelation, this was what he read. William uh Revelation 6 verse number 12. And I'm not going to read uh I want you now to be keen writer. I'm going to read some of the scriptures and spirit of prophecy. You might not, you may not. Then you are going to read at your own your own time. But can you see if this is our interpretation how William interpreted the Bible? He's saying this is a six seal and I beheld. You can put it here to Oh. So read your Bible. Go with me in Revelation 6:12. Let me tell you that the six we have how many seals? Seven seal. But what what is of the seventh seal? The seven. You know it the journey to heaven. It is being talked about journey to heaven. It means that indeed now we are on the sixth seal. And also when we want to understand that Christ is coming, we go to the sixth because after the sixth in Aisha to Eevee, we are going to the journey to heaven. And it say Revelation 6:12. And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was great, right? The interpretation of first, there was great, and the sun became black as soft clothes of, and the moon became as blood. Mhm. And the stars of heaven fell unto them even as the fig tree cast her anti untimely figs when she is taken of the mighty wind. So that is the sixth scene. The sixth is continue by saying and the heaven departed as scroll that is the coming of Christ when it is rolled together and every mountain and Islams were moved on uh of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men of the chief of captain and the mighty men everyone bondage and everyone free hide themselves to the rocks. That is the coming of who? The coming of Christ. It mean that William is reaching the conclusion that the signs of time which I'm going to use is Christ is coming and when Christ is coming we have not been given definite time but Christ was telling his disciple about the signs of times that after this signs of times Christ is coming here in the Christ is coming in revelation 6:14 s Christ is coming in revelation 6:14 and only revelation 6:12 and 13 you are being told about the signs of times that's why the Millerite song of 212 let me read something for you Millerite movement song 612 he's saying that it is almost time for the Lord to come 212 it is almost time for the Lord to come I hear the people say the stars of heaven are growing dim it must be the breaking of the day the signs for In the sun and moon, in the earth and sea and sky, a loud proclaimed to all mankind the coming of the master draweth. It means that that is their song that Christ is coming. When we look for the signs in the sky, in the moon, in the stars, Christ is coming. We are finding some things the interpretation of Mamela in the signs of times. Do they happen before 1844? Can you read first? We are finding about first sign which happen is about the earthquake that fact the first time which means that Christ is coming is there will be a great earthquake did it happened so you write first the great earthquake the great earthquake first the great earthquake you read we read great controversy 304.2 GC 304.2 GC 304.2 2 you see the interpretation of me what happened GC 304.2 We want to see when was correct in his interpretation. Three or four paragraph is paragraph number two. He's saying this these signs of times these signs were witnessed before the opening of the 9th century. In the fulfillment of this prophecy, they occurred in the year 1755. The most terrible earthquake that has ever been recorded. Praise God. So before 1844 in the year 1755 there was a great earthquake which is being named the Lisbon earthquake. Are we okay? That is the first signs of times that William Miller was doing what William was using. So you write though commonly known as the earthquake of Lisbon it extended in the part of Europe Africa and America it was felt in Greenland in the west in Indies in the east island of there are many country and it was felt it was worldwide it means that the first signs of time that will in the book revelation 6 verse 12 that there will be great earthquake. So you write in the year 1755 the first signs of times is the Lisbon Lisbon earthquake recorded in great controversy 304 it say in revelation 6:12 and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal there was a great earthquake and the sun became the sun became black as the s close of air that is sign number These were the interpretation of Miller that the sun became blackened as what? The sun. When did the sun became blackened? Huh? You give me evidence. I want evidence. Not when did the sun became blackened? Read with me. Great controversy. I want you to write the 306 306.1 the blackening of the sun or the dark the dark day and moon and moon May you write May 17th May 19th 178 I want you to go to the last part of it 306.1 is 6.1 you write on May 19, 1780. That is the second time, the second sign which is being which we are being told that when you shall see the earthquake when you shall see a great earthquake not only earthquake but a great earthquake of Lisbon which happened. William will say that Christ is coming. When you shall see what the the dark day and when the moon will become as blah as blood Christ is doing what was William Miller wrong because this thing happened you it says that on 19th of May 1780 this prophecy was fulf Okay. 19th May 17 18. But there's something which is remarkable which I do not want to copy it. Let us go to Matthew. It is Matthew 24:39. Matthew 24:39. You I want you to not a point in connection with 12 because when we are reading of what? When we are reading of 2300 days, we are finding that also 12 of 60 days is in 2300 day days. It means that for William Miller to understand 2300 days it means also he fully understand what 1260 days then Matthew which is tens of times when we read also when we are reading what gospel workers page 148.2 True. It means that what should be brought in the mind of people is the book of revelation Daniel and Matthew 24. Matthew 24. It mean that also used Matthew chapter 24. But there's something so interesting. Matthew 24:29. Read with me keenly in that immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be blackened darkened and the moon shall not give her and the star shall fall from and the powers of the heaven shall be and then shall appear the signs of the son of man in heaven. It means that after Matthew 24:29 Christ is appearing. So you what it say that after tribulation s and this tribulation it is 12 60 days Christ is going to happen. What is going to appear? Not a Christ the dark day. The dark day is India. It means that it means that the persecution could before what? Before 1780 because 1260 days in that the persecution 1798 but the powers of persecution is before what? before before 7 before 1780 because Bible is not wrong because Christ is saying that unless those days be shortened no man shall be saved. It means that I want you also to write this that in the year 1776 the year 1776 this is SSP the story of the seat patos 120 paragraph number one 120 paragraph number one 120 paragraph number I want to read between the lines not to take much of the time see 120.1 is But God in mercy shortened the time of persecution. For except those days shall be shortened, no flesh shall be saved. The persecuting powers of the papacy was broken out in 1776. It means that before 1798 the persecution power was broken but when reaching 1780 the sun the sun became blackened. I also great controversy also 306 number one say you're right because my time is spent the 12 of 60 days of the year terminated in 1798 that is the correct interpretation a quarter of century earlier persecution had almost wholly ceased following this persecution according to the words of Christ so 1798US 2573 It means between 1773 to 1776 persecution that's why after tribulation in 1780 we are being told that the what is coming the day to be blah bl you will read much but I'm only giving you the evidences of William and also the third interpretation about the falling of the stars so this was his climax that when stars in a fall to evil rises at the at the door. You read with me great controversy 333.1 GC 333.1 you write the falling of the stars in November 13th you write November 13th 1833 we are seeing the falling of the stars November 13th 184 1833 we are seeing the falling of the stars after the falling of the stars Christ is coming in the year 1844 was William Miller You cannot answer this prophecy that is revelation 6:13 about the falling of the star. We being told that this prophecy it say that this prophecy received a striking of the greatest metoic shower of November 13,833. You will read as you go downward. Meic shower that is what? The falling of the stars that was the last which was being used. It means that William Miller was correct in his interpretation that Christ is soon what is soon coming. There's also last thing that also when William Miller combined with his associates which is who which is it is Josiah le it is Josiah le uh in the because they also interpretated in the year 1838 that when it will reach August 11 1840 there will be the fall of the Ottoman Empire that is in the book of revelation 9 from verse number 19 to verse number 21 and when you come from Revelation 9 19-21 when you are going to the revelation chapter 10 you are being told that they had been given a voice to go and proclaim the first and the second angels message. So you have read about the Ottoman Empire about the church the fall of the Ottoman Empire when the August 18 August 11 1840 you can write that the fall of the Ottoman Empire was also the interpretation which happened in August 11th 1840 if you get time you can read on it on SP78.2 too. You can read the fall of the Ottoman Empire which gave them now the people now believed that the interpretation are what? The interpretation are sure. The interpretation are sure. It means that Miller was correct in his what? In his interpretation. William Miller correct in his interpretation. It means that God had been leading his people. But when we will go to understand we will go to that where why did not Christ do what? Why did not Christ do what did not Christ come? And when we want to know our faith when we want to know the seventh adventist movement it is at the great disappointment that seventh adventist was esta established. It was through the labor of William Miller that our faith was established because God has been leading his people. God has been leading his people. And I know we will have a subtopic and you can also write about about about the Miller and Moses. There's a serious striking similarity that as Moses because I was really impressed by the sermon of of brother Maxwell. I will read those things once more. I will read them once more. He give me now easy time of explaining the striking similarity of the Adventist movement and of the Millerite movement and of Miller. He tried to explain to me but let me tell you that William Miller was correct. And when you want to know that our faith is being established in the Millerite movement, we are also going to look to the as Israelites the Israelites movement that as God led William Miller. So God has led who Moses Moses I know as we will be going also the birth and the progress of the Adventist movement as is apostasy. What will help us so much to have the correct interpretation is about what? It's about the history of the Israelites and the Adventist what movement. Can you write that? The striking similarity of the Israelites and the Adventist movement. Striking similarity. I'm only going that subtopic and introduction then I finish because my time is spent. My time is spent for you to give me easy time and you go and study for yourself. There's something which are being told in great controversy page 457 conclude we will know. Coming to we going to know about the milite movement clearly and if I find time we will talk of the mill associates someone like Josiah lech snow also Joseph snowh who again Charles F who again we are going to look for Yeah. Yes. James White also was associate of William. We will also look for the division among the milit. The division in the milite movement. But read for with me great controversy page 457. The paragraph is paragraph number one. I think so. 457.1. How many minutes do I have? 15 minutes. Thank you so much. 457 paragraph number one. As I look for the the Millerite movement in biblical concept. The Millerite movement in biblical concept. 457 paragraph is paragraph number two. Go with me. Paragraph number two. Paragraph number two. Paragraph number two. He's saying I want you to clearly understand this quotation because it will help us in our study. He's saying we are studying on church heritage or the history of the church. We're being told that the history of the ancient Israelites is a striking illustration of the past experience of the Adventist B. So it means that when you put the history of the ancient Israel this side and also when you put the history of the Adventist movement this side they are striking illustration. That's why I don't want to go to the midnight cry before I come to this that their history is parallel. It continued by saying God led his people in the adventist movement even has he led the children of Israelites from Egypt. It means that as God led his children in the Adventist movement, it is the same way he led his children in from Egypt. In the great disappointment, you can write one thing here because I cannot know because we have Egypt Syri. We are going to look that it resembled the midnight cry. We have the Red Sea you can write which resembles what the great disappointment. We also have what? We have also the rebellion at Kesh Bar which happened in the year 1888. We have also the apostasy at Jordan which is our omega of apostasy. Are we clear? which is our mega of apostasy. We will determine. Let me go. In the great disappointment, their faith was tested as that of the Hebrews in the Red Sea. So there is a striking similarity in the great disappointment which we look and also the testing in the Red Sea. It continued by saying that had they still trusted to the guiding hand that had been with them in their past experience, they would have seen the salvation of God. If all who had labor unitedly in the work in 1844 had received the third angel's message and proclaimed to the power of the spirit, the Lord will have wrote the mighty works of their effort effort. It mean that when William the third angel's message, it mean that we could have been in heaven now. Praise God. We could have been in what? In heaven. It means that when we are looking also for the history, we also go to the history of the of the of the Israelites and understand clearly that this church is a church led by God. See church. And yet we have just come here to to put our things that we believe this and this but we we have dived them from the scripture 2M 399 399.1 number one 2M 399 number one 3991 I want you also to understand this so I'm not too kind I'm Sorry. 3SM 3SM399 number one. It says 3SM3991 is saying that there should be a constant walking in humility. There there should be no just occasion for our Uhhuh. Let me look for the the point which I want. The point which I want the point which I want. Mhm. the point which I want the point which I want but I'm not getting in here but we can get it in the book education I highlighted it by in the book of education 178 I will give you that that 3SM but education 178 also put it clearly when I'm not finding inm let me read in the education education 178 number three 178 number three we are being told that the history with the that am had marked out in his word, uniting link after link in the prophetic chain from eternity in the past to eternity in the future. Tell us where we are today in this procession of the ages and what may be expected in the time to come. All that prophecy had foretold as coming to pass and in the present time has been traced on the pages of the history and we may be assured that all we which is yet to come will be fulfilled in order. It mean that the history which the greater put in the ancient Israelites it is a prophetic chain. It is a chain. It is running in chain after chain chain after chain. and also how God has led his children. His children how God has led his children. Because when we are looking for the Adventist movement, when we will go to the midnight cry, we are finding that when God when we think about Israelites, we are seeing only Moses. So no one can mention Israelites before mentioning Mo Moses. Am I okay? Also no one can mention seventh adventist without talking of the Millerite movement. Without talking on the Millerite movement. Can you write the parallel of Moses and me? As I finishing that the parallel of Moses and me that I may have easy time in the next lesson not to have much of time. The parallel of Moses and Miller. I know you have right about Miller being army officer and becoming a farmer. If you read alo it is also being told in one bio 19.4. about the army officer and then becoming a farm in but there's a parallel of Moses and Miller first you should write that both were called by God to lead his people both were called by God to lead his people Moses to lead God first church and Miller to lead God's last remnant church are we okay that as God called Miller to lead God's remnant church as also God called Moses to lead his church from the wilderness. We are going to see how they were were they called. Number two, that both were intelligent. Both were intelligent. Both were intelligent. The book CTR 100 CDR 100 CDR both were intelligent. CTR page number 100. Thank you. CTR page 100 number three is saying that Moses was a man of intelligence and God in purpose in his providence placed him where he could acquire knowledge and fitness for the great work. He was thoroughly educated as a general when he went out to meet his enemy. William was an army. He was an army officer. And also Moses first he was intelligent. Number two he was educated in in military training. He was educated in military training. Are we seeing that second parallel striking similarity? Are we seeing it? That striking similarity the same. Amen. Are we seeing that similarity? Both were called by God. Both both were intelligent. Let me read for you of William GC. You you you confirm GC37.2 Great Controversy 317.2 Great Controversy page 317 paragraph 2. Can you see this? William Moses was intelligent. Number two, he was trained in military training or he was trained as a general of the army officers. Read this GC 317.2. William Miller, he had a sound physical constitution and even in childhood he gave evidence of more than ordinary intellectual train. Praise God. Was Millia intelligent? Was Moses intelligent? Was Miller an army officer? Was was Moses an army officer? Was were they educated in military line? It means that we are we are on the right path of calling ourself Israelites movement syndrome. You write point number three. Read point number three. Read point number three. Both were uh taught and protected by angels. Both were taught and protected by angels. Both were taught by and protected by angels. PP 245 paragraph number two. PP 245 paragraph number two. PP 245 paragraph number two. Can you see 245 paragraph number two is saying that the the elders of Israelites were taught the elders of Israeli Israel were taught by angels that the time for their deliverance was near and that Moses to accomp that Moses was the man whom God will employ to accomplish this work. Angels instructed Moses also that Jehovah had chosen him to break the bondage of his people. Who instructed Moses? Who instructed Moses? What about William Miller? Ali writings 229. You see these are some of the simple striking similarity. Ali writings 229. Can you see this also? Can you see this also? You know that we are 229 paragraph number one. Can you see it's saying that God sent his angel to move upon the heart of what? A farmer who had not believed the B the Bible to lead him to search the prophecy. Angels of God repeated revisited that chosen one to guard his mind and to open to his understanding the prophecies which has ever been dark to the to God's people. Those were instructed and taught by angels. Another one let me ask you first William was a military Moses was also military. What is agricult? It means that everything will be okay. Let me read the last one. This I will read. Both s not the promised land and both are going to heaven. Praise God. Both s not the promised land but both are all going to we are going to meet William Miller in heaven. Praise God. But Moses is in heaven right now. Let me give you one evidence. Early writings p 257 258. You also understand that as we are understanding that there's a striking similarity between William Miller and Moses Oen White understood it that way. Early writings page page 250 258 258 paragraph number one as I conclude as I go to conclusion it say this was a mistake done by William Miller but there's something which happened let me read I will start with paragraph number one you go with me mark that point they read clearly read clearly it's saying that if William Miller have seen the light of the third angel's message. Many things which look dark and mysterious to him would have been explained. But his brethren professed so deep love and interest for him that he thought he could not tear away from them. His heart will incline toward the truth and then he looked as his brethren they opposed it. Was Moses also posted? You are going to understand. Could he tear away from those who had stood side by side with him in proclamation of the Jesus? He thought they they surely would not lead him astray. The last one, God suffered him to fall under the power of Satan, the dominion of death, and hid him in the grave for those who were constantly drawing him from the truth. Moses aired as he was about to enter the promised. So also I saw that William Miller aired as he was soon to enter the heavenly in suffering his influence to the against the truth. Others led him to this. Others must account for it. But angels watched the precious death of this servant and he will come forth at the sound of the last triumph. Praise God. Will we meet William in heaven? Praise God. Others will be accountable. Others will are going to be what? To be accountable. It means that there's a a serious striking similarity between the uh between the Israelites and also between the advent of the Millerite movement. I know my time is spent, but when I'm coming, I will look for the Miller associates and the menite crying. As I go to the division of the Millerite movement, we're going to in that division looking to the division in the Millerite movement. I leave the Millerite movement. I come to the sabatarian what Adventist Sabatarian Adventist. I know I'm I'm going to the birth of the remnant church and we the bath of the remnant church contain a lot of things. I know there is where to the bath and the progress of the remnant church. We want to look our birth. We want our church back. Praise God. We are crying to God that God may you give us our church back. But we we are going to look that what is that our church? What is that our church? It will get time. I know I'm going to look the found you know we are being told that the foundation of our when we want to look our foundation it is the in the great adventist movement of the year 1840 to the year 1844. Let can I should conclude at that point then let's everyone have a question I I shall pray then I give that time can we pray and God in heaven glory honor and adoration be unto thee and thy son the plan of redemption that thou have set that we might be redeemed unto the perfect image of thy son. Thank you for clearly showing us the striking illustration, the parallel of the Israelites and the Adventist movement and also of the little bit of Millerite movement. You know, if time will allow as we are continuing the lesson of the church heritage, we will clearly understand the Millerite movement and all questions. May you help us to settle in. Above all, God in heaven, help the teachers that are coming before me and let all these things be printed in our mind. For I pray in Jesus name. [Music]",
        "timestamped_transcript": "[0.2s] We are going to determine why and we\n[2.2s] going to ask ourselves will be in heaven\n[4.6s] and if he be in heaven it will be happy.\n[6.5s] We are going to deterine will be in\n[8.5s] heaven. We being told about William\n[10.3s] Miller. As a little boy, William Miller\n[12.7s] lived on a farm in eastern New York. And\n[15.8s] on and let me read\n[20.1s] 16.3\n[22.3s] 16\n[23.9s] AP BP AP\n[29.6s] BP AP BP. Sir, you are also going to\n[34.0s] write that William was a Baptist. He was\n[37.4s] in Baptist church. He was a Baptist. And\n[40.6s] I want to read to you because William\n[42.6s] Miller, we're being told that at one\n[44.6s] time when God is using William Miller,\n[47.0s] there reach a time that William Miller\n[48.8s] discarded or William Miller at one point\n[51.8s] neglected or doubted the principle of\n[54.1s] the B of the Bible whom God\n[57.9s] used to establish the foundation of our\n[60.8s] faith. There was at one time he doubted\n[64.3s] the principles of God or the Bible of\n[66.6s] God, the Bible of God. And when we will\n[69.1s] look at it parallel to the Israelites to\n[72.9s] the uh the parallel of the or Israelites\n[75.8s] movement, we are going to determine some\n[77.9s] of the sweet things. And we being told\n[79.8s] that when William Miller when he was a\n[82.2s] youth, he he came in contact with those\n[85.4s] who neglected the oracles of God. The\n[89.2s] day east\n[91.5s] Let me read. William Miller had a strong\n[94.8s] religious background but he become\n[97.5s] attached to the wrong crowd. His friends\n[101.0s] were ded. The these people set aside the\n[104.9s] Bible and had valued idea about God and\n[108.8s] his personality.\n[111.1s] It means\n[115.0s] that that they discarded what the Bible\n[118.6s] God and also the personality of God the\n[121.4s] personality of God and when William\n[123.7s] Miller get in contact with them. William\n[126.2s] Miller also take their beliefs and\n[129.6s] William Miller also neglected or he did\n[132.5s] not what he he did not believe the\n[135.8s] oracles of God. The oracles of God. Let\n[138.4s] me proceed. But Miller was always a man\n[141.8s] of high moral character. What he failed\n[144.5s] to find in relig religion he sought to\n[147.5s] find in high and patriot patriotic\n[151.0s] attainment. He served his country as an\n[153.9s] officer in the war in\n[156.4s] 1812. So William Miller was an army\n[159.1s] officer and the year 1812 he served as\n[162.5s] an army officer. I know you should write\n[164.2s] those things in 18 of as an early\n[167.8s] officer and also he was also a con\n[174.9s] constable\n[176.6s] sim. Yes. And also he was a justice of\n[180.4s] peace. He was he was doing three roles\n[184.2s] in that\n[186.0s] community in the year 1812.\n[189.3s] before that in the year 1812 you're\n[192.1s] finding that he did not believe the\n[193.4s] oracles of God and he was serving as an\n[196.2s] army officer and also when you are\n[197.9s] writing you also write that the father\n[199.8s] of William Miller was also an army\n[202.2s] officer and William Miller also serve as\n[204.8s] an army officer is served with\n[207.8s] distinction later in home community\n[210.8s] served as a justice of\n[214.1s] peace and his associations with his\n[217.0s] brethren but there A time after the war\n[220.5s] in the year\n[221.8s] 1812 when brother Miller when that war\n[225.1s] was finished the mother of Miller was\n[228.2s] widowed and the father of Miller was the\n[231.3s] father of milad died finding that Miller\n[234.8s] take his time Miller is going back home\n[237.8s] that he may stay and be a farmer and\n[241.1s] after we are finding that Miller being a\n[242.9s] farmer because of his mother because he\n[245.6s] loved his mother so much he tried to\n[247.8s] take time and go to what? To the Baptist\n[250.8s] church. And when you get to the Baptist\n[253.4s] church where his uncle was a\n[256.4s] preacher, there was no preacher. There\n[259.3s] were sometimes even the deacons were\n[261.5s] given printed sermon to preach. There\n[264.2s] were children given printed sermons to\n[266.6s] preach. But William Miller is not like\n[269.1s] that. But his\n[272.4s] motions, he he really\n[275.5s] liked the oracles of God.\n[278.6s] But after going to the Baptist church\n[281.1s] because of the emotions all because of\n[284.1s] being drawn by his mother who was\n[285.7s] widowed when he got back home he there\n[289.2s] was no preacher in that church. Then\n[292.0s] there was one Sunday which William\n[293.9s] Miller was given a sermon printed sermon\n[296.7s] to go and do what? print and sermon to\n[299.0s] go and uh to go and present and after\n[301.5s] being given print and sermon William\n[305.0s] started to believe the Bible and to ask\n[307.4s] the qu the question of the Bible. Let me\n[309.9s] uh proceed by\n[313.5s] reading when William was 34 years of age\n[316.6s] he become dissatisfied with his views.\n[318.9s] The Holy Spirit impressed in heart and\n[321.6s] it turned to the study of the word of\n[323.3s] God. In\n[325.8s] this in this book, Jesus was revealed to\n[329.2s] him as his savior. He found in Christ\n[332.2s] the answer to all his needs. He\n[335.0s] determined to study the Bible carefully\n[337.6s] and to determine if he could the answer\n[340.6s] to many problem that he had perplexed\n[343.0s] him. His\n[345.5s] studies led him to great prophecies that\n[349.1s] pointed to the first and to the second\n[351.8s] advent of our law of our Lord. When\n[355.0s] William Miller was studying the\n[356.2s] prophecy, he go to the study of the\n[357.8s] Bible. You're right. In the year\n[360.4s] 1816, William Miller started studying\n[363.0s] the oracles of God. In the year 1816, he\n[366.9s] ventured now to study and to know what\n[369.6s] is contained in the word of God, the\n[371.7s] word of God. And he was studying step by\n[374.6s] step. When Miller Miller started with\n[376.8s] Genesis 1 verse one, he cannot go to\n[380.0s] Genesis 1 verse number two. Without\n[383.5s] understanding Genesis chapter 1 verse\n[385.3s] number one,\n[389.4s] one without\n[391.3s] understanding it's saying the time\n[393.7s] prophesied interested him particularly\n[395.8s] the prophecies of Daniel and\n[399.5s] Revelation. He studied and what did\n[402.3s] William Miller use when studying the\n[404.4s] Bible? There were William Miller rules\n[408.1s] in studying the B the Bible. He had\n[410.3s] rules and there's a book written by\n[412.0s] William Miller on rules of interpreting\n[414.2s] the Bible in the blue estate. If you\n[416.5s] find time get time to study the rules\n[419.6s] but he was using something called\n[424.1s] conudin or conco concordance. Do we know\n[427.1s] the concordance?\n[433.4s] explain that was the Bible. What was\n[435.6s] Miller using or the\n[438.4s] crudence or\n[440.8s] concordance and very interesting that\n[444.2s] when William Miller was studying Daniel\n[446.0s] and Revelation, he read them. But while\n[449.8s] getting to the book of Daniel 8 verse\n[451.8s] number\n[452.8s] 14, the foundation of the Adventist\n[455.4s] movement is being established.\n[457.8s] In the only Daniel 8 verse number 14 is\n[460.6s] what has made a seventh day advent. Let\n[463.1s] us read Daniel 8 verse number\n[468.2s] 14. Daniel 8 verse number\n[471.7s] 14. The Bible\n[474.7s] says and he said unto\n[477.4s] him unto\n[480.5s] 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be\n[484.3s] cleansed. When William Miller reached in\n[487.0s] Daniel 8 verse number\n[489.2s] 14, God has been sending his his angels\n[492.6s] to guide to instructing in the oracles\n[495.6s] of God. But when he reached the year 18,\n[498.6s] he reached what? Daniel 8:14, William\n[501.4s] read that unto\n[503.0s] 2,300 days shall the sanctuary\n[508.0s] be then interpreted that the sanctuary\n[510.7s] is the church and that church is in this\n[514.2s] earth. So it means that after\n[517.3s] 2,300 days this earth will be clear\n[521.0s] cleansed. It means that when this earth\n[523.7s] is going to be cleansed, it is going to\n[525.8s] be cleansed with fire. And when he was\n[528.9s] also reading the Bible, he is finding\n[531.0s] that that is the it means that the\n[533.0s] second advent of of Christ, it means\n[537.0s] then William Miller\n[539.1s] interpreted that what will be the end of\n[541.9s] this 2,300\n[544.8s] days? What was the the end of this\n[548.0s] 2,300\n[550.9s] days? Then he tried to interpret. I want\n[553.5s] you to write the first interpretation of\n[555.4s] Miller.\n[557.0s] The first interpretation of\n[559.3s] me. The first interpretation of me. Let\n[562.2s] me go to 16 number five as I tell you\n[565.4s] something. It say uh the book that I was\n[567.8s] reading it say that in the year 1818. So\n[571.6s] you're right. He started reading the\n[574.3s] Bible\n[575.6s] 1816 and the year\n[578.2s] 1818 he reached the conclusion that\n[582.8s] after after how many\n[586.7s] days? 18:18 that Christ will be coming\n[590.3s] how many days before him? 25 day 25\n[594.2s] years within 25 years Christ will be\n[597.6s] coming. You write that 1818 read that\n[601.4s] after 25 years Christ will be coming.\n[606.1s] He come to the conclusion that Christ\n[608.2s] will come sometimes in the year 1843 or\n[612.7s] 1844. And you read that between you\n[616.1s] write March 25, 1843 to March 21st\n[622.1s] 1844 Christ will be coming between those\n[624.9s] days between those days between those\n[627.4s] months that Christ will be coming. That\n[630.0s] was the first interpretation of me not\n[634.1s] 1844 not October 1844. No the is first\n[638.4s] interpretation was that from March\n[641.1s] 1821st to\n[643.6s] March March 21st\n[646.4s] 1844 Christ will be\n[650.0s] coming. Christ will be coming. That was\n[653.4s] his first interpretation.\n[657.4s] And uh me I think that if I was in the\n[660.6s] time of William I could have believed. I\n[663.6s] want to I want to establish for you why\n[667.0s] because William studied thoroughly the\n[669.5s] Bible. There were signs of time that\n[671.6s] way. I've taken time that we may read we\n[674.0s] may sing Psalm\n[675.6s] 212 and I will read it once more and try\n[679.2s] to to tell you what was it evidence and\n[682.5s] try to ask you that if it was you could\n[684.8s] you not believe\n[687.0s] then let me let me proceed then that in\n[691.0s] the year 18 in the year\n[693.3s] 1818 that it was the conclusion of of\n[696.3s] William Miller that in 25 years Christ\n[698.2s] will appear. Can you put for me great\n[699.9s] controversy page\n[702.8s] 329.2\n[705.0s] 329.2 that we may read together as we\n[708.2s] proceed. GC\n[712.9s] 329.2\n[715.6s] GC329.2 I'm only reading the first word\n[718.6s] she's\n[719.4s] saying you see 329.2 two, he had devoted\n[723.3s] two years to the study of the Bible when\n[726.6s] in\n[727.9s] 1818 he reached the solemn conviction\n[731.4s] that in about 24 years Christ will\n[735.0s] appear for the redemption of his people.\n[738.6s] Are we okay? That in about 24 years\n[742.2s] Christ will be appear for redemption of\n[744.0s] his what? Of his people. Are we see CCP\n[747.5s] we are preaching that Christ will\n[748.8s] appear? It is soon to appear also. This\n[751.9s] the message that we are preaching is the\n[754.1s] message that William Miller\n[756.9s] preached. William Miller preached. But\n[760.7s] when William Miller the conclusion in\n[762.6s] the year 1818, he started sharing it to\n[765.8s] his friend that Christ will appear 25\n[768.9s] years later. But he had not he did not\n[771.8s] publicly pronounce he did not publicly\n[774.7s] go and start preaching that Christ is\n[777.7s] coming. But he said that what if I'm in\n[781.7s] error? What if I'm in error? What if I\n[784.6s] mislead souls? That was the question\n[787.9s] which was disturbing William and he\n[790.5s] start discussing it with friends. But in\n[793.8s] the year 1831 is the first time that\n[797.0s] William Miller go publicly to\n[800.4s] what to proclaim that Christ is coming.\n[803.7s] Right. In the year 1831, in the year\n[807.5s] 1831, in the year 1831, then William in\n[811.4s] the first time publicly give the reason\n[813.4s] of his faith. How many years from year\n[816.4s] 1816 to the year 1831? How many years\n[819.8s] did he devoted in studying the\n[821.8s] scriptures before publicly pronouncing?\n[826.1s] It is 15 years.\n[830.2s] Maybe maybe someone is taking one month\n[833.4s] and another could really that Christ is\n[836.2s] coming. But William Miller devoted 15\n[838.3s] years before publicly proclaiming and\n[841.8s] the William Miller heart was being\n[844.3s] disturbed. God was talking to William\n[846.4s] Miller that go and proclaim to my people\n[849.9s] the message that I have given you.\n[853.0s] William Miller was not in heresy but God\n[856.3s] sent his angel to guide William Miller.\n[859.1s] He was not in what?\n[861.2s] Heresy. He was not in heresy. And we're\n[865.0s] being told that after William Miller,\n[867.0s] there was a time that when he was\n[869.0s] talking to God, he's saying that God,\n[871.4s] when I will be called, when I will be\n[874.2s] called to preach this truth, I will do,\n[877.1s] I will go. And on that on that time, on\n[879.8s] that day, there was a Baptist preacher\n[882.5s] who came and invited him to preach a\n[885.0s] sermon. And that was the first time in\n[887.2s] the year 1831 that you do what? You take\n[890.5s] time to establish the reason of his\n[892.2s] faith. And also that is in the great\n[894.0s] controversy page 330 paragraph number\n[896.5s] two. You\n[897.6s] write great controversy page 330. The\n[901.3s] paragraph is paragraph number two. And I\n[904.6s] will read as it ends as it ends. I'm not\n[907.9s] going for uh 1831. Are you seeing for 9\n[912.2s] years?\n[913.9s] Let me start with let me start the\n[916.9s] words. The words you\n[919.8s] can the words were\n[922.3s] ever recurring to his mind. These were\n[925.5s] the words which angels were telling the\n[927.1s] William go and tell it to the world.\n[932.2s] Their blood will I require at thy who\n[935.7s] guided\n[938.1s] William? It means that God guided that\n[941.4s] he was he was coming in the year 18 but\n[944.3s] he forced\n[947.4s] through the ministation of the holy\n[948.8s] angels we will read the in the writings\n[951.3s] I know we are coming it's saying for 9\n[954.0s] years he waited the burden still\n[956.9s] pressing upon his soul until in 1831 he\n[961.1s] for the first time publicly gave the\n[964.0s] reason of his\n[966.2s] way publicly gave the reason of is what\n[969.2s] is faith that is in the year\n[971.2s] 1831 and from that\n[973.9s] time was being called from every hand\n[977.0s] from every every hand and he was alone\n[980.8s] we going to determine that it is until\n[984.1s] 18 1838 that we find another associate\n[988.0s] of William but for all those what 1831\n[991.0s] to\n[991.9s] 183 1839 how many years 8 years he was\n[996.5s] only preaching alone we are going to\n[998.6s] find the associates of William Miller.\n[1000.5s] But that was in the year 1831 he first\n[1004.2s] publicly given the reason of his faith\n[1006.9s] and also right in the year\n[1008.8s] 1843. In the year\n[1012.7s] 1843 in the year\n[1015.6s] 1843 that is great controversy. You can\n[1018.1s] move to great controversy 332.1.\n[1023.8s] 332.1 it says that in\n[1027.3s] 1833 Miller received a license to preach\n[1031.0s] from the Baptist church of which he was\n[1034.4s] a member. So we are writing the year\n[1037.2s] 1833 William received a license as a\n[1040.9s] minister of the Baptist church to preach\n[1044.2s] after him giving the evidence of his\n[1046.0s] faith that truly Christ is coming 25\n[1049.7s] years before me. Christ is coming. He\n[1052.8s] received a license. A large number of\n[1055.2s] ministers of Islam denomination also\n[1058.6s] approved his work and he it was with\n[1061.6s] their formal sanction that he continue\n[1063.8s] his labor. He received what alliances. I\n[1066.8s] know I will try when we are looking for\n[1069.0s] the birth and the progress of the\n[1071.3s] remnant church. We will look about the\n[1073.3s] ordination and the credentials also in\n[1075.5s] the seventh adventist church because we\n[1077.6s] are having ordination and credential\n[1080.1s] Sabbath before us. And I would like that\n[1082.7s] before we reach on that Sabbath where we\n[1084.8s] will have ordination and credential, we\n[1086.9s] will try to look the birth and the\n[1089.1s] progress of seventh adventist about\n[1091.6s] ordination, about credentials and about\n[1094.7s] who to be ordained, who to baptize, why\n[1097.6s] baptism, if I will only find time. But\n[1100.2s] William Miller was given license in the\n[1102.1s] year 1833 by the Baptist church,\n[1105.0s] recognized by ministers and members of\n[1107.6s] what? Members of his church. And I know\n[1111.7s] we have been reading it is Christ in his\n[1114.4s] sanctuary\n[1118.6s] 87.1. This is the foundation of faith. C\n[1122.1s] I H SS\n[1129.8s] 87.1 C IH\n[1133.1s] SS87 number one he said the the\n[1136.5s] scripture above all\n[1139.9s] other the scriptures which above all\n[1142.5s] other had been both the foundation and\n[1145.2s] the central pillar of the Adventist\n[1147.5s] faith. So what is our foundation? Our\n[1150.2s] central pillar. You know I can talk of\n[1152.4s] the Adventist movement but when I do not\n[1155.5s] look the foundation when I do not pass\n[1158.2s] to William Miller and the winnerite\n[1160.1s] movement I have not talk of the\n[1162.1s] Adventist movement. And I want you to\n[1164.0s] have a clear understanding. It say that\n[1166.1s] the scripture above all other had been\n[1169.0s] both the foundation and the central pill\n[1171.1s] of the Adventist way. What the is\n[1173.1s] correlation and to 2,300 days since then\n[1177.9s] shall the sanctuary be cleansed. That is\n[1180.3s] our foundation. That is our central\n[1182.6s] pill. It means that when you want to\n[1184.8s] finish the seven adventist church, don't\n[1187.0s] go to the personality of\n[1188.8s] God. Don't go don't go to the Sabbath,\n[1192.9s] but come unto our central pill. You only\n[1196.8s] remove what? You only remove the\n[1198.3s] sanctuary and the adventist movement is\n[1201.4s] finished. And when you come also with\n[1204.8s] 2520 that is sanctuary you have removed\n[1207.5s] what? You have removed seventh\n[1209.8s] adventist. Why am I saying\n[1213.0s] so? That was unto the declaration of\n[1215.8s] 2,300 days of the sanctuary be cleansed.\n[1218.4s] That is our central pillar of the\n[1221.4s] Adventist movement. When you do not\n[1223.6s] understand that, read with me. Ali\n[1225.6s] writing 63. Ali writing\n[1229.6s] 63.2. 63.2. I want you to post it in\n[1233.0s] screen quickly. Ali writing 63.\n[1238.8s] 63.2. I want you to read with me. Ali\n[1241.4s] writing 63. Paragraph is paragraph\n[1244.4s] number two. And\n[1248.3s] readly read. It say, can you read with\n[1251.8s] me? Uh, but such subjects of the\n[1255.6s] sanctuary in connection with 2300 days,\n[1260.2s] the commandment of God and the per and\n[1263.2s] the faith of Jesus are perfectly\n[1265.5s] calculated to explain the past Adventist\n[1269.1s] movement and show what our present\n[1271.7s] position is. When we want to look the\n[1274.9s] past Adventist movement and our history,\n[1277.8s] we go to the sanctuary and 2300 days as\n[1282.1s] we are connecting with three angels\n[1283.8s] message about the commandment of God and\n[1286.4s] the faith of Jesus. That is our\n[1290.3s] foundation. That is our foundation. And\n[1293.2s] when William Miller was doing what was\n[1296.4s] establishing his faith, there was a book\n[1299.4s] written by William being written science\n[1302.3s] of times. When it was written science of\n[1305.0s] time of January 1843, William Miller\n[1308.3s] read\n[1309.6s] this said this word. He said I want to\n[1313.3s] quote you for the words of William\n[1314.9s] Miller, not mine. is saying that I am\n[1317.4s] fully\n[1319.9s] convinced that I am fully\n[1323.2s] convinced I don't know I let me project\n[1326.2s] for you it is being written a prophet\n[1328.2s] among you a p a y a prophet among you\n[1333.1s] know I will take much of the time also\n[1334.6s] reading prophet a prophet among you it's\n[1336.3s] a serious book if you go to blue estate\n[1339.3s] you will see you write a p a y a prophet\n[1342.6s] among you 193 paragraph number\n[1345.8s] Can you hear these words of William\n[1347.1s] Miller? When William Miller stand to\n[1348.5s] preach, no man can gain\n[1350.7s] say with the oracles and I want to\n[1353.2s] establish the sermon of William Miller.\n[1356.2s] AP AY\n[1358.4s] 193.1 Can you put we read together with\n[1361.3s] my friends? It is not there. Let me read\n[1363.9s] as you searching in the other world.\n[1366.9s] AP AE read in signs of times of January\n[1370.6s] 25, 1843, William Miller declared, I am\n[1374.6s] fully convinced that sometime between\n[1378.0s] March 21st, 1843 and March 25, 1844,\n[1383.1s] according to the Jewish mode of\n[1386.5s] computation of time, Christ will come.\n[1390.6s] The months of 1843 and 1844 rolled by\n[1394.5s] with increased expectancy on the part of\n[1397.6s] the believers in the advent. The\n[1400.2s] proceeding were watched by many\n[1402.2s] unbelieving of sabans and kept skeptism\n[1405.4s] prejudice or moary grieve. William\n[1408.6s] Miller is writing that in January 25\n[1411.1s] that I'm fully convinced that March 21st\n[1414.8s] 1843 to March 21st 1844 Christ will\n[1418.9s] appear. But there were a lot of\n[1421.4s] prejudices. There were lot of\n[1423.7s] skepticism. But the sad thing that the\n[1427.0s] years the mans keep scrolling that when\n[1430.6s] they were looking in\n[1432.6s] 1843 1844 21st they are not seeing\n[1436.7s] Christ\n[1438.3s] coming but there was something there was\n[1441.0s] a point which William\n[1444.1s] me because let me read may you mark this\n[1448.1s] my word he's saying the majority however\n[1451.4s] although discouraged and\n[1453.3s] disappointed I'm reading my quote which\n[1455.4s] I I put it say the majority however\n[1458.2s] although discourage and disappointment\n[1460.6s] still believed that the advent was to be\n[1463.4s] expected at any moment praise God that\n[1466.9s] in the first word the first\n[1468.3s] interpretation of me the first\n[1470.4s] interpretation of me we are being told\n[1472.5s] that people were not being discouraged\n[1474.6s] by the great\n[1475.6s] disappointment but they believe that in\n[1479.0s] a moment later Christ is going to appear\n[1483.2s] it's say that manfully Miller admitted\n[1487.0s] that he had been in error but he also\n[1490.2s] called the believer's attention to Abak\n[1493.3s] 2:3 let us read when 1840\n[1497.6s] uh vers 25 1844 passed William came and\n[1502.7s] read in the book of Abak 2:3 that indeed\n[1507.4s] I am correct when I'm looking for the\n[1509.2s] signs of times I'm seeing that Christ is\n[1511.9s] going to appear\n[1513.4s] When I'm reading the sun, I'm reading\n[1515.1s] the stars. Christ is really going to do\n[1517.0s] what? To appear. But 25 1844 is passing.\n[1521.4s] They are not seeing any moment that\n[1522.9s] Christ is doing what? Christ is coming.\n[1525.4s] Then he's going to use scripture and\n[1527.4s] will a man of scriptures, a man of\n[1529.8s] evidences come to the book of Habac 2:3\n[1533.1s] and try also to start encouraging his\n[1535.4s] people that the vision is for the time\n[1537.9s] appointed. Yet the vision may yet Christ\n[1541.2s] is going to but it is for appointed\n[1544.2s] time. Let you read with me saying for\n[1547.6s] the vision is yet for an time appointed\n[1550.1s] uh for appointed time but at the end of\n[1553.5s] it shall pick and not lie though it t\n[1558.2s] wait for it because it will surely come\n[1561.8s] it will not t that you know from March\n[1566.3s] 21st to 1844 they were entering\n[1568.8s] something called the taring the ting\n[1571.0s] time have you ever read about the taring\n[1573.1s] time and also So because I I will get to\n[1577.9s] to I will get time to speak about the\n[1580.2s] the midnight cry and also when we are\n[1582.9s] looking about the Matthew 25 verse\n[1584.6s] number one as we going down about the 10\n[1586.8s] virgins there was also a ting\n[1590.0s] time about the ting time the also the\n[1594.2s] adventist movement they enter what is\n[1596.3s] called the ting\n[1598.4s] time they are being told that the vision\n[1601.0s] is for appointed time yet it may be\n[1603.5s] delayed But it will come. It will come.\n[1606.6s] They enter the tearing time. And in that\n[1608.8s] turning time, in that period is what we\n[1611.2s] are also finding the midnight cry. I\n[1612.8s] know I'm going to read when I get time,\n[1615.1s] I will read about the midnight cryog\n[1618.3s] that I may bring it to your mind. Then\n[1620.1s] it continued by saying the vision though\n[1623.3s] it\n[1624.2s] t because it will surely come soon. The\n[1627.7s] adventist papers were filled with\n[1629.6s] reference to the ting time that from the\n[1632.2s] year 184 March 25 every papers was being\n[1635.8s] written a topic called the ting time. It\n[1639.0s] continued by saying speak of Christ\n[1641.2s] parable of the 10 virgin. Millerite\n[1643.7s] lecture suddenly discovered that BC to\n[1647.8s] AD system of\n[1650.0s] chronology allowed no zero\n[1655.5s] year that when William Miller was trying\n[1658.5s] to write because I don't want to teach\n[1661.3s] on the 2300 days because time is limited\n[1665.0s] but we are finding that it started from\n[1667.7s] 457 BC then he was prolonging that line\n[1672.8s] to the year 1843 he calculated by 2300\n[1676.7s] days but he made a mistake of writing\n[1679.4s] zero year that was the\n[1684.1s] mistake but he come to that indeed\n[1687.6s] there's no zero here when you come\n[1691.6s] to 1 BC you go to 1 A but\n[1698.2s] one\n[1699.9s] what 1 BC C one\n[1705.6s] Z\n[1708.2s] BC but there was not that time then when\n[1712.2s] you\n[1713.5s] calculate\n[1715.3s] 457 2300 days\n[1718.8s] in 1840 1843 but I come to\n[1726.0s] realing time that Christ is coming in\n[1729.0s] the year\n[1730.3s] 18 18 what 44 you only had one year then\n[1735.0s] you read now the conclusion the present\n[1737.4s] standing of me now was indeed when I'm\n[1740.4s] looking for the signs of time in the\n[1742.6s] year 1844 we are going to seeing the son\n[1744.8s] of man coming the son of man\n[1748.4s] coming but I want to bring into your\n[1751.7s] mind that William Miller was I I don't\n[1756.0s] he was correctly interpreting that\n[1757.9s] crisis was\n[1759.4s] Come here. Let me read for you. I will.\n[1763.7s] Can you write a subtopic? The sixth\n[1765.5s] seal. What the interpretation of I tried\n[1768.6s] to determine to you what William Miller\n[1771.1s] established his teaching because not let\n[1775.4s] me let us go Revelation 6. When William\n[1779.8s] Miller read the book of Revelation, this\n[1781.5s] was what he read. William uh Revelation\n[1785.7s] 6 verse number 12. And I'm not going to\n[1789.1s] read uh I want you now to be keen\n[1791.6s] writer. I'm going to read some of the\n[1793.8s] scriptures and spirit of prophecy. You\n[1795.9s] might not, you may not. Then you are\n[1798.3s] going to read at your own your own time.\n[1800.5s] But can you see if this is our\n[1803.4s] interpretation how William interpreted\n[1806.0s] the Bible? He's saying this is a six\n[1808.4s] seal and I beheld. You can put it here\n[1811.6s] to\n[1815.1s] Oh. So read your Bible. Go with me in\n[1817.4s] Revelation\n[1823.0s] 6:12. Let me tell you that the six we\n[1826.2s] have how many\n[1827.3s] seals? Seven seal. But what what is of\n[1830.0s] the seventh seal? The\n[1832.0s] seven. You know\n[1834.6s] it the journey to\n[1837.6s] heaven. It is being talked about journey\n[1839.7s] to heaven. It means that indeed now we\n[1842.6s] are on the sixth seal. And also when we\n[1846.4s] want to understand that Christ is\n[1847.8s] coming, we go to the sixth because after\n[1849.9s] the sixth in Aisha to Eevee, we are\n[1852.9s] going to the journey to heaven. And it\n[1855.8s] say Revelation 6:12. And I beheld when\n[1860.2s] he had opened the sixth seal, and lo,\n[1863.2s] there was\n[1864.7s] great, right? The interpretation of\n[1868.2s] first, there was\n[1870.0s] great, and the sun\n[1872.8s] became black as soft clothes of, and the\n[1876.7s] moon became as blood. Mhm. And the stars\n[1881.4s] of heaven fell unto them even as the fig\n[1884.7s] tree\n[1886.0s] cast her anti untimely figs when she is\n[1890.1s] taken of the mighty wind. So that is the\n[1892.9s] sixth scene. The sixth is continue by\n[1895.3s] saying and the heaven departed as scroll\n[1897.8s] that is the coming of Christ when it is\n[1900.2s] rolled together and every mountain and\n[1902.7s] Islams were moved on uh of their places\n[1906.8s] and the kings of the earth and the great\n[1909.5s] men and the rich men of the chief of\n[1911.8s] captain and the mighty men everyone\n[1914.4s] bondage and everyone free hide\n[1916.6s] themselves to the rocks. That is the\n[1919.0s] coming of who? The coming of Christ. It\n[1921.5s] mean that William is reaching the\n[1923.0s] conclusion that the signs of time which\n[1925.4s] I'm going to use is Christ is coming and\n[1928.2s] when Christ is coming we have not been\n[1930.3s] given definite time but Christ was\n[1932.5s] telling his disciple about the signs of\n[1935.3s] times that after this signs of times\n[1938.8s] Christ is coming here in the Christ is\n[1941.0s] coming in revelation 6:14 s\n[1945.4s] Christ is coming in revelation 6:14 and\n[1948.8s] only revelation 6:12 and\n[1951.4s] 13 you are being told about the signs of\n[1953.7s] times that's why the Millerite song of\n[1957.8s] 212 let me read something for you\n[1960.9s] Millerite movement song 612 he's saying\n[1966.0s] that it is almost time for the Lord to\n[1968.6s] come\n[1970.4s] 212 it is almost time for the Lord to\n[1973.0s] come I hear the people say the stars of\n[1975.8s] heaven are growing dim it must be the\n[1977.8s] breaking of the day the signs for In the\n[1981.0s] sun and moon, in the earth and sea and\n[1985.8s] sky, a loud proclaimed to all mankind\n[1988.2s] the coming of the master draweth. It\n[1990.9s] means that that is their song that\n[1993.0s] Christ is coming. When we look for the\n[1995.0s] signs in the sky, in the moon, in the\n[1998.3s] stars, Christ is coming. We are finding\n[2000.6s] some things the interpretation of Mamela\n[2002.6s] in the signs of times. Do they happen\n[2004.7s] before\n[2006.4s] 1844? Can you read first? We are finding\n[2008.9s] about first sign which happen is about\n[2011.7s] the earthquake that fact the first time\n[2014.2s] which means that Christ is coming is\n[2016.6s] there will be a\n[2018.0s] great earthquake did it happened so you\n[2021.4s] write first the great earthquake the\n[2023.8s] great earthquake first the great\n[2026.3s] earthquake you read we read great\n[2028.5s] controversy\n[2029.8s] 304.2 GC\n[2033.1s] 304.2 GC 304.2 2 you see the\n[2037.5s] interpretation of me what happened GC\n[2040.9s] 304.2\n[2042.8s] We want to see when was correct in his\n[2046.4s] interpretation. Three or four paragraph\n[2049.3s] is paragraph number two. He's saying\n[2053.2s] this these signs of times these signs\n[2057.3s] were witnessed before the opening of the\n[2059.2s] 9th century. In the fulfillment of this\n[2062.6s] prophecy, they occurred in the year\n[2065.2s] 1755.\n[2067.2s] The most terrible earthquake that has\n[2069.8s] ever been recorded. Praise God. So\n[2073.6s] before 1844 in the year 1755 there was a\n[2077.4s] great earthquake which is being named\n[2079.0s] the Lisbon earthquake. Are we okay? That\n[2083.4s] is the first signs of times that William\n[2085.3s] Miller was doing what William was using.\n[2087.8s] So you write though commonly known as\n[2090.0s] the earthquake of Lisbon it extended in\n[2092.9s] the part of Europe Africa and America it\n[2097.6s] was felt in Greenland in the west in\n[2101.6s] Indies in the east island of there are\n[2106.4s] many country and it was felt it was\n[2108.8s] worldwide it means that the first signs\n[2111.0s] of time that\n[2112.5s] will in the book revelation 6 verse 12\n[2116.6s] that there will be great earthquake. So\n[2118.4s] you write in the year 1755 the first\n[2121.5s] signs of times is the Lisbon Lisbon\n[2124.3s] earthquake recorded in great controversy\n[2128.2s] 304 it say in revelation 6:12 and I\n[2132.3s] beheld when he had opened the sixth seal\n[2135.4s] there was a great earthquake and the sun\n[2138.1s] became the sun became black as the s\n[2141.8s] close of air that is sign number\n[2147.9s] These were the interpretation of Miller\n[2150.3s] that the sun became blackened as what?\n[2154.4s] The sun. When did the sun became\n[2156.8s] blackened?\n[2162.0s] Huh? You give me evidence. I want\n[2164.6s] evidence. Not when did the sun became\n[2168.9s] blackened? Read with me. Great\n[2170.8s] controversy. I want you to write the\n[2176.6s] 306\n[2178.8s] 306.1 the blackening of the sun or the\n[2181.6s] dark the dark day and moon and moon\n[2187.6s] May you write May 17th May 19th\n[2191.8s] 178 I want you to go to the last part of\n[2194.6s] it 306.1 is\n[2204.4s] 6.1 you write on May 19, 1780. That is\n[2208.5s] the second time, the second sign which\n[2210.6s] is being which we are being told that\n[2213.0s] when you shall see the earthquake when\n[2216.3s] you shall see a great earthquake not\n[2218.8s] only earthquake but a great earthquake\n[2220.4s] of Lisbon which happened. William will\n[2222.7s] say that Christ is coming. When you\n[2224.8s] shall see\n[2226.2s] what the the dark day and when the moon\n[2229.6s] will become as blah as blood Christ is\n[2232.2s] doing what was William Miller wrong\n[2234.6s] because this thing happened you it says\n[2237.4s] that on 19th of May 1780 this prophecy\n[2241.1s] was fulf\n[2242.2s] Okay. 19th May 17 18. But there's\n[2247.0s] something which is remarkable which I do\n[2249.0s] not want to copy it. Let us go to\n[2252.4s] Matthew. It is Matthew\n[2254.4s] 24:39. Matthew 24:39. You I want you to\n[2257.8s] not a point in connection with 12\n[2261.0s] because when we are reading of what?\n[2263.0s] When we are reading of 2300 days, we are\n[2265.7s] finding that also 12 of 60 days is in\n[2268.7s] 2300 day days. It means that for William\n[2272.1s] Miller to\n[2273.6s] understand 2300 days it means also he\n[2276.5s] fully understand what 1260 days then\n[2280.5s] Matthew which is tens of times when we\n[2283.0s] read also when we are\n[2284.8s] reading what gospel workers page 148.2\n[2288.3s] True. It means that what should be\n[2290.0s] brought in the mind of people is the\n[2292.3s] book of revelation Daniel and Matthew\n[2296.9s] 24.\n[2298.5s] Matthew 24. It mean that also used\n[2302.2s] Matthew chapter 24. But there's\n[2304.1s] something so interesting. Matthew\n[2308.2s] 24:29. Read with me keenly in that\n[2312.3s] immediately after the tribulation of\n[2315.4s] those\n[2316.3s] days shall the sun be blackened darkened\n[2321.0s] and the moon shall not give her and the\n[2325.2s] star shall fall\n[2327.1s] from and the powers of the heaven shall\n[2330.3s] be and then shall appear the signs of\n[2333.3s] the son of man in heaven. It means that\n[2335.7s] after Matthew 24:29 Christ is\n[2339.2s] appearing. So you what it say that after\n[2343.1s] tribulation s and this tribulation it is\n[2346.6s] 12 60 days Christ is going to happen.\n[2349.7s] What is going to appear? Not a\n[2355.1s] Christ the dark\n[2357.1s] day. The dark day is India. It means\n[2360.1s] that it means that the\n[2361.8s] persecution could before what? Before\n[2367.3s] 1780 because 1260 days in that the\n[2371.6s] persecution\n[2373.2s] 1798 but the powers of\n[2376.2s] persecution is before what? before\n[2379.7s] before 7 before 1780 because Bible is\n[2383.1s] not wrong because Christ is saying that\n[2386.2s] unless those days be\n[2389.2s] shortened no man shall be saved. It\n[2392.7s] means that I want you also to write this\n[2394.4s] that in the year\n[2396.7s] 1776 the year\n[2399.2s] 1776 this is SSP the story of the seat\n[2404.8s] patos 120 paragraph number\n[2408.7s] one 120 paragraph number one 120\n[2412.5s] paragraph number I want to read between\n[2414.1s] the lines not to take much of the\n[2417.9s] time see 120.1 is\n[2422.2s] But God in mercy shortened the time of\n[2425.6s] persecution. For except those days shall\n[2428.3s] be shortened, no flesh shall be saved.\n[2430.2s] The persecuting powers of the papacy was\n[2432.8s] broken out in\n[2434.9s] 1776. It means that before 1798 the\n[2437.8s] persecution power was broken but when\n[2439.8s] reaching 1780 the sun the sun became\n[2443.8s] blackened. I also great controversy also\n[2447.0s] 306 number one say you're right because\n[2449.9s] my time is spent the 12 of 60 days of\n[2453.0s] the year terminated in 1798 that is the\n[2456.2s] correct interpretation a quarter of\n[2458.5s] century earlier persecution had almost\n[2461.7s] wholly ceased following this persecution\n[2464.5s] according to the words of Christ so\n[2468.4s] 1798US 2573\n[2475.3s] It means between 1773 to 1776\n[2478.4s] persecution that's why after tribulation\n[2480.8s] in 1780 we are being told that the what\n[2483.6s] is coming the day to be blah bl you will\n[2487.4s] read much but I'm only giving you the\n[2489.8s] evidences of William and also the third\n[2494.0s] interpretation about the falling of the\n[2497.1s] stars so this was his climax that when\n[2501.0s] stars in a fall to evil rises at the at\n[2505.1s] the door. You read with me great\n[2507.0s] controversy\n[2508.4s] 333.1 GC 333.1 you write the falling of\n[2512.3s] the stars in November 13th you write\n[2515.0s] November 13th\n[2517.4s] 1833 we are seeing the falling of the\n[2521.1s] stars November\n[2523.1s] 13th 184 1833 we are seeing the falling\n[2526.9s] of the stars after the falling of the\n[2529.1s] stars Christ is coming in the year 1844\n[2531.7s] was William Miller\n[2535.5s] You cannot\n[2539.4s] answer this prophecy that is revelation\n[2542.7s] 6:13 about the falling of the star. We\n[2545.6s] being told that this\n[2547.4s] prophecy it say that this prophecy\n[2551.8s] received a striking\n[2556.2s] of the greatest\n[2558.8s] metoic shower of November\n[2563.2s] 13,833. You will read as you go\n[2565.3s] downward. Meic shower that is what? The\n[2567.8s] falling of the stars that was the last\n[2570.9s] which was being used. It means that\n[2573.6s] William Miller was correct in his\n[2575.2s] interpretation that Christ is soon what\n[2577.2s] is soon coming. There's also last thing\n[2579.5s] that also when William Miller combined\n[2582.6s] with his associates which is who which\n[2585.0s] is it is Josiah le it is Josiah le uh in\n[2589.4s] the because they also interpretated in\n[2592.0s] the year\n[2593.1s] 1838 that when it will reach August 11\n[2596.9s] 1840 there will be the fall of the\n[2600.1s] Ottoman Empire that is in the book of\n[2602.9s] revelation 9 from verse number 19 to\n[2605.3s] verse number 21 and when you come from\n[2607.9s] Revelation 9 19-21 when you are going to\n[2611.0s] the revelation chapter 10 you are being\n[2613.0s] told that they had been given a voice to\n[2614.7s] go and proclaim the first and the second\n[2617.7s] angels message. So you have read about\n[2620.3s] the Ottoman Empire about the church the\n[2623.0s] fall of the Ottoman Empire when the\n[2625.7s] August 18 August 11 1840 you can write\n[2629.5s] that the fall of the Ottoman Empire was\n[2631.6s] also the interpretation which happened\n[2633.6s] in August 11th\n[2636.9s] 1840 if you get time you can read on it\n[2640.5s] on SP78.2\n[2643.0s] too. You can read the fall of the\n[2645.0s] Ottoman Empire which gave them now the\n[2647.7s] people now believed that the\n[2649.8s] interpretation are what? The\n[2651.9s] interpretation are sure. The\n[2655.2s] interpretation are sure. It means that\n[2658.2s] Miller was correct in his what? In his\n[2661.5s] interpretation. William Miller correct\n[2663.4s] in his interpretation. It means that God\n[2665.7s] had been leading his people. But when we\n[2668.8s] will go to understand we will go to that\n[2671.4s] where why did not Christ do what? Why\n[2673.8s] did not Christ do what did not Christ\n[2677.4s] come? And when we want to know our faith\n[2681.9s] when we want to know the seventh\n[2683.6s] adventist movement it is at the great\n[2686.8s] disappointment that seventh adventist\n[2689.4s] was esta established. It was through the\n[2692.8s] labor of William Miller that our faith\n[2695.8s] was\n[2697.5s] established because God has been leading\n[2699.8s] his\n[2701.4s] people. God has been leading his people.\n[2703.9s] And I know we will have a subtopic and\n[2706.3s] you can also write about about about the\n[2709.8s] Miller and Moses. There's a serious\n[2712.9s] striking similarity that as Moses\n[2716.1s] because I was really impressed by the\n[2717.8s] sermon of of brother Maxwell.\n[2720.9s] I will read those things once more. I\n[2722.6s] will read them once\n[2723.9s] more. He give me now easy time of\n[2726.8s] explaining the striking similarity of\n[2729.2s] the Adventist movement and of the\n[2731.6s] Millerite movement and of Miller. He\n[2733.8s] tried to explain to me but let me tell\n[2735.9s] you that William Miller was correct. And\n[2738.8s] when you want to know that our faith is\n[2741.2s] being established in the Millerite\n[2742.6s] movement, we are also going to look to\n[2744.5s] the as Israelites the Israelites\n[2747.8s] movement that as God led William Miller.\n[2750.8s] So God has led who Moses Moses I know as\n[2756.1s] we will be\n[2757.2s] going also the birth and the progress of\n[2759.8s] the Adventist movement as is apostasy.\n[2762.2s] What will help us so much to have the\n[2764.3s] correct interpretation is about what?\n[2767.1s] It's about the history of the Israelites\n[2768.7s] and the Adventist what movement. Can you\n[2770.6s] write that? The striking similarity of\n[2773.0s] the Israelites and the Adventist\n[2775.4s] movement. Striking similarity. I'm only\n[2779.0s] going that subtopic and introduction\n[2781.6s] then I finish because my time is spent.\n[2784.3s] My time is spent for you to give me easy\n[2786.3s] time and you go and study for yourself.\n[2789.0s] There's something which are being told\n[2790.2s] in great controversy page\n[2792.9s] 457 conclude we will know. Coming to we\n[2798.1s] going to know about the milite movement\n[2800.7s] clearly and if I find time we will talk\n[2803.3s] of the mill associates someone like\n[2806.2s] Josiah\n[2808.5s] lech snow\n[2813.6s] also Joseph\n[2818.6s] snowh who again\n[2822.2s] Charles F who again we are going to look\n[2825.3s] for Yeah. Yes. James White also was\n[2827.5s] associate of William. We will also look\n[2829.4s] for the division among the\n[2831.1s] milit. The division in the milite\n[2833.3s] movement. But read for with me great\n[2835.0s] controversy page 457. The paragraph is\n[2837.9s] paragraph number one. I think so.\n[2841.3s] 457.1. How many minutes do I have?\n[2844.9s] 15 minutes. Thank you so much.\n[2847.8s] 457 paragraph number one. As I look for\n[2851.1s] the the Millerite movement in biblical\n[2853.4s] concept. The Millerite movement in\n[2855.4s] biblical concept. 457 paragraph is\n[2858.2s] paragraph number two. Go with me.\n[2859.9s] Paragraph number\n[2861.2s] two. Paragraph number\n[2863.9s] two. Paragraph number two. He's saying I\n[2867.3s] want you to clearly understand this\n[2868.6s] quotation because it will help us in our\n[2870.8s] study. He's saying we are studying on\n[2873.0s] church heritage or the history of the\n[2875.0s] church. We're being told that the\n[2876.9s] history of the ancient Israelites is a\n[2880.2s] striking illustration of the past\n[2882.4s] experience of the Adventist\n[2885.5s] B. So it means that when you put the\n[2888.7s] history of the ancient Israel this side\n[2891.6s] and also when you put the history of the\n[2893.7s] Adventist movement this side they are\n[2895.1s] striking illustration. That's why I\n[2897.5s] don't want to go to the midnight cry\n[2899.4s] before I come to this that their history\n[2901.6s] is parallel. It continued by saying God\n[2904.4s] led his people in the adventist movement\n[2907.3s] even has he led the children of\n[2909.2s] Israelites from Egypt. It means that as\n[2913.0s] God led his children in the Adventist\n[2915.4s] movement, it is the same way he led his\n[2917.7s] children in from Egypt. In the great\n[2921.5s] disappointment, you can write one thing\n[2923.5s] here because I cannot know because we\n[2926.8s] have Egypt\n[2928.4s] Syri. We are going to look that it\n[2930.7s] resembled the midnight cry. We have the\n[2932.6s] Red Sea you can write which resembles\n[2936.9s] what the great disappointment. We also\n[2940.6s] have what? We have also the rebellion at\n[2944.0s] Kesh Bar which happened in the year\n[2947.6s] 1888. We have also the apostasy at\n[2950.8s] Jordan which is our omega of\n[2954.8s] apostasy. Are we clear? which is our\n[2958.0s] mega of apostasy. We will\n[2961.4s] determine. Let me\n[2965.3s] go. In the great disappointment, their\n[2968.3s] faith was\n[2969.6s] tested as that of the Hebrews in the Red\n[2973.5s] Sea. So there is a striking similarity\n[2976.5s] in the great disappointment which we\n[2978.2s] look and also the testing in the Red\n[2980.9s] Sea. It continued by saying that had\n[2985.3s] they still trusted to the guiding hand\n[2988.1s] that had been with them in their past\n[2989.8s] experience, they would have seen the\n[2992.9s] salvation of God. If all who had labor\n[2995.4s] unitedly in the work in 1844 had\n[2998.4s] received the third angel's message and\n[3000.6s] proclaimed to the power of the spirit,\n[3002.2s] the Lord will have wrote the mighty\n[3004.0s] works of their effort effort. It mean\n[3007.1s] that when William the third angel's\n[3010.6s] message, it mean that we could have been\n[3012.6s] in heaven now. Praise God. We could have\n[3015.8s] been in what? In heaven. It means that\n[3018.1s] when we are looking also for the\n[3019.8s] history, we also go to the history of\n[3021.8s] the of the of the Israelites and\n[3024.9s] understand clearly that this church is a\n[3027.4s] church led by God. See church. And yet\n[3030.2s] we have just come here to to put our\n[3033.8s] things that we believe this and this but\n[3035.8s] we we have dived them from the scripture\n[3038.7s] 2M\n[3040.4s] 399 399.1 number one 2M 399 number\n[3048.1s] one 3991 I want you also to understand\n[3054.7s] this so I'm not too kind I'm Sorry.\n[3061.2s] 3SM\n[3063.1s] 3SM399 number one. It\n[3067.0s] says\n[3069.2s] 3SM3991 is saying that there should be a\n[3072.3s] constant walking in\n[3074.9s] humility. There there should be no just\n[3077.8s] occasion for our Uhhuh. Let me look for\n[3080.2s] the the point which I want. The point\n[3083.4s] which I\n[3084.5s] want the point which I want.\n[3088.4s] Mhm.\n[3090.2s] the point which I\n[3094.0s] want the point which I want but I'm not\n[3096.6s] getting in here but we can get it in the\n[3098.2s] book education I highlighted it by in\n[3101.0s] the book of education 178 I will give\n[3103.7s] you that that 3SM but education 178 also\n[3107.4s] put it clearly when I'm not finding inm\n[3110.2s] let me read in the education education\n[3113.4s] 178 number three 178 number three we are\n[3116.6s] being told that the history with the\n[3119.0s] that am had marked out in his word,\n[3122.0s] uniting link after link in the prophetic\n[3125.9s] chain from eternity in the past to\n[3128.6s] eternity in the future. Tell us where we\n[3131.0s] are today in this procession of the ages\n[3135.0s] and what may be expected in the time to\n[3138.2s] come. All that prophecy had foretold as\n[3141.8s] coming to pass and in the present time\n[3144.5s] has been traced on the pages of the\n[3147.1s] history and we may be assured that all\n[3151.1s] we which is yet to come will be\n[3153.0s] fulfilled in order. It mean that the\n[3155.5s] history which the greater put in the\n[3158.5s] ancient Israelites it is a prophetic\n[3160.7s] chain. It is a\n[3162.4s] chain. It is running in chain after\n[3165.0s] chain chain after chain. and also how\n[3167.4s] God has led his children. His children\n[3171.0s] how God has led his children. Because\n[3174.2s] when we are looking for the Adventist\n[3176.0s] movement, when we will go to the\n[3177.8s] midnight cry, we are finding that when\n[3180.0s] God when we think about Israelites, we\n[3183.5s] are seeing only\n[3184.8s] Moses. So no one can mention Israelites\n[3188.2s] before mentioning Mo Moses. Am I okay?\n[3191.9s] Also no one can mention seventh\n[3193.8s] adventist without talking of the\n[3196.0s] Millerite movement. Without talking on\n[3199.2s] the Millerite movement. Can you write\n[3200.6s] the parallel of Moses and me? As I\n[3203.4s] finishing that the parallel of Moses and\n[3205.9s] me that I may have easy time in the next\n[3208.5s] lesson not to have much of time. The\n[3210.4s] parallel of Moses and Miller. I know you\n[3212.7s] have right about Miller being army\n[3215.7s] officer and becoming a farmer. If you\n[3218.5s] read alo it is also being told in one\n[3220.5s] bio 19.4.\n[3221.9s] about the army officer and then becoming\n[3223.8s] a farm in but there's a parallel of\n[3228.0s] Moses and Miller first you should write\n[3231.0s] that both were called by God to lead his\n[3234.2s] people both were called by God to lead\n[3237.7s] his people Moses to lead God first\n[3241.1s] church and Miller to lead God's last\n[3244.2s] remnant church are we okay that as God\n[3248.2s] called Miller to lead God's remnant\n[3250.6s] church as also God called Moses to lead\n[3252.8s] his church from the wilderness. We are\n[3255.8s] going to see how they were were they\n[3257.8s] called. Number two, that both were\n[3261.9s] intelligent. Both were intelligent. Both\n[3266.0s] were intelligent. The book CTR\n[3268.8s] 100 CDR\n[3272.6s] 100 CDR both were intelligent.\n[3276.8s] CTR page number\n[3282.0s] 100. Thank\n[3285.5s] you. CTR page 100 number three is saying\n[3289.3s] that Moses was a man of\n[3291.6s] intelligence and God in\n[3294.4s] purpose in his providence placed him\n[3297.2s] where he could acquire knowledge and\n[3299.8s] fitness for the great work. He was\n[3303.0s] thoroughly educated as a general when he\n[3306.1s] went out to meet his enemy.\n[3309.2s] William was an\n[3313.3s] army. He was an army officer. And also\n[3318.0s] Moses first he was intelligent. Number\n[3321.4s] two he was educated in in military\n[3326.0s] training. He was educated in military\n[3329.8s] training. Are we seeing that second\n[3334.1s] parallel striking similarity? Are we\n[3337.0s] seeing it? That striking\n[3346.7s] similarity the same. Amen. Are we seeing\n[3350.0s] that similarity? Both were called by\n[3352.9s] God. Both both were intelligent. Let me\n[3356.3s] read for you of William GC. You you you\n[3360.4s] confirm\n[3362.5s] GC37.2 Great Controversy\n[3366.3s] 317.2 Great Controversy page 317\n[3369.0s] paragraph 2. Can you see\n[3372.4s] this? William Moses was intelligent.\n[3376.3s] Number two, he was trained in military\n[3380.0s] training or he was trained as a general\n[3382.8s] of the army officers. Read this GC\n[3387.7s] 317.2.\n[3389.4s] William Miller, he had a sound physical\n[3391.8s] constitution and even in childhood he\n[3394.9s] gave evidence of more than ordinary\n[3398.0s] intellectual train. Praise God. Was\n[3401.4s] Millia\n[3402.7s] intelligent? Was Moses\n[3405.5s] intelligent? Was Miller an army\n[3408.4s] officer? Was was Moses an army officer?\n[3412.6s] Was were they educated in military line?\n[3416.2s] It means that we are we are on the right\n[3418.6s] path of calling ourself Israelites\n[3421.0s] movement syndrome. You write point\n[3422.7s] number three. Read point number three.\n[3426.2s] Read point number three. Both were uh\n[3428.8s] taught and protected by\n[3431.0s] angels. Both were taught and protected\n[3433.7s] by angels. Both were taught by and\n[3436.6s] protected by\n[3437.8s] angels. PP\n[3439.9s] 245 paragraph number two. PP 245\n[3443.4s] paragraph number two.\n[3446.8s] PP 245 paragraph number two. Can you\n[3450.2s] see 245 paragraph number two is saying\n[3454.2s] that the the elders of Israelites were\n[3457.4s] taught the elders of Israeli Israel were\n[3461.6s] taught by angels that the time for their\n[3464.6s] deliverance was near and that Moses to\n[3467.2s] accomp that Moses was the man whom God\n[3470.3s] will employ to accomplish this work.\n[3474.0s] Angels\n[3475.7s] instructed Moses also that Jehovah had\n[3480.1s] chosen him to break the bondage of his\n[3482.8s] people. Who instructed\n[3485.5s] Moses? Who instructed Moses? What about\n[3488.9s] William Miller? Ali writings 229. You\n[3493.1s] see these are some of the simple\n[3496.1s] striking\n[3497.2s] similarity. Ali writings 229. Can you\n[3500.2s] see this also? Can you see this also?\n[3503.5s] You know that we are\n[3506.6s] 229 paragraph number one. Can you see\n[3509.8s] it's saying that God sent his angel to\n[3514.3s] move upon the heart of what? A farmer\n[3517.2s] who had not believed the B the Bible to\n[3520.9s] lead him to search the prophecy. Angels\n[3523.5s] of God repeated revisited that chosen\n[3526.2s] one to guard his mind and to open to his\n[3529.8s] understanding the prophecies which has\n[3532.1s] ever been dark to the to God's people.\n[3535.5s] Those were instructed and taught by\n[3538.9s] angels. Another one let me ask you first\n[3542.3s] William was a military Moses was also\n[3545.8s] military.\n[3549.7s] What is\n[3568.2s] agricult? It means that everything will\n[3570.6s] be okay. Let me read the last one.\n[3575.1s] This I will read. Both s not the\n[3577.0s] promised land and both are going to\n[3580.1s] heaven. Praise God. Both s not the\n[3583.8s] promised land but both are all going to\n[3588.2s] we are going to meet William Miller in\n[3590.0s] heaven. Praise God. But Moses is in\n[3592.2s] heaven right now. Let me give you one\n[3595.2s] evidence. Early writings p 257 258. You\n[3598.7s] also understand that as we are\n[3600.8s] understanding that there's a striking\n[3602.4s] similarity between William Miller and\n[3604.7s] Moses Oen White understood it that way.\n[3607.8s] Early writings page page 250\n[3612.6s] 258 258 paragraph number one as I\n[3616.7s] conclude as I go to conclusion it say\n[3621.4s] this was a mistake done by William\n[3623.7s] Miller but there's something which\n[3625.4s] happened let me read I will start with\n[3627.2s] paragraph number one you go with me mark\n[3629.4s] that point they read clearly read\n[3631.8s] clearly it's saying that if William\n[3634.5s] Miller have seen the light of the third\n[3637.0s] angel's message. Many things which look\n[3639.5s] dark and mysterious to him would have\n[3642.2s] been explained. But his brethren\n[3645.0s] professed so deep love and interest for\n[3647.5s] him that he thought he could not tear\n[3651.0s] away from them. His heart will incline\n[3653.7s] toward the truth and then he looked as\n[3656.1s] his brethren they opposed it. Was Moses\n[3659.3s] also posted? You are going to\n[3661.8s] understand. Could he tear away from\n[3664.3s] those who had stood side by side with\n[3666.3s] him in proclamation of the Jesus? He\n[3669.5s] thought they they surely would not lead\n[3673.0s] him astray. The last one, God suffered\n[3677.0s] him to fall under the power of Satan,\n[3679.9s] the dominion of\n[3681.6s] death, and hid him in the grave for\n[3684.6s] those who were constantly drawing him\n[3686.4s] from the truth. Moses aired as he was\n[3690.9s] about to enter the\n[3692.7s] promised. So also I saw that William\n[3695.9s] Miller aired as he was soon to enter the\n[3700.0s] heavenly in suffering his influence to\n[3702.9s] the against the truth. Others led him to\n[3705.8s] this. Others must account for it. But\n[3708.9s] angels watched the precious death of\n[3711.8s] this servant and he will come forth at\n[3714.6s] the sound of the last triumph. Praise\n[3716.2s] God. Will we meet William in heaven?\n[3719.9s] Praise God. Others will be\n[3722.4s] accountable. Others will are going to be\n[3724.7s] what? To be accountable. It means that\n[3726.6s] there's a a serious striking similarity\n[3729.9s] between the uh between the Israelites\n[3733.4s] and also between the advent of the\n[3735.8s] Millerite movement. I know my time is\n[3738.1s] spent, but when I'm coming, I will look\n[3740.7s] for the Miller associates and the menite\n[3743.1s] crying. As I go to the division of the\n[3745.4s] Millerite movement, we're going to in\n[3747.0s] that division looking to the division in\n[3749.5s] the Millerite movement. I leave the\n[3751.5s] Millerite movement. I come to the\n[3753.3s] sabatarian what\n[3755.2s] Adventist Sabatarian Adventist. I know\n[3757.7s] I'm I'm going to the birth of the\n[3759.9s] remnant church and we the bath of the\n[3762.2s] remnant church contain a lot of things.\n[3763.9s] I know there is where\n[3766.8s] to the bath and the progress of the\n[3769.3s] remnant church. We want to look our\n[3772.0s] birth. We want our church back. Praise\n[3774.1s] God. We are crying to God that God may\n[3776.9s] you give us our church\n[3778.5s] back. But we we are going to look that\n[3781.4s] what is that our church? What is that\n[3783.5s] our church? It will get time. I know I'm\n[3786.6s] going to look the found you know we are\n[3788.4s] being told that the foundation of our\n[3790.8s] when we want to look our foundation it\n[3793.1s] is the in the great adventist movement\n[3795.4s] of the year 1840 to the year\n[3799.2s] 1844. Let can I should conclude at that\n[3803.0s] point then let's everyone have a\n[3805.5s] question I I shall pray then I give that\n[3808.3s] time can we\n[3819.8s] pray and God in heaven glory honor and\n[3823.3s] adoration be unto thee and thy son the\n[3826.1s] plan of redemption that thou have set\n[3827.9s] that we might be redeemed unto the\n[3829.4s] perfect image of thy son. Thank you for\n[3832.1s] clearly showing us the striking\n[3834.5s] illustration, the parallel of the\n[3836.8s] Israelites and the Adventist movement\n[3838.4s] and also of the little bit of Millerite\n[3840.8s] movement. You know, if time will allow\n[3843.0s] as we are continuing the lesson of the\n[3844.6s] church heritage, we will clearly\n[3846.6s] understand the Millerite movement and\n[3848.2s] all questions. May you help us to settle\n[3850.1s] in. Above all, God in heaven, help the\n[3852.7s] teachers that are coming before me and\n[3855.2s] let all these things be printed in our\n[3857.0s] mind. For I pray in Jesus name.\n[3864.9s] [Music]"

The high calling of the home maker. The homemaker in the kitchen. Who is the homemaker? Someone who makes the home. from the simple definition. Um I wanted to read something to the health and happiness of the whole family. Nothing is more vital than skill and intelligence of the part of the cook. There must be something called skill and intelligence. Cooking is not uh just going to the kitchen and beginning to prepare just like our old uh parents have done and we have done that is not cooking. Cooking we must learn on how to do them and uh you must have that intelligence. The science of cooking is not a small matter. The foundation of that which keeps people in health is the medical missionary work of good cooking. In the morning I heard someone saying that we should begin with building schools uh and sanitariums and all those uh and saying medical missionary work which is sanitarium. Let me tell us one thing. The work of cooking uh helpful presenting helpful meal before your uh household every day is a work of medical missionary work and uh that work is very important by the way medical what is medical missionary work it's the right arm of the gospel right it is an entering wage it is the um it is in the first second Angel's message it penetrates through the heart of the people so that the people may be able to receive the gospel. One of the things we use not everyone can be uh a nurse, not everyone can be can be able to minister to the sick. Not everyone can preach. But there are some people who can do uh good cooking and good cooking will be able to penetrate the hearts of men and women and they need be able to do what? To accept the gospel. Um one last thing I'm going to read. Scanty listen to this very carefully. Scanty incooked food deprivives the blood by weakening the blood making organs. I I need a hand being raised. What are the blood making organs? Anatomy and physiology. Ministry of healing says do not be a mother if you cannot understand the anatomy and physiology of the family members of your own. How can you minister to your own child or your husband or even yourself not understand how the body works or how the body has been built? Yeah. What is the blood making orans? Don't get where the blood is [Music] being right. So if you have prepared food, you're weakening where blood is made. And when the uh the place where the blood the blood is weakened do we have proper blood and when you don't have proper blood do you have proper circulation of blood and when there is no proper circulation of blood inherent and brings with acment bad tempers. The victim of thousands and tens of thousands of how many died of an abused stole when I can't get the page because it was telling us that almost everyone knows what makes our right gives us energy to be able to work every brain uh nerves or the liver in to be able to pump blood. They need water that is converted to blood and that bloods the be very well. So I finished my theory. We must know how to do well. Then say even if she says even if she was 40 years old she would even go to somewhere where she can learn how to because you have the life of your family in your hands your own life and the life of your family in your own heart of which cannot preach. when farmers go without being cooked well because the brain develop your brain develop well if the food you are eating is empty and ill prepared. Is it true? The reason why many people those who have flesh and those who have this fruit that has passions brings the why preachers they cannot preach the truth or the gospel that is uh that can sanctify their hearts is because they eating cannot make And when your plant is starting romantically, you don't have the brain not have the energy to lose the things you need or to grant the skins that the Lord wants to have. So today we don't have much. We only have some ingredients before us. How many put garlic in their homes? Maybe white garlic. You don't use maybe but now we can make a living from eaten. Women usually act and we we are about thness. We every day the same things uh and we give them that is not today back [Music] then. But they are being based on how to on how to score you it's not only cooking it. How many hours you can use the diet? So today simple to prepare very simple yellow. How many tasting yellow? It has that sweetness. We have more than 10. We have beautiful binding. We only going to use it very of course to maintain but because we don't have we going to use wheat for we have butter you can use if you like jewelry for sweetener and oil. You can use honey if you have you can use banana. Some people have lots of bananas in their homes. You can even porridge very sweet. So you can add banana used What did you eat? If you don't have a blender, you can grate the coconut. You can mash smash. Bananas are also smashed. But your mouth. I'd [Music] like you. Anybody? I just want to makes That's crazy. If you have can use the the lemon secretation of course if you're cooking this one can stay even for a week or two weeks. So you have lemon or ginger. Here we have three kinds of Thank you. Those are ridiculous. Okay. You can boil so that you may reduce the water to it. You can blend it the way I want to blend because of the Thank you. So 3 to one mobile. color. What is she? The next step. So we going to add salt here a little when you are baking oil is better if you don't I see people adding oil after they added the oil you want to mix with it now so it's better you add it So we think we have to have question. Thank you. Was it you have Yes. But I don't get some kind between [Music] How many things do you know that wishes. How many do you know that I wish country bridge? potatoes can be I hope you're seeing I'm going to Let's move. So, she has the lemon. We're going to add dry ingredients. Then after that now you're going to add this mix. You're at home just playing with things around. Of course, at first it won't be that perfect, but when you have things like Don't just cook for children. You cook until you don't for them and for them children. They love it so much. children very differently Not sure. What do you mean? in I think about something locally. Using sand. Okay. Yeah. You can use that in back. It's called manual. The one we use, but you can use you can use the the super. So you buy very stable. Yeah, [Music] So this this one is this is that we At least I'm with it and want to eat it. You don't put soft just like very soft. This [Music] one is best. Imagine How many even have people have been taught now and then people are calling teach us teach us but when they go back home they do the same things you want to be taught on how to do this on how to do this but when they go back someone told me teaching how to cook to then she was So at the end of the day when she went home she's taken one and a half without even trying to because she said I I don't even have time. It is so tires making that food. You see people want to be taught but they don't tell the effort. Sister wife says if you are a woman and you don't tell the to do that then you are destroying the life of what? very fast and then they they bring to the table and people have no time when you look there for several hours can agree they wasted right so if you can't do them it's better don't even go try to go just but at the end of the day because you need to avoid that. What's the substitute for me? Don't have that crush for spreading. You're going to spread the government. [Music] This is My phone need to find I'm going to spray it because we have a very small tree. It is only this one. So I'm not going to do the balls. Balls will take a lot of time. You're just going to spread it here then. You just spread I won't stretch. I'm batting them. You don't act like princess. Okay. What is talking about? That's for decoration. For decoration or anything like Yeah, sure. [Music] That is She does no more. That's come down. How long will it [Music] temperature? Jesus. time. Why don't you What I don't feel so between living and [Music] Yeah. And the inside it's always very well. But when you do this unlimited when you get it to behave science cannot raise because it cannot raise. So this is unleven and so the living the living one must be reb has to be reb so that the may [Music] but this one this one is sweeter and doesn't like but is also sweet. Awesome. Yeah. It is it cannot be digested. Go and read when you are when you're doing the raising bread raising bread. It doesn't digest well when it's soft. But that one I don't know so that we can reb again. When it re you rebel to do what is called Yes. No stain or noises should be me. When you're doing the she that one can stay for very long you reake it again it becomes fresh can even stay for a year that's a So we always it will become very hard because it because it has this The repeating of the yeast should be cut into moisture the moisture all traces of moisture from you can't bake it. Any other question? 3 2 1 [Music] 3iscal with this only have oils on the flour and want that taste of that sweet taste within orange. So at the end of the day, we have biscuit that is chilled and sweet. How long does it take? 20 30 days. But if you have manual, you won't keep checking. Keep check. Apart from which another which another of our bread? Yeah. when we like the one we do I think it's after tomorrow day after tomorrow we have [Music] orodium as much as we're doing it once. That is actually Fore speech. [Music] So, uh, I've used ash. I've used ash to make a sound. I've used to make it rise. So, both of them that should be living here if it must be alive. It must be alive because automatically when you placed it in warm water it will with some small amount of sweetener. has when it does not use the blood as a bind itself. A little bite. Yeah, we can use those. I've done my research. Someone told me plantain. Yeah. Yeah. He told me that that he needed one always from those who has it. [Music] for your duration. Just put some twists there. Oh, before you bring as simple as one more time. When are you going to put those ones? is very second. Anything else? No, it was confident. mater. By the way, what is the science of of long several be more surface area because I have some graphic surface. Yeah. The reason why you should do that. Perfect. We Why don't we take raw fruits and we take fruits? No. We take we take several Those who imply that I want to raise [Music] uh the start of the graen down. They need quite they need quite so that they can be exam. So for you to break them down which needs to be [Music] there. So you find out There's something called gra Right. For this to be broken down, the the dried grain for it to be turned back to grave has to go through this. And how how does it go through [Music] this heat and there is some What? That is how the grains. No, the fruits. How does the fruit become ripped? They are on the tree. They have the air and they have the sunlight. That is what makes the fruit go to be sweet. Okay. To have that is about the grape. By the raw fruit is not digestion in the end. Fruit or grain? Raw fruit or unripen. Yeah. And fruit. Yeah, that is what I unripened fruit. You must take something. It is not digested. It's like the raw brain is not digested. That is the same way I used to give those things from form of several months to return back to the process of heat and air breaks it down and returns it back to the grave for so that it may be easily digested in the body just like the fruits are easily digested when they are ripened. Right? So that is the science behind several things. It is not just the service. [Music] You are that oil is not supposed to be exposed to high degrees of heat and in the oven it is so hot and you not supposed to be exposed to fat and why And then you told her never to do so. I [Music] already bring our nature. really it's what happened at [Music] all. You have to the same. So there are different generated [Music] We need [Music] [Music] so that is all in You think there's some air so we reduce that That's basically why treated oil kinds of oil they treated hydrogen was a daughter never. So that question I think to do so I went and did some research on here. both hydrogenated which is supposed to be heated because first of all that hydrogenated the small smoke point is somehow high comparing all compressed ones and the effects of the heat is that he break down and form the energy which are harmful to our health and so it is like much more important if we have this congress We shouldn't expose it to heat. It will be much advised to hydrogenated. All of them have an effect because those bomb that they have whenever they're exposed to it they break down the breaking down the you know in chemistry. [Music] [Music] So the oil has when they heated they break down and they form free radically as the name is free and they are trying to say I don't know how oil is not like such a decision. It will also be dangerous looking even now to do it by the point and which is okay. So you understand I don't know it's it can just be okay as soon as it's ready. Yeah. Then you go back without testing how to make bread. Go and try it. somebody use the the can use any kind of question. [Music] But inside just for the end that And that is not that. Uh I know during the time this I mean uh maybe we can just he and then we will do research. It is very true. There are no so that we know you are talking. We shall pray. Thank you so much for the session. Thank you for the knowledge that you may give us able to work in your home and uh can't have good health yet. preaching one to close the s give us the strength to overcome the s in Jesus name. Amen.",

Nothing is more vital\n[89.1s] than skill and intelligence of the part\n[91.9s] of the cook. There must be something\n[95.3s] called skill and intelligence. Cooking\n[99.1s] is not uh just going to the kitchen and\n[103.0s] beginning to prepare just like our old\n[105.9s] uh parents have done and we have done\n[108.5s] that is not cooking. Cooking we must\n[110.6s] learn on how to do them and uh you must\n[115.4s] have that intelligence. The science of\n[118.3s] cooking is not a small matter.\n[123.7s] The foundation of that which keeps\n[126.5s] people in health is the medical\n[128.2s] missionary work of good cooking. In the\n[131.0s] morning I heard someone saying that we\n[133.7s] should begin with building schools\n[137.2s] uh and sanitariums and all those uh and\n[141.9s] saying medical missionary work which is\n[144.7s] sanitarium. Let me tell us one thing.\n[148.1s] The work of\n[149.7s] cooking uh helpful presenting helpful\n[153.8s] meal before your uh household every day\n[158.6s] is a work of medical missionary\n[161.2s] work and uh that work is very important\n[165.3s] by the way medical what is medical\n[167.4s] missionary work it's the right arm of\n[169.1s] the gospel right it is an entering wage\n[173.4s] it is the um it is in the first second\n[177.8s] Angel's message it penetrates through\n[181.4s] the heart of the people so that the\n[183.9s] people may be able to receive the\n[186.4s] gospel. One of the things we use not\n[189.4s] everyone can be uh a nurse, not everyone\n[193.4s] can\n[195.2s] be can be able to minister to the sick.\n[198.6s] Not everyone can preach. But there are\n[200.9s] some people who can do uh good cooking\n[204.6s] and good cooking will be able to\n[207.2s] penetrate the hearts of men and women\n[209.8s] and they need be able to do what? To\n[211.7s] accept the\n[213.0s] gospel.\n[214.5s] Um one last thing I'm going to read.\n[218.4s] Scanty listen to this very carefully.\n[222.4s] Scanty incooked food deprivives the\n[226.1s] blood by weakening the blood making\n[228.8s] organs.\n[230.4s] I I need a hand being raised. What are\n[233.3s] the blood making\n[238.9s] organs? Anatomy and physiology. Ministry\n[242.4s] of healing says do not be a mother if\n[245.4s] you cannot\n[246.9s] understand the anatomy and physiology of\n[249.9s] the family members of your own. How can\n[253.6s] you minister to your own child or your\n[256.6s] husband or even yourself not understand\n[259.1s] how the body\n[260.7s] works or how the body has been\n[265.2s] built? Yeah. What is the blood making\n[267.8s] orans?\n[282.6s] Don't get\n[286.7s] where the blood is\n[287.6s] [Music]\n[294.0s] being right. So if you\n[299.2s] have prepared food, you're weakening\n[302.9s] where blood is made. And when the uh the\n[307.0s] place where the blood the blood is\n[309.8s] weakened do we have proper\n[312.5s] blood and when you don't have proper\n[315.2s] blood do you have proper circulation of\n[317.0s] blood and when there is no proper\n[319.1s] circulation of\n[321.7s] blood\n[328.1s] inherent and\n[330.4s] brings with acment\n[334.6s] bad tempers. The victim\n[338.0s] of thousands and tens of thousands of\n[341.7s] how\n[343.0s] many\n[346.9s] died of an\n[349.1s] abused\n[352.4s] stole when\n[374.5s] I can't get the page\n[376.1s] because it was telling us\n[379.7s] that almost everyone\n[382.1s] knows what makes our\n[386.4s] right gives us energy to be able to work\n[391.6s] every brain\n[394.1s] uh nerves\n[396.2s] or the liver in to be able to pump\n[400.5s] blood. They need\n[404.9s] water that is converted to blood and\n[408.7s] that bloods\n[410.6s] the\n[412.1s] be very well.\n[417.2s] So I finished my\n[420.6s] theory. We must know how to do well.\n[424.4s] Then say even\n[432.9s] if she says even if she was 40 years old\n[436.8s] she would even go to somewhere where she\n[439.6s] can learn how\n[442.5s] to because you have the life of your\n[445.8s] family in your hands your own life and\n[449.0s] the life of your family in your own\n[451.4s] heart of which cannot preach.\n[455.7s] when farmers go without being cooked\n[461.4s] well\n[463.4s] because the brain develop your brain\n[466.9s] develop well if the food you are eating\n[470.2s] is empty and ill\n[472.8s] prepared. Is it true?\n[476.2s] The reason why many people those who\n[478.9s] have flesh and those who\n[483.3s] have this\n[485.2s] fruit that has\n[489.9s] passions\n[492.2s] brings the why preachers they cannot\n[495.8s] preach the truth or the gospel that is\n[498.4s] uh that can sanctify their hearts is\n[502.2s] because they eating cannot make\n[507.0s] And when your plant is starting\n[509.2s] romantically, you don't\n[511.4s] have the brain not have the energy\n[518.8s] to lose the things you need or to\n[523.9s] grant the skins that the Lord wants to\n[527.1s] have. So\n[528.8s] today we don't have much. We only have\n[536.2s] some ingredients before us. How many put\n[539.4s] garlic in their homes? Maybe\n[542.4s] white\n[544.9s] garlic. You don't\n[548.1s] use maybe but\n[551.9s] now we can make a\n[561.4s] living from eaten.\n[567.0s] Women usually\n[574.0s] act and we we are about thness.\n[580.3s] We every day the same things\n[583.8s] uh and we give them that is\n[590.7s] not\n[592.8s] today back\n[603.0s] [Music]\n[607.2s] then. But they are being based on how to\n[610.8s] on how to score you it's not\n[614.8s] only cooking it.\n[629.8s] How many hours\n[647.4s] you can\n[651.7s] use the\n[657.5s] diet? So today simple to prepare very\n[669.9s] simple\n[673.9s] yellow. How many tasting yellow? It has\n[677.4s] that\n[682.1s] sweetness. We have more than 10.\n[687.9s] We have beautiful binding. We only going\n[691.3s] to use it\n[696.0s] very of\n[700.0s] course to maintain but because we don't\n[704.4s] have we going to use wheat\n[707.8s] for we\n[709.7s] have\n[711.6s] butter you can\n[713.6s] use if you\n[715.9s] like jewelry\n[720.6s] for\n[721.6s] sweetener and oil. You can use honey if\n[725.6s] you\n[727.6s] have you can use banana. Some people\n[731.0s] have lots of bananas in their homes.\n[744.9s] You can even\n[748.5s] porridge very sweet. So you can add\n[752.4s] banana used\n[771.4s] What did you eat?\n[783.9s] If you don't have a blender, you can\n[788.4s] grate the coconut. You can mash\n[794.0s] smash. Bananas are also smashed.\n[803.5s] But your mouth.\n[807.8s] I'd\n[810.7s] [Music]\n[825.5s] like\n[829.9s] you. Anybody?\n[868.9s] I just want to\n[885.7s] makes\n[907.1s] That's crazy.\n[964.7s] If you\n[966.9s] have can use the the lemon\n[972.7s] secretation of course if you're\n[975.9s] cooking this one can stay even for a\n[978.9s] week or two\n[982.3s] weeks. So you have lemon or\n[986.5s] ginger. Here we have three kinds of\n[1017.8s] Thank\n[1031.5s] you.\n[1042.0s] Those are ridiculous.\n[1081.6s] Okay. You can boil so that you may\n[1085.7s] reduce the water to it.\n[1088.6s] You can blend it the way I want\n[1091.2s] to\n[1093.9s] blend\n[1095.6s] because of the\n[1112.9s] Thank you.\n[1162.4s] So 3 to\n[1164.6s] one mobile.\n[1187.8s] color.\n[1210.1s] What is she?\n[1238.3s] The next\n[1254.0s] step. So we going to add\n[1257.4s] salt\n[1259.2s] here a\n[1261.3s] little when you are\n[1263.8s] baking oil is better if you\n[1271.4s] don't I see people adding oil after they\n[1277.1s] added the oil you want to mix with it\n[1279.8s] now so it's better you add it\n[1286.6s] So we think\n[1291.8s] we have\n[1293.3s] to\n[1303.8s] have question.\n[1312.5s] Thank\n[1323.7s] you.\n[1327.2s] Was it you have\n[1348.8s] Yes. But\n[1359.1s] I don't\n[1376.8s] get some kind\n[1378.9s] between\n[1423.1s] [Music]\n[1425.5s] How many things do you know that\n[1432.6s] wishes.\n[1442.5s] How many do you know\n[1464.0s] that I wish country bridge?\n[1469.9s] potatoes can be\n[1488.5s] I hope you're seeing I'm going\n[1492.6s] to\n[1497.8s] Let's move.\n[1511.6s] So, she has the\n[1513.3s] lemon. We're going to add dry\n[1516.2s] ingredients.\n[1539.0s] Then after that now you're going to add\n[1540.8s] this mix.\n[1568.6s] You're at home just playing with things\n[1570.4s] around. Of course, at first it won't be\n[1572.6s] that\n[1573.4s] perfect, but when you have things like\n[1577.7s] Don't just cook for\n[1579.9s] children. You cook\n[1582.9s] until you\n[1588.5s] don't for them and for\n[1591.7s] them\n[1594.8s] children. They love it so much.\n[1629.2s] children very differently\n[1633.3s] Not sure.\n[1637.8s] What do you mean?\n[1659.4s] in\n[1666.0s] I think about something locally.\n[1676.2s] Using sand. Okay. Yeah. You can use that\n[1680.8s] in\n[1687.0s] back. It's called\n[1690.0s] manual. The one we\n[1692.4s] use, but you can use you can use the the\n[1698.4s] super. So you buy very stable.\n[1717.0s] Yeah,\n[1756.5s] [Music]\n[1759.4s] So this this one is this\n[1762.0s] is that we At least\n[1768.8s] I'm with it and want to eat it.\n[1776.7s] You don't put\n[1788.0s] soft just\n[1791.7s] like very\n[1793.7s] soft. This\n[1798.7s] [Music]\n[1802.7s] one is\n[1821.5s] best. Imagine\n[1854.7s] How many even have\n[1858.4s] people have been\n[1860.8s] taught now and then people are calling\n[1863.4s] teach us teach us but when they go back\n[1865.7s] home they do the same things\n[1870.6s] you want to be taught on how to do this\n[1872.5s] on how to do this but when they go back\n[1875.6s] someone told me teaching how to cook to\n[1879.1s] then she was So at the end of the day\n[1881.4s] when she went home she's taken one and a\n[1884.7s] half without even trying to because she\n[1888.2s] said I I don't even have time. It is so\n[1892.2s] tires making that food. You see people\n[1896.0s] want to be taught but they don't tell\n[1899.4s] the effort. Sister wife says if you are\n[1901.9s] a woman and you don't tell the to do\n[1904.0s] that then you are destroying the life of\n[1906.4s] what?\n[1908.9s] very\n[1911.6s] fast and then they they bring to the\n[1915.0s] table and people have no time when you\n[1918.5s] look\n[1920.4s] there for several hours can agree they\n[1925.1s] wasted right\n[1929.9s] so if you can't do them it's better\n[1933.7s] don't even go\n[1937.9s] try to go\n[1940.2s] just but at the end of the day because\n[1943.4s] you\n[1962.8s] need to avoid that.\n[1967.8s] What's the substitute\n[1970.1s] for me?\n[2011.4s] Don't have that crush for\n[2014.5s] spreading. You're going to spread the\n[2016.5s] government.\n[2017.4s] [Music]\n[2019.3s] This is\n[2023.1s] My\n[2026.6s] phone need to find\n[2073.4s] I'm going to spray it because we have a\n[2075.9s] very small tree. It is only this one. So\n[2079.6s] I'm not going to do the balls. Balls\n[2082.2s] will take a lot of time. You're just\n[2083.8s] going to spread it here\n[2089.0s] then. You just spread\n[2110.6s] I won't stretch.\n[2162.0s] I'm batting them.\n[2166.7s] You don't act like princess.\n[2179.9s] Okay.\n[2193.6s] What\n[2215.6s] is talking about?\n[2228.2s] That's for decoration.\n[2230.6s] For decoration or anything like\n[2243.0s] Yeah, sure.\n[2270.2s] [Music]\n[2276.0s] That is\n[2294.0s] She does no more.\n[2297.9s] That's come down.\n[2305.4s] How long will it\n[2312.7s] [Music]\n[2328.4s] temperature? Jesus.\n[2343.8s] time.\n[2386.8s] Why don't you\n[2405.5s] What I don't feel\n[2422.8s] so\n[2424.8s] between living and\n[2436.9s] [Music]\n[2438.2s] Yeah. And the inside it's always\n[2443.4s] very well. But when you do\n[2446.1s] this unlimited when you get it to behave\n[2450.6s] science cannot raise because it cannot\n[2455.2s] raise.\n[2458.3s] So this is unleven\n[2461.0s] and so the living the living one must be\n[2463.8s] reb\n[2466.7s] has to be reb so that the may\n[2470.3s] [Music]\n[2473.4s] but this\n[2475.2s] one this one is sweeter\n[2479.8s] and\n[2483.4s] doesn't like but is also sweet.\n[2491.0s] Awesome.\n[2493.8s] Yeah.\n[2501.9s] It is it cannot be digested. Go and\n[2507.2s] read when you are when you're doing the\n[2513.0s] raising bread raising bread.\n[2516.0s] It\n[2517.2s] doesn't\n[2519.0s] digest well when it's soft.\n[2536.6s] But that\n[2545.1s] one I don't\n[2554.8s] know so that we can reb again.\n[2562.0s] When\n[2563.7s] it re you rebel to do what is called\n[2582.7s] Yes. No stain or noises should be me.\n[2586.8s] When you're doing the\n[2589.4s] she that one can stay for very long\n[2593.2s] you reake it again it becomes\n[2596.2s] fresh can even stay for a year\n[2604.4s] that's a\n[2617.0s] So we always\n[2629.3s] it will become very hard because it\n[2632.8s] because it has this\n[2637.1s] The repeating of the yeast should be cut\n[2643.6s] into moisture the moisture all traces of\n[2647.6s] moisture\n[2652.4s] from you can't bake\n[2659.2s] it. Any other question?\n[2670.5s] 3 2 1\n[2682.0s] [Music]\n[2688.0s] 3iscal with this\n[2699.8s] only have oils on the\n[2704.4s] flour and want that taste of that sweet\n[2711.3s] taste within orange.\n[2716.6s] So at the end of the day, we have\n[2718.9s] biscuit that is chilled and sweet.\n[2728.9s] How long does it take?\n[2732.6s] 20 30 days.\n[2736.6s] But if you have manual, you won't keep\n[2739.8s] checking. Keep\n[2741.7s] check. Apart\n[2744.1s] from which another which\n[2749.2s] another of our bread? Yeah. when\n[2753.7s] we like the one we do I think it's after\n[2758.3s] tomorrow day after tomorrow we have\n[2765.4s] [Music]\n[2767.0s] orodium\n[2799.2s] as much as we're doing it once.\n[2809.6s] That is\n[2827.6s] actually Fore speech.\n[2835.2s] [Music]\n[2848.5s] So, uh, I've used ash.\n[2853.5s] I've used ash to make a sound. I've used\n[2860.1s] to make it rise.\n[2862.4s] So, both of them\n[2874.9s] that should be living\n[2878.0s] here if\n[2883.2s] it must be alive. It must be alive\n[2885.3s] because automatically when you placed it\n[2888.3s] in warm water it will with some small\n[2892.4s] amount of sweetener. has when it does\n[2897.2s] not\n[2906.8s] use the blood as a\n[2922.9s] bind itself.\n[2928.2s] A little bite.\n[2931.8s] Yeah, we can\n[2935.1s] use those.\n[2944.6s] I've done my research. Someone told me\n[2961.7s] plantain. Yeah.\n[2980.7s] Yeah. He told me that that he\n[2984.8s] needed one\n[2986.8s] always from those\n[2990.0s] who has it.\n[2992.8s] [Music]\n[2995.7s] for\n[2997.2s] your duration. Just put some\n[3002.3s] twists there.\n[3020.8s] Oh, before you bring\n[3034.3s] as simple\n[3049.6s] as one more time.\n[3054.6s] When are you going to put those ones?\n[3071.2s] is\n[3083.1s] very second.\n[3095.0s] Anything else?\n[3112.4s] No, it was confident.\n[3144.2s] mater. By the way, what is the science\n[3146.3s] of\n[3148.1s] of\n[3150.2s] long several be\n[3160.1s] more surface area\n[3163.1s] because I have\n[3165.6s] some\n[3173.5s] graphic surface.\n[3184.2s] Yeah. The reason why\n[3187.7s] you should do that. Perfect. We Why\n[3191.4s] don't we take raw fruits and we take\n[3194.9s] fruits?\n[3196.4s] No. We\n[3201.1s] take we take several\n[3206.2s] Those who imply that I want to raise\n[3223.9s] [Music]\n[3248.8s] uh the start of the\n[3252.4s] graen down. They need quite they need\n[3258.3s] quite so that they can\n[3261.6s] be exam.\n[3265.2s] So for you\n[3267.9s] to break them\n[3270.7s] down which needs to\n[3275.6s] be\n[3279.2s] [Music]\n[3284.4s] there. So you find out\n[3300.4s] There's something called gra\n[3307.7s] Right.\n[3322.5s] For this to be broken\n[3325.0s] down, the the\n[3328.0s] dried grain for it to be turned back to\n[3332.2s] grave has to go through this. And how\n[3335.5s] how does it go through\n[3341.6s] [Music]\n[3347.1s] this heat and there is some\n[3360.8s] What? That is how the\n[3363.6s] grains. No, the\n[3366.8s] fruits. How does the fruit\n[3371.2s] become\n[3372.8s] ripped? They are on the tree. They have\n[3377.1s] the air and they have the sunlight. That\n[3380.6s] is what makes the fruit go to be sweet.\n[3383.5s] Okay. To have that is about the grape.\n[3387.2s] By the raw fruit is not digestion in the\n[3390.0s] end.\n[3392.6s] Fruit or grain? Raw fruit\n[3395.9s] or unripen. Yeah. And fruit. Yeah, that\n[3400.2s] is what I unripened fruit. You must take\n[3408.9s] something. It is not digested.\n[3412.2s] It's like the raw brain is not digested.\n[3414.9s] That is the same\n[3418.8s] way\n[3424.8s] I used to give those things from\n[3434.1s] form\n[3436.9s] of several months to return back to the\n[3441.3s] process of heat and air breaks it down\n[3445.7s] and returns it back to the grave for so\n[3448.6s] that it may be easily digested in the\n[3451.3s] body just like the fruits are easily\n[3453.4s] digested when they are ripened. Right?\n[3456.2s] So that is the science\n[3457.9s] behind several things. It is not just\n[3463.0s] the service.\n[3475.2s] [Music]\n[3489.0s] You are that oil is not supposed to be\n[3491.7s] exposed\n[3493.6s] to high degrees of heat and in the oven\n[3498.6s] it is so\n[3502.0s] hot and\n[3504.5s] you not supposed to be exposed to\n[3509.2s] fat\n[3510.8s] and why And then you told her never to\n[3515.7s] do so.\n[3541.3s] I\n[3550.8s] [Music]\n[3558.2s] already bring our nature.\n[3570.7s] really\n[3573.3s] it's what happened at\n[3584.2s] [Music]\n[3588.0s] all. You have to\n[3601.0s] the\n[3604.4s] same. So there are\n[3609.1s] different generated\n[3612.9s] [Music]\n[3626.9s] We need\n[3631.5s] [Music]\n[3638.3s] [Music]\n[3644.9s] so that is all in\n[3659.0s] You think there's some air so we\n[3671.9s] reduce\n[3675.4s] that That's\n[3679.7s] basically why treated\n[3682.4s] oil kinds of oil they treated\n[3692.8s] hydrogen\n[3703.2s] was a daughter never.\n[3709.6s] So that question I\n[3713.2s] think to do\n[3732.0s] so I went and did some research on here.\n[3738.5s] both hydrogenated which is supposed to\n[3741.9s] be heated because first of all that\n[3746.2s] hydrogenated the small smoke point is\n[3749.4s] somehow high comparing all compressed\n[3752.0s] ones and the effects of the heat is that\n[3755.8s] he break down and form the energy which\n[3759.1s] are harmful to our health and so it is\n[3762.0s] like much more important if we have this\n[3764.4s] congress\n[3765.2s] We shouldn't expose it to heat. It will\n[3767.4s] be much\n[3778.1s] advised to hydrogenated. All of them\n[3781.6s] have an effect because those bomb that\n[3784.0s] they have whenever they're exposed to it\n[3785.8s] they break down\n[3792.6s] the breaking down the you know in\n[3795.8s] chemistry.\n[3797.1s] [Music]\n[3802.6s] [Music]\n[3804.2s] So the oil has when they heated they\n[3808.6s] break down and they form free\n[3815.3s] radically as the name is free and they\n[3824.3s] are trying to\n[3830.0s] say I don't know how\n[3845.2s] oil\n[3848.0s] is not\n[3856.1s] like such a decision. It will also be\n[3861.3s] dangerous looking\n[3866.1s] even\n[3870.1s] now to do it\n[3876.4s] by the point and which is okay. So\n[3882.9s] you understand\n[3892.6s] I don't know it's\n[3894.9s] it can just be okay\n[3901.0s] as soon as it's ready.\n[3904.9s] Yeah. Then you go back without testing\n[3907.5s] how to make bread. Go and try it.\n[3911.9s] somebody use\n[3913.5s] the\n[3915.4s] the can use any kind\n[3919.3s] of question.\n[3926.6s] [Music]\n[3943.0s] But inside just\n[3952.3s] for\n[3966.9s] the end that\n[3971.2s] And that\n[3978.8s] is not that.\n[3981.8s] Uh I know during the time this I\n[3989.6s] mean uh maybe we can\n[3995.6s] just\n[4002.0s] he and then we will do research. It is\n[4004.9s] very true. There are\n[4008.2s] no so that we\n[4015.9s] know you are talking.\n[4022.1s] We shall pray.\n[4033.2s] Thank you so much for the\n[4036.3s] session. Thank you for the\n[4039.1s] knowledge that you\n[4042.1s] may give us able to work\n[4053.5s] in your home and uh can't have good\n[4057.8s] health yet. preaching one to close the\n[4061.6s] s give us the strength to overcome the s\n[4065.2s] in Jesus name. Amen."

        "full_transcript": "discuss a topic called reduction and first time we saw that in the year 1961 when the national conference was being organized one of the things that was supposed to strengthen organization was that we need to empowered and still trying to realize and many there was a question that was raised that can baptize and build an insult I want to share before such words coming. audience because it means that it means that we should go and relax once more that are still connected with the institutions of This will come back and begin the church not maybe but May 21st, 3 BC, May 21st, 1889, 24. I wish to give some final text on the duties of deon. The servant is deities. build the servant of the church. These were first of all the seven are not plainly called but they were 53 53 but they were they were the first the first ever the contest showing that they was selected to the details of the church works temporal affair to relieve the elders. The root of the Greek word means signify dusty by running so that he gets covered by he of baptism he looks after the poor and take charge of the poor parts but he does not baptize that being a part of the duty of our minister. And that duty has not been given for a labor as a child. It is custom for the elder to have church. But in handing out the headlights the deacons assist as in the ordinance of the maybe the deacon can assistance he can do that but has not been given duty to administer any ordinance are you that number two I'm trying to answer the question is What? Yes. Thank you for that. Can you scroll? Then you make one another. This one I guess is okay. So you can do that you can let me say and this is an issue of God but I want you to understand without feeling access and do you understand that by virtue of his office as a deacon in the bridge only was an evangelist before or after he was chosen deacon. If by virtue of this deaconship he preach and baptize is here another example where the duties of the deon were not confined exclusively to the matters of the church also this question after to the prison. It means that Phil was also named a violist but has not been too much to anyone who has not that you have to be much in glory and worship before God's stand before their children may decree and pray in Jesus name I so much time and Christian But I may not read much but if you are against you I'm going investigate much I'm not going to be because I only investigation about the involvement and We were giving him the baptiz. So we determined that there were three groups. There were one of the groups that in every time they continue setting the time that one group there were also another group of we and we had already diverging 4 and separated. So the question now comes that4 and valley and return to that comes to the place and went into the most holy place and there was a group which was they indeed the interpretation was correct. worship but not that they were disappointed and reaching back in the state law and this biograph a b you topic I want our problems after this appointment what happened to page 10 Yes. Number 10. Number 10. 1844. There was someone who was calling human right. That is now a little farmer. Who was you? He is the advocate of the advocate of the advocate of the screen. Yes. originally exos the path of righteous said that exo was the instrument who God used to reveal the reveal to the eyes by giving adventist the meaning of the cleansing of the sanctuary with beds and white he was one of the deep thinking student who developed the seven adventist faith a self sacrificing servant of god an ardent evangelist and and faithful of all his long life in his devotion to Christ. He was at that time a mealist. Preacher. He was a meist. Let me continue. Early on the morning following October 22nd disappointment, Edson said to the few friends who may remain in his house, let us go out to the bar and so now after that was a calling friend I Then they shut the door and speak for them about their minds. They asked him to not while they were in the daily witness of the spirit that the prayers were heard. But less than an hour later as Edson and his neighbor of the about midway on the field was stopped and with a hand upon his shoulder. He turned his face to the gray skies and then there seemed to open a view in the third heaven. He saw Christ as the great high priest going from the holy place of the sanctuary to the most holy spir. He took his friend and he went to pray and after he disc how many heavens open and I saw that instead of our high priest coming out of the book to his side of him to come to this earth on the second month at the end of the days he for the first time enter that second of the sanctuary and that he want to perform in the most holy place coming to this earth so it Christ4 rising from place to death. Most knowing this, it continued his companion. He reached the other side of the field and the fence returned and he called, \"Brother Hson, what are you stopping for?\" Edson replied, \"The Lord was answering our morning prayer.\" Then rejoicing his friend, he told him of the vision. They went on their way discussing the chapter, recalling one study they had made for the sanctuary and shaping up the Bible. Praise God. So now after4 we start our day but the event is where we start. So they try now to investigate that that is the problem they now must be established. So after what you see now 206 the paragraph is paragraph number four paragraph number one 26 1 SN 206 number the foundation of our many of our people do not realize how firmly the foundation of our faith has been laid. our faith. We do not understand the church. We do not understand the history of this church. That's why this our messed up and we have moved on that established. But when he said that how he said that my husband with this gives right this now how the violation of my husband right number two elder Joseph B number three it is called Stephan Pice who served in the ministerial and administrative work in the early days. Number three is father Andrews was Andrew. The father of J Andrews was called Andrew and the father of the father of Jus in the Edison and who were king noble and true after the passing time of 1844 start with the truth as foren please after the passing of 1844 Now comes Adventist who now want to know that he messed up and God now within us now everything is bringing up his vision that God has shown him and James is now clear and they compiled and made that this is what the Lord has shown So for us, we have no mind. It continued by saying, \"I met you with them and we studied and prayed ear honestly until we remain together until late at at night and sometimes through the entire night praying for the lion and studying the the word. Again and again this come to study the Bible in order that they might know it meaning and be prepared to teach it with power. But there comes a point where they come to the point that's saying we can do that. Their mind is now saying that the spirit talks. The spirit talks the Holy Spirit. Now their mind is lost a person. Then now God is taking right now and revealing to him. Let us really say the spirit of the Lord will come upon me. He will be taken off in a vision and a clear explanation of the passages we had been studying would be given me with the instruction as to how we were to labor and teach. Thus light was given that help us to understand the scripture in regard to Christ, his mission and his priesthood. A line of stone extending from that time to the time when he shall enter the city of God was plain to me and I gave to others the instruction that the Lord has given me. Praise God. There now comes the birth of the seven. They now try to investigate that when the seven day what happened in 1844 at that time from that time 1860 there was nothing but they were calling theelves. So from that time now you are finding the parameters the founders of the seventh day because we are made on both sities are made with sanctuary and are made of combining the name to make this strong and forward in the book 1 284 the paragraph is paragraph number one. You see the three things that are going to make this one by 284 paragraph number one. Three things that is going to boil down 3 minutes 1 by 2 84 the paragraph is paragraph number one. You see what this means to call the adventist and what has made us what we are. I want you to read with me open very quick. You know this was founders of seven dynes. It says reading that three individuals three individuals stand out stand out as the founders of 7th day Adventist church. Praise God. They are the one that first God used to guide the sevenist church. Number one we have Joseph Bates. Number two we have James White. And number three we have Ellen W. These three individuals they are the ones who are standing that has made us what we are the foundation of their work. And I want you to mark this clearly. That's why in the last lesson we took our time to know the mite movement. Write with me. He said that the foundation of their work were laid in the great advent and his associate in first few years of 1844. 1840 is under the proclamation of the first and second of revelation 14. That is why that is where the foundation of this works. Then Joseph Bates retired sea captain become the apost you can write the career of Joseph Bates. Joseph B was a retired street captain and the one used to bring the children to this church which was known in the year 1845. Number two, we have a school teacher. James was a local school teacher. This was teaching. That is number two. And what was his ability with organization ability and clear perceptions? He has an organizing ability and clear perception. Number three, you are finding an anointing being with a gift of prophecy. An anointing be with a gift of prophecy. We were used by kind and molding the church. Praise God. this video. Why? Because I know on the other we look for the parity between the movement and also the Israelites. How many people did God use to the Israelites first? You know, Moses. Do you read the Bible? You know, Moses. When you read the book of Acts 5, I think it's 5:20 and the prophet s it means that for God to establish the church or God to establish that church in the wilderness, he had to bring up who is the providence as he brought what sister. Number two, who was being used to guide that church in the wilderness? It was Moses and for this church to be organized. It means that Moses must be available with James White. Number three was the work of doing the duties on the sanctuary and doing the duties of the work of God. He knew the group those three people God must use. That's why we finding the founders of this and for this gospel to go there must be about something. So what is the catalyst of this truth? What is going the review and held first appearing in April from the present room in 1849 and 1850. So the first president was established in the year 1849 and 1950 then developing into second review and er in the late 1815 was the catalyst. Praise the Lord. Some catalyst of reformation is publishing one which will not be one which will not be neglected in this church. We should not be neglected in this church. So we are the founders of this faith. Can you put for me apart books that are by teachers? Okay. Number one, the paragraph is paragraph number four. If your husband something very little, my time is going to be spent so much. Number four, you can write it. Number four which says that 8.5 someone can microphone I don't want to walk so much in 1845 in early 1845 was eventually understanding of the truth concerning the seventh day. at that point. So when did this child understand that that the Sabbath is the same 7th day 184 the respected captainsephected captain was the oldest member of our church he was the oldest member of our church and he became the first He became the first seventh president of conference president of Michigan 1861 in the year 1861 61 conference was organized and who was the president Joseph this I have no time there will help you number two we have Another one. Yes. Guess what? Even apologies of this 24 just number one from this light. It is called the of of 1821 and died in 1881 with 61 only 2 days. He was born in 1821 and died in 1881. Capable executive. We have not known of executive executive missionary leader James Springer White missionary of James Spring and he was a powerful public evangelist. He was public evangelist. When he was not standing public evangelism, no one can be insane. He was thankful public and uh not only did he participated with not only that participated in 1844 Joseph Bates and Joseph Bates and other in 1843 he done after the separation read so quickly. My time is really spent. The word applies to James and to other minister as to other minister minister. He was the publisher. He was the publisher of the first issue. Yes. President called President was established in 1849. It was established in 1850. structure. It was established in the 1850s sometimes. It was established in the year 18. He could have been the first president of the general congress. James could have been the first president of the general mark. James could have been the president of what but he declined the honor offered to him. He declared the honor offered to him by the brethren because he had been the chief advocate of the of church organization. When it's much time to present church organization, no one can get but president of the province by saying why did he did not he did not want people to think that he was making a joke. people to think that he was making a joke for he was president of the general conference. We will know that when we are talking about the presidents of the movement but he declined that I cannot be president because people may think that how organization it is because I want let us see what killed what someone who has been laboring for God can only die in 60 years. It is so painful. Why? Read that. However, however, between 1865 to 1863. Next, James White contribution to the church. James White contribution to the church. He was in the field. He was in the field of publishing work. Leadership. Leadership and administration. Yes. public association. It was he and his wife. Praise God. Go to my next 60 years. He he literally himself why he to such a state to such a state that it was difficult to persuade other men. It was difficult to persuade other men to the one thing he was qualified to do. people. He contin to do it so much but people fear that responsibility to manage. This tried to do this. He tried to do but was an interesting figure. Excellent. He was an interesting figure and excellent financial and manager and raptor and executive. He was executive committee. He was doing public evangelism. He was only he was also manating finance. He was old publishing house. He was only doing publishing outside. This man can live beyond 60 years with all those works. You are being told that was doing the work of 10 men. One person doing the work of 10 men that was not even financing work in the in the organization. That's why he took his time. He's going to work in the field. He's feeding his family. is going to work in the house. He's going to pray the man the church on this side and this side opposition. It made them to die in an early age. May God help us that James White we have here James White's not James White but now we have a lot of James White be for death in the year. Praise God. want to live be ready for death in the years and you're going to die soon in years. But if you don't die soon, it means you are not one. Let me let us proceed. Let us proceed. Let us proceed. We mention James White and another person. I'm going to the next but let me know that was this year 18 1854 and 1822 years in 1822 1852 when he was only how many years 22 he was already to do what to baptize as you can jour You remember that Jolo he was painting the house painting houses during the week and preach to several companies on Sunday. Praise God. That was the occupation of Jing. He was spent in houses and he went to pre the gospel and that's been economy. You can interact with Jer. You were one of the historians of you can write one number that's why they have to go and have the what the history of systematic we then what we have to determine on Jubation and enter the work of what the work of highlighted end of to become known somewhat as an as as historian. Mhm. He was the one historians among the among the let us go to the third person you just do investigation Jerry Nos J and there's a book called F O I number three. Yes. H O R Id4 number three national number we told that Jianos who was a serious who talented for studying of logical thinking came and led him to consider a career in law and politics. number three that you pray now was a bright sound. Still, stious promising young man. He was a promising young man. Are you promising? Are you studious? Are you right? Let's listen. His uncle His uncle Charles his uncle Charles encouraged him in his uh ear vision. He was really encouraging him in his vision to enter politics. It was told that quantities and if the little truck had not interveneed possibly we might have lost to the halls of Congress. A great author. He was really a great author. How many books have we proceeded? Religious leader. He was a religious leader and a missionary. He was a missionary. He was the first to fly to Westport. Let us read. However, however, Edward Andrews Edward Andrews his father his father had accepted the teachings of William Miller in the early 1840s. He was accepted the teaching of William in the year 1840s. And the whole family and the whole family consisting of the parents of two boys consisting of parent of two boys were numbered with the Adventist company in Paris and passed with them through their disappointment. Now with the uh now with the Stonewell family, now the Sto family, the uh Sepian Steing family and others, they accepted the seventh Sabbath, seventh day Sabbath. They accepted the seventh day Sabbath and were launched upon careers that took them far from politics ambition. Praise God. Amen. When you accept the Sabbath, you must leave politics. You must leave long education and you must leave career that are not according to the law of the law of God. Those are the darkers which you can take. We also have someone who is called but if we will find we talk on him. When you serve someone whom he loves when describing Stephan how is very clear distinctive in his word in his teaching you can you can go and inve spirit will not allow the one who might have something I'm only knew that she was who she was she was a prophet but we were little Verse 12, the words. This verse number six, verse two things, it reads it read so fast. And he said, And he said, \"Hear now my words, hear now my words. If there be a prophet among you, if there's a prophet among us, I the Lord will make myself known unto him vision. I myself will make myself known unto him in what? In a vision. In a vision. And will speak unto him in a dream. And I will speak unto him in what? A dream.\" So it means that because we read on the other day 13 and by a prophet the children of Israel were led from Egypt to the promised land and also by a prophet they were preserved. It also means that for sevenist for them to come from midnight cry to the heaven to heaven it means that they must possibly labage. Praise God. Because God knew that children cannot pass the middle of4 without them having a problem without them having the problem. But you have only4 but the children of the children of Israel could not have come out of Babylon without Egypt without prophet. It mean that also cannot pass down a prophet. So they come and now God is calling a prophet and that first prophet who the prophet of this was called William. You write that king. The first one who called and gave a mission is someone who is called William Among the 485. to 485 a prophet among you. There's someone who is called William the first called number one. William Eoy. William Eoy, a member of the Freeville Baptist Church. He was a member of the Freeville Baptist Church who was preparing for the ministry. He was preparing for the ministry. Was given to vision in Boston in 1842. He was given vision in the year 1842. It means that before the before is passing the midnight pl mean that God had to give them what a prophet. Praise God. Amen. He was given a vision in the year 1844 passing what? 1842. One January 18. One January 18 and the other on February 4. The another on February 43. In the first of this revelation in the first of this revelation for he viewed the glorious reward of the faithful. He will review the glorious reward of the painful and the uh punishment of sinners. He will review also the punishment of the sinners. Not being instructed not being instructed to relate to others what was shown him to relate to others what was shown him. He told no one of his vision. He told no one of that vision. But he had no peace of mind. He had no peace of mind. In the second revelation, in the second revelation, he witnessed the multitudes on earth array before heaven's bar of judgment, a mighty angel with the silver trumpet. Yes. Uh in hand about to descend uh to earth by three steps. Yes. The books of record in heaven. Mhm. The coming of Christ. Yes. And the reward of the faithful. Yes. He was bidded. He was bidded. Thou must reveal those things which thou hast seen.

He was the first man who was given what? Given vision. He was the first man who was given vision. Can you continue? I want to take a point. Two days after this revelation. 2 days after this revelation, he was requested by the pastor of the uh Bloom Bloomfield Street Church in Boston to release this vision. Yes. Although he was a fluent speaker, Yes. he reluctantly complied. He reluctantly complied fearing that the general prejudice against vision. Yes. And the fact that he was Yes. will make his work difficult. You can read what happened. But God did not use what? God did not heal. But not saying that God has made another person who call has a false research advent movement the 182 paragraph Number one is the second person is using that after the death of William now he's choosing someone who calls for a very young man to do the work and GSM GSM 182 182 yes 182 about this time about this time there lived in Poland that is after the passing of Poland made a young man by the name of this going to deny you and what is going to be a barrier to you to do the duty of God as present to you. Three who firmly believe the Lord will come on the 10th day of the seventh month. He believed that God will come in 1844. He was a man of fine appearance. First he was a man. He was a man of fine appearance. Pleasing address. He he had pleasing address and quite well educated. He was quite what? Educated. Do did he did he hasated? Yes. Yes, he was like them that sitting before me. A few weeks before me and Christ a few weeks before midnight cry ended. The Lord came near and gave him a vision and gave him a vision in which he will show the journey of the admit people to the city of God. She will show the journey of the people to the city of God. with the angels messages of warning were given to him. Some messages of war were given to him which he was to deliver which he was to deliver to the people and he had also a view of the trials and persecution. He also viewed this point he also viewed the trials and persecution that will consequently follow if he was faithful in relating. It means that God showed him that if you are going to enter this coin you are going to be persecuted. what had what had been shown here he like Mr. Foy he like Mr. upon you whom we have read about shown three steps by which the people of God were to come fully upon the pathway yes to the holy city being a far a firm believer in being a firm believer in the Lord's coming in the Lord's coming in a few more days in a few more days as they s the the part of the vision relating to the three steps and to the pathway was to him unexplainable So we praying that he should be given a mission and how how the people of God have to travel to the holy city. I don't want to explain but that seemed to him explain that has been I have not been told to relate but what happened and being naturally of drug spirit he been naturally of spirit because of his well education he turned from the cross he turned from the cross. Yes. And refused to relate it. He refused to relate it. The vision was repeated the second time. Then the repeated the second time how also we God has been made to us but we are not doing the work that God has called us. Now the second time now that you might coins now being made. And in addition he was told that if he still refused to relate what he had been shown that if you still going to refuse the call that you have been given the burden will be taken from him. You are going the same is going to be taken from you and be given to one of the weakest of the Lord's children. It is going to be given to another one of the weakest one who will faithfully relate what God will reveal. He again refused. He again refused. Praise God. Amen. If you are going to delay the goal now it is going to be given to the or the weakest and after that now it was taken from we told that live up to the year 189 but he had no interest don't go and search it is in the he9 but he had no interest in religious things because You're going to refuse this God. You are not going to die soon, but you are going to have no interest in religious things. Praise God. You are going to have no but the holy city. Praise God. Amen. So now that God is giving the weak of the weakest now what vision the weak of the weakest now he's giving the vision God help us now God is to remain our mission now there is now we have an Amen. If anyone has any question I want to pray but anyone there's no question. We really thank you so much for having us indeed. If you not deciding for ourselves, we're going to take this gospel from us and to the weak of the pray that you give us strength to relate to what you have shown unto us. But only God will let the be done and live in us. We so pray that you let us all new lessons before us. But what thou allow me and allow us to read will glorify thy name. Let thy name be glorified in all things. I pray in Jesus name. Amen.",

I wish to give some final text on\n[168.6s] the duties of deon. The servant is\n[171.4s] deities.\n[173.1s] build the servant of the church. These\n[175.5s] were first of\n[177.6s] all the seven are not plainly called but\n[183.7s] they were\n[186.6s] 53\n[190.2s] 53 but they\n[192.9s] were they were the\n[196.6s] first the\n[199.2s] first ever the\n[202.0s] contest showing that they was selected\n[205.4s] to the details of the church works\n[207.8s] temporal affair to relieve the elders.\n[211.7s] The root of the Greek word\n[213.7s] means signify dusty by running\n[218.3s] so that he gets covered by\n[227.9s] he of baptism he looks after the poor\n[233.2s] and take charge of the poor parts but he\n[236.5s] does not baptize that being a part of\n[239.4s] the duty of our\n[246.9s] minister.\n[248.5s] And that\n[250.5s] duty has not been given for a\n[256.0s] labor\n[259.9s] as a child. It is custom for the elder\n[264.1s] to have church.\n[267.1s] But in handing out the headlights the\n[269.8s] deacons assist as in the ordinance of\n[272.8s] the maybe the deacon can\n[280.1s] assistance he can do that but has not\n[283.8s] been given duty to administer any\n[287.4s] ordinance are you\n[291.7s] that number two I'm trying to answer the\n[295.3s] question is\n[310.9s] What?\n[318.6s] Yes. Thank you for that. Can\n[324.0s] you\n[328.1s] scroll? Then you\n[330.7s] make\n[337.8s] one\n[349.0s] another. This one\n[351.6s] I\n[355.5s] guess is okay.\n[358.7s] So you can do that you\n[362.4s] can let me\n[366.6s] say and this is an\n[369.2s] issue of God but I want you to\n[372.9s] understand without\n[375.7s] feeling\n[381.2s] access\n[383.1s] and do you understand that by virtue of\n[386.2s] his office as a deacon in the bridge\n[389.3s] only was an evangelist before or after\n[393.1s] he was chosen deacon.\n[395.5s] If by virtue of this deaconship he\n[398.4s] preach and baptize is here another\n[402.0s] example where the duties of the deon\n[405.1s] were not confined exclusively to the\n[407.3s] matters of the church also this\n[420.8s] question after to\n[425.2s] the prison. It means\n[428.9s] that Phil was also named a violist\n[436.1s] but has not been too much to\n[454.6s] anyone who has not\n[468.6s] that you have to\n[471.6s] be\n[485.2s] much in glory and\n[489.2s] worship before God's stand before their\n[493.6s] children may decree and pray in Jesus\n[502.6s] name\n[506.1s] I so\n[508.7s] much\n[510.3s] time\n[511.9s] and Christian\n[515.0s] But I may not read much but if you are\n[518.2s] against\n[520.7s] you I'm going investigate much I'm not\n[524.4s] going to be because I\n[535.9s] only\n[540.4s] investigation about the involvement and\n[545.5s] We were giving him the\n[566.6s] baptiz. So we determined that there were\n[570.2s] three groups. There were one of the\n[572.5s] groups that in every time they continue\n[575.5s] setting the time that one group\n[582.3s] there were also another group\n[586.8s] of\n[590.0s] we and we\n[593.0s] had\n[596.8s] already diverging\n[601.8s] 4 and separated. So the question now\n[606.2s] comes\n[608.8s] that4\n[610.6s] and valley and return\n[613.7s] to that comes to the place and went into\n[619.0s] the most holy place and there was a\n[622.2s] group which\n[624.1s] was\n[626.4s] they indeed the interpretation was\n[629.1s] correct. worship but\n[632.5s] not\n[635.8s] that they were\n[640.2s] disappointed and reaching\n[655.7s] back in the state\n[658.9s] law and this\n[665.4s] biograph a b you topic I\n[671.3s] want our problems after this appointment\n[674.6s] what happened to page\n[680.9s] 10\n[682.4s] Yes. Number\n[686.2s] 10. Number\n[693.2s] 10.\n[695.0s] 1844. There was someone who was\n[698.2s] calling human right. That is\n[707.3s] now a little\n[710.0s] farmer. Who\n[714.1s] was you? He is the advocate of\n[720.0s] the advocate of\n[727.8s] the advocate of\n[731.2s] the\n[736.7s] screen. Yes.\n[741.0s] originally exos the path of righteous\n[745.0s] said that exo was the instrument who God\n[748.8s] used to reveal the reveal to the eyes by\n[752.6s] giving adventist the meaning of the\n[755.3s] cleansing of the sanctuary with beds and\n[758.8s] white he was one of the deep thinking\n[761.9s] student who developed the seven\n[764.3s] adventist faith a self sacrificing\n[767.2s] servant of god an ardent\n[769.8s] evangelist and and faithful of all his\n[773.3s] long life in his devotion to Christ. He\n[776.2s] was at that time a mealist.\n[779.7s] Preacher. He was a meist. Let me\n[782.2s] continue. Early on the morning following\n[785.0s] October 22nd disappointment, Edson said\n[788.3s] to the few friends who may remain in his\n[790.6s] house, let us go out to the bar\n[794.5s] and\n[796.4s] so\n[798.5s] now\n[803.6s] after that was\n[806.8s] a calling\n[811.1s] friend I\n[812.9s] Then\n[813.8s] they shut the door and speak\n[818.4s] for them about their minds. They asked\n[822.6s] him to not while they were in the\n[827.2s] daily witness of the spirit that the\n[829.8s] prayers were heard. But less than an\n[832.0s] hour later as Edson and\n[836.3s] his neighbor of\n[839.3s] the about midway on the\n[842.5s] field was\n[844.3s] stopped and with a hand upon his\n[846.8s] shoulder. He turned his face to the gray\n[850.2s] skies and then there seemed to open a\n[853.5s] view in the third heaven. He saw Christ\n[856.3s] as the great high priest going from the\n[859.2s] holy place of the sanctuary to the most\n[862.2s] holy spir.\n[867.7s] He took his friend and he went to pray\n[870.4s] and\n[876.8s] after he\n[890.3s] disc how many\n[893.4s] heavens\n[901.7s] open and I saw\n[904.3s] that instead of our high priest coming\n[907.5s] out of the book to his side of him to\n[911.0s] come to this earth on the second month\n[914.2s] at the end of the days he for the first\n[917.4s] time enter that second of the sanctuary\n[922.2s] and that he want to perform in the most\n[924.8s] holy\n[928.3s] place coming to this earth so it Christ4\n[935.0s] rising from place to death. Most knowing\n[938.4s] this, it\n[940.2s] continued his companion. He reached the\n[943.6s] other side of the field and the fence\n[945.9s] returned and he called, \"Brother Hson,\n[949.4s] what are you stopping for?\" Edson\n[951.8s] replied, \"The Lord was answering our\n[954.5s] morning prayer.\" Then rejoicing his\n[956.8s] friend, he told him of the vision. They\n[960.2s] went on their way discussing the\n[962.4s] chapter, recalling one study they had\n[966.6s] made for the sanctuary and shaping up\n[969.2s] the\n[970.9s] Bible. Praise God.\n[975.0s] So now\n[979.8s] after4 we\n[985.2s] start our\n[987.3s] day but the event is where we start. So\n[992.1s] they try now to\n[993.7s] investigate that that is the problem\n[998.6s] they\n[1000.9s] now must be established.\n[1005.2s] So\n[1007.3s] after\n[1010.4s] what you see\n[1021.7s] now\n[1024.0s] 206 the paragraph is paragraph number\n[1027.6s] four paragraph number\n[1033.3s] one 26 1\n[1036.8s] SN\n[1039.0s] 206\n[1044.8s] number the foundation of\n[1053.0s] our many of our people do not realize\n[1057.2s] how firmly the foundation of our faith\n[1060.7s] has been laid.\n[1064.6s] our faith. We do not understand the\n[1067.6s] church. We do not understand the history\n[1069.8s] of this church. That's why this our\n[1072.8s] messed up and we have moved on that\n[1076.6s] established. But\n[1078.9s] when he said\n[1087.0s] that\n[1088.7s] how he said that my husband with this\n[1092.0s] gives right this now how the violation\n[1096.0s] of my husband right number two elder\n[1100.6s] Joseph B number three it is called\n[1104.4s] Stephan Pice who served in the\n[1107.6s] ministerial and administrative work in\n[1110.2s] the early days. Number three is father\n[1113.3s] Andrews was Andrew. The father of J\n[1117.3s] Andrews was\n[1118.9s] called Andrew and the father of the\n[1124.2s] father of\n[1126.0s] Jus in the Edison\n[1129.2s] and who were king noble and\n[1134.7s] true after the passing time of 1844\n[1138.4s] start with the truth as\n[1140.8s] foren\n[1142.4s] please after the passing of 1844\n[1146.2s] Now\n[1147.3s] comes Adventist who now want to know\n[1150.2s] that he messed up\n[1152.8s] and God now within\n[1157.5s] us now everything is bringing up his\n[1160.8s] vision that God has shown him and James\n[1164.6s] is now\n[1169.5s] clear and they compiled and made that\n[1172.6s] this is what the Lord has shown\n[1175.8s] So for us, we\n[1178.4s] have no mind. It continued by saying, \"I\n[1182.8s] met you with them and we studied and\n[1185.4s] prayed ear honestly until we remain\n[1188.1s] together until late at\n[1201.1s] at night and sometimes through the\n[1203.4s] entire night praying for the lion and\n[1205.8s] studying the the word. Again and again\n[1209.8s] this come to study the Bible in order\n[1213.4s] that they might know it meaning and be\n[1216.2s] prepared to teach it with power. But\n[1219.3s] there comes a point where they come to\n[1221.5s] the point that's saying we can do that.\n[1225.8s] Their mind is\n[1229.1s] now saying that the spirit\n[1232.4s] talks. The spirit\n[1234.6s] talks the Holy Spirit. Now their mind is\n[1238.2s] lost a\n[1240.0s] person. Then now God\n[1243.4s] is taking right now and revealing to\n[1247.1s] him. Let us really say the spirit of the\n[1249.7s] Lord will come upon me. He will be taken\n[1252.6s] off in a vision and a clear explanation\n[1255.5s] of the passages we had been studying\n[1258.6s] would be given me with the instruction\n[1261.1s] as to how we were to labor and teach.\n[1265.0s] Thus light was given that help us to\n[1268.2s] understand the scripture in regard to\n[1270.0s] Christ, his mission and his priesthood.\n[1273.7s] A line of stone extending from that time\n[1276.8s] to the time when he shall enter the city\n[1278.9s] of God was plain to me and I gave to\n[1282.1s] others the instruction that the Lord has\n[1284.9s] given me. Praise God. There now comes\n[1288.2s] the birth of the seven. They now try to\n[1291.6s] investigate that when the seven day what\n[1295.5s] happened in\n[1299.0s] 1844 at that time from that time 1860\n[1303.2s] there was\n[1304.4s] nothing but they were calling\n[1309.2s] theelves. So from that time now you are\n[1312.2s] finding the parameters the founders of\n[1314.5s] the seventh\n[1318.2s] day because we are made on both sities\n[1323.0s] are made\n[1324.9s] with sanctuary and are made of combining\n[1328.3s] the name to\n[1330.5s] make\n[1333.9s] this strong and\n[1337.2s] forward in the book 1 284 the paragraph\n[1341.5s] is paragraph number one. You see the\n[1344.3s] three things that are going to make this\n[1347.2s] one by\n[1349.0s] 284 paragraph number one. Three things\n[1352.8s] that is going to boil down 3 minutes 1\n[1357.4s] by 2 84 the paragraph is paragraph\n[1361.3s] number one. You see what this means to\n[1363.8s] call the adventist and what has made us\n[1367.7s] what we are. I want you to read with me\n[1370.8s] open very\n[1373.8s] quick. You know this was founders of\n[1376.6s] seven dynes. It says reading that three\n[1382.5s] individuals three individuals stand out\n[1387.0s] stand out as the founders of 7th day\n[1390.6s] Adventist church. Praise God. They are\n[1394.4s] the one that first God used to guide the\n[1398.4s] sevenist church. Number one we have\n[1401.1s] Joseph\n[1402.4s] Bates. Number two we have James White.\n[1405.7s] And number three we have Ellen W. These\n[1409.1s] three individuals they are the ones who\n[1411.0s] are standing that has made us what we\n[1413.9s] are the foundation of their work. And I\n[1416.8s] want you to mark this clearly. That's\n[1418.8s] why in the last lesson we took our time\n[1420.7s] to know the mite movement. Write with\n[1424.1s] me. He said that the foundation of their\n[1426.7s] work were laid in the great\n[1431.9s] advent and his associate in first few\n[1435.8s] years of\n[1437.6s] 1844. 1840 is under the proclamation of\n[1440.5s] the first and second of revelation 14.\n[1444.8s] That is why that is where the foundation\n[1447.2s] of this works.\n[1451.2s] Then Joseph Bates retired sea captain\n[1455.2s] become the\n[1457.2s] apost you can write the career of Joseph\n[1460.5s] Bates. Joseph B was a retired street\n[1464.0s] captain and the one used to bring the\n[1467.9s] children to this church which was known\n[1470.7s] in the year 1845.\n[1474.2s] Number two, we have a school\n[1478.0s] teacher. James was a local school\n[1481.5s] teacher. This was\n[1484.1s] teaching. That is number two. And what\n[1487.4s] was his ability with organization\n[1490.4s] ability and clear\n[1493.1s] perceptions? He has an organizing\n[1495.7s] ability and clear perception. Number\n[1497.8s] three, you are finding an anointing\n[1500.2s] being with a gift of\n[1503.1s] prophecy. An anointing be with a gift of\n[1507.9s] prophecy. We were used by kind and\n[1512.2s] molding\n[1513.6s] the church. Praise God. this video. Why?\n[1518.8s] Because I know on the other we look for\n[1521.4s] the parity between the movement and also\n[1525.2s] the\n[1526.3s] Israelites. How many people did God use\n[1529.0s] to the\n[1530.7s] Israelites first? You\n[1533.6s] know,\n[1537.5s] Moses. Do you read the Bible? You know,\n[1540.6s] Moses.\n[1542.9s] When you read the book of Acts 5, I\n[1544.8s] think it's\n[1546.1s] 5:20 and the prophet s it means that for\n[1551.8s] God to establish the church or God to\n[1554.3s] establish that church in the wilderness,\n[1556.2s] he had to bring up who is the providence\n[1559.0s] as he brought\n[1560.4s] what sister. Number two, who was being\n[1564.2s] used to guide that church in the\n[1566.3s] wilderness? It was Moses and for this\n[1569.2s] church to be organized. It means that\n[1571.4s] Moses must be available with James\n[1574.6s] White. Number three was the work\n[1578.3s] of doing the duties on the sanctuary\n[1583.5s] and doing the duties of the work of God.\n[1586.9s] He knew the\n[1589.8s] group those three people God must use.\n[1593.1s] That's why we finding the founders of\n[1594.9s] this and for this gospel to go there\n[1598.4s] must\n[1601.6s] be about\n[1618.2s] something. So what is the catalyst of\n[1620.6s] this truth?\n[1622.4s] What\n[1625.6s] is\n[1630.1s] going the review and held first\n[1633.5s] appearing in April from the present room\n[1637.4s] in 1849 and\n[1640.2s] 1850. So the\n[1642.3s] first president was established in the\n[1645.4s] year 1849 and\n[1647.6s] 1950 then developing into second review\n[1652.2s] and er in the late 1815 was the\n[1656.8s] catalyst. Praise the Lord. Some catalyst\n[1659.8s] of reformation is publishing one which\n[1662.8s] will not be one which will not be\n[1665.6s] neglected in this\n[1668.0s] church. We should not be neglected in\n[1670.6s] this church. So we are the founders of\n[1674.0s] this faith.\n[1676.1s] Can you put for me\n[1678.7s] apart books that are by\n[1682.3s] teachers? Okay. Number one, the\n[1685.0s] paragraph is paragraph number four. If\n[1687.9s] your\n[1689.7s] husband something very little, my time\n[1692.6s] is going to be spent so\n[1695.9s] much. Number four, you can write\n[1702.1s] it. Number\n[1711.8s] four which says that\n[1719.8s] 8.5 someone can microphone I don't want\n[1722.5s] to walk so\n[1725.9s] much in\n[1729.2s] 1845 in early 1845\n[1734.7s] was\n[1736.6s] eventually understanding of the truth\n[1739.6s] concerning the seventh day. at that\n[1742.5s] point. So when did this child understand\n[1745.4s] that that the Sabbath is the same 7th\n[1748.4s] day\n[1756.3s] 184 the respected\n[1761.7s] captainsephected captain was the oldest\n[1764.6s] member of our church he was the oldest\n[1768.0s] member of our church and he became the\n[1771.0s] first\n[1773.0s] He became the first seventh president of\n[1777.9s] conference president of Michigan\n[1781.4s] 1861 in the year\n[1784.3s] 1861 61 conference was organized and who\n[1789.8s] was the\n[1791.8s] president Joseph this I have no time\n[1796.2s] there will help you number two we have\n[1799.7s] Another\n[1800.8s] one. Yes. Guess what? Even\n[1816.7s] apologies of\n[1819.2s] this 24 just number\n[1824.4s] one from this light. It is\n[1828.9s] called the\n[1836.1s] of\n[1841.0s] of\n[1842.5s] 1821 and died in 1881 with\n[1847.4s] 61 only 2 days. He was born in 1821 and\n[1853.8s] died in 1881.\n[1865.1s] Capable executive. We have not known of\n[1871.9s] executive executive missionary leader\n[1875.2s] James Springer White missionary of James\n[1879.4s] Spring\n[1881.6s] and he was a powerful public evangelist.\n[1885.7s] He was public evangelist. When he was\n[1889.4s] not standing public evangelism, no one\n[1892.0s] can be insane. He was thankful public\n[1897.0s] and uh not only did he participated with\n[1903.3s] not only that participated in 1844\n[1906.6s] Joseph Bates and Joseph Bates and\n[1914.0s] other in\n[1917.0s] 1843 he\n[1921.0s] done after the separation\n[1934.1s] read so quickly. My time is really\n[1937.2s] spent. The word applies to James and to\n[1941.8s] other minister as to other minister\n[1945.0s] minister.\n[1948.6s] He was the publisher. He was the\n[1950.2s] publisher of the\n[1952.1s] first issue.\n[1956.0s] Yes.\n[1957.6s] President called President was\n[1959.5s] established in 1849.\n[1965.6s] It was established in 1850.\n[1968.3s] structure. It was established in the\n[1973.2s] 1850s\n[1974.9s] sometimes. It was established in the\n[1977.0s] year 18.\n[1980.1s] He could have been the first president\n[1981.9s] of the general congress. James could\n[1984.2s] have been the first president of the\n[1986.0s] general\n[1987.7s] mark. James could have been the\n[1990.3s] president of what\n[1992.8s] but he declined the honor offered to\n[1994.9s] him. He declared the honor offered to\n[1997.3s] him by the brethren because he had been\n[2000.7s] the chief advocate of the of church\n[2003.0s] organization. When it's much time to\n[2005.3s] present church organization, no one can\n[2009.4s] get\n[2012.5s] but president of the province by\n[2016.0s] saying why did he did not he did not\n[2021.4s] want people to think that he was making\n[2023.8s] a joke.\n[2025.5s] people to think that he was making a\n[2027.2s] joke for\n[2029.0s] he was president of the general\n[2031.1s] conference. We will know that when we\n[2033.2s] are talking about the presidents of the\n[2035.3s] movement but he declined that I cannot\n[2038.4s] be president because people may think\n[2040.0s] that how organization it is because I\n[2044.8s] want let us see what killed\n[2048.5s] what someone who has been laboring for\n[2051.0s] God can only die in 60 years. It is so\n[2054.1s] painful. Why? Read that. However,\n[2056.8s] however, between 1865 to 1863. Next,\n[2061.6s] James White contribution to the church.\n[2063.7s] James White contribution to the church.\n[2065.4s] He was in the field.\n[2068.1s] He was in the field of publishing work.\n[2071.6s] Leadership.\n[2073.4s] Leadership and administration.\n[2078.4s] Yes.\n[2080.0s] public association.

It\n[2140.5s] was difficult to persuade other men to\n[2142.9s] the one thing he was qualified to do.\n[2165.7s] people. He\n[2188.8s] contin to do it so much but people fear\n[2192.7s] that\n[2195.1s] responsibility to manage.\n[2197.0s] This tried to do this. He tried to do\n[2199.6s] but was an interesting figure.\n[2202.8s] Excellent. He was an interesting figure\n[2206.4s] and excellent financial and manager and\n[2211.6s] raptor and\n[2215.2s] executive. He was executive committee.\n[2218.9s] He was doing public evangelism.

This man can live beyond 60\n[2236.6s] years with all those works. You are\n[2239.0s] being told that was doing the work of 10\n[2241.9s] men. One person doing the work of 10 men\n[2245.6s] that was not even financing work in the\n[2248.7s] in the organization. That's why he took\n[2250.5s] his time.

May God help us that James\n[2270.4s] White we have here James White's not\n[2273.9s] James White but now we have a lot of\n[2275.7s] James White be for death in the year.\n[2278.6s] Praise God. want to live be ready for\n[2282.2s] death in the years and you're going to\n[2283.8s] die soon in years.

We mention James White\n[2303.5s] and another\n[2305.8s] person. I'm going to the next but let\n[2312.0s] me know that was this year\n[2317.5s] 18 1854 and\n[2321.0s] 1822 years in\n[2324.6s] 1822 1852 when he was only how many\n[2327.7s] years 22 he was already to do what to\n[2331.4s] baptize as you\n[2334.0s] can jour\n[2336.5s] You remember that\n[2338.0s] Jolo he was painting the house painting\n[2342.4s] houses during the week and preach to\n[2346.4s] several companies on Sunday. Praise God.\n[2350.6s] That was the occupation of\n[2355.9s] Jing. He was spent in houses and he went\n[2360.7s] to pre the gospel and that's been\n[2363.7s] economy. You can interact with Jer. You\n[2366.9s] were one of the historians\n[2369.7s] of you can write\n[2376.9s] one number that's\n[2382.5s] why they have to\n[2388.0s] go and have\n[2392.7s] the what the\n[2398.4s] history of\n[2401.9s] systematic we then what we have to\n[2405.2s] determine on\n[2413.2s] Jubation and enter the work of what the\n[2416.2s] work of highlighted\n[2422.1s] end of to become known somewhat as an as\n[2427.9s] as historian. Mhm.\n[2430.6s] He was the one historians among the\n[2434.8s] among the let us go to the third person\n[2439.0s] you just do investigation Jerry\n[2442.4s] Nos\n[2444.2s] J and there's a book called F O\n[2452.4s] I number\n[2456.3s] three. Yes. H O\n[2460.5s] R\n[2466.1s] Id4 number three\n[2475.1s] national\n[2477.2s] number we told that\n[2480.8s] Jianos who was a\n[2484.0s] serious who talented for studying of\n[2486.6s] logical thinking came and led him to\n[2489.0s] consider a career in law and politics.\n[2502.2s] number three\n[2505.6s] that you pray now\n[2525.8s] was a bright sound. Still, stious\n[2530.4s] promising young man. He was a promising\n[2533.0s] young man. Are you promising? Are you\n[2535.6s] studious? Are you right?\n[2538.9s] Let's listen. His uncle His uncle\n[2541.4s] Charles\n[2543.1s] his uncle Charles encouraged him in his\n[2546.3s] uh ear vision. He was really encouraging\n[2549.2s] him in his vision to enter politics. It\n[2552.1s] was told\n[2553.3s] that quantities and if the little truck\n[2557.2s] had not interveneed possibly we might\n[2561.4s] have lost to the halls of Congress. A\n[2564.7s] great author. He was really a great\n[2567.5s] author. How many books have\n[2569.6s] we proceeded? Religious leader. He was a\n[2572.8s] religious leader and a missionary. He\n[2575.0s] was a missionary. He was the first to\n[2577.2s] fly to Westport.\n[2581.0s] Let us read. However, however, Edward\n[2584.1s] Andrews Edward Andrews his father his\n[2586.7s] father had accepted the teachings of\n[2588.5s] William Miller in the early 1840s. He\n[2591.2s] was accepted the teaching of William in\n[2593.0s] the year 1840s. And the whole family and\n[2596.2s] the whole family consisting of the\n[2598.2s] parents of two boys consisting of parent\n[2600.9s] of two boys were numbered with the\n[2602.7s] Adventist company in Paris and passed\n[2607.3s] with them through their disappointment.\n[2610.6s] Now with the uh now with the Stonewell\n[2613.4s] family, now the Sto family, the uh\n[2617.2s] Sepian Steing family\n[2620.3s] and others, they accepted the seventh\n[2623.4s] Sabbath, seventh day Sabbath. They\n[2625.1s] accepted the seventh day Sabbath and\n[2627.2s] were launched upon careers that took\n[2630.2s] them far from politics ambition. Praise\n[2633.0s] God. Amen. When you accept the Sabbath,\n[2635.7s] you must leave politics. You must leave\n[2638.4s] long education and you must leave career\n[2641.1s] that are not according to the law of the\n[2643.8s] law of\n[2645.3s] God. Those are the darkers which you can\n[2649.6s] take. We also have someone who is\n[2657.7s] called but if we will find we talk on\n[2660.6s] him. When you serve someone whom he\n[2664.6s] loves when describing\n[2669.3s] Stephan how is very clear distinctive in\n[2672.4s] his word in his teaching you can you can\n[2675.1s] go and inve spirit will not\n[2678.1s] allow\n[2680.0s] the one\n[2681.8s] who might\n[2687.8s] have\n[2693.1s] something I'm\n[2697.5s] only knew that she was who she was she\n[2702.5s] was a prophet but we were little Verse\n[2706.4s] 12, the words. This verse number six,\n[2709.9s] verse two things, it reads it read so\n[2712.2s] fast. And he said, And he said, \"Hear\n[2714.7s] now my words, hear now my words. If\n[2716.8s] there be a prophet among you, if there's\n[2719.0s] a prophet among us, I the Lord will make\n[2722.3s] myself known unto him vision. I myself\n[2725.8s] will make myself known unto him in what?\n[2728.2s] In a vision. In a vision. And will speak\n[2730.4s] unto him in a dream. And I will speak\n[2733.0s] unto him in what? A dream.\" So it means\n[2735.4s] that because we read on the other\n[2739.2s] day 13 and by a prophet the children of\n[2743.6s] Israel were led from Egypt to the\n[2745.8s] promised land and also by a prophet they\n[2748.6s] were preserved. It also means that for\n[2752.0s] sevenist for them to come from midnight\n[2754.7s] cry to the heaven to heaven it means\n[2757.4s] that they must possibly\n[2761.1s] labage. Praise God. Because God knew\n[2765.4s] that children cannot pass the middle of4\n[2768.6s] without them having a\n[2771.6s] problem without them having the problem.\n[2775.1s] But you have\n[2783.0s] only4 but the children of the children\n[2786.6s] of Israel could not have come out of\n[2788.6s] Babylon without Egypt without prophet.\n[2791.4s] It mean that\n[2792.7s] also cannot pass down a prophet. So they\n[2797.7s] come and now God is calling a\n[2800.3s] prophet and that first prophet who the\n[2805.5s] prophet of this was called\n[2808.1s] William. You write that king. The first\n[2811.4s] one who called and gave a mission is\n[2813.8s] someone who is called\n[2820.4s] William\n[2822.8s] Among the 485.\n[2830.0s] to\n[2842.5s] 485 a prophet among\n[2845.6s] you. There's someone who is called\n[2848.9s] William the first\n[2852.4s] called number one.\n[2867.5s] William Eoy. William Eoy, a member of\n[2870.6s] the Freeville Baptist Church. He was a\n[2872.7s] member of the Freeville Baptist Church\n[2874.5s] who was preparing for the ministry. He\n[2877.1s] was preparing for the ministry. Was\n[2878.8s] given to vision in Boston in 1842. He\n[2882.6s] was given vision in the year 1842.\n[2886.0s] It means that before the before is\n[2888.7s] passing the midnight pl mean that God\n[2890.9s] had to give them what a prophet. Praise\n[2893.3s] God. Amen. He was given a vision in the\n[2895.3s] year 1844 passing what?\n[2898.7s] 1842. One January 18. One January 18 and\n[2903.3s] the other on February 4. The another on\n[2906.2s] February 43. In the first of this\n[2909.0s] revelation in the first of this\n[2910.6s] revelation for he viewed the glorious\n[2912.6s] reward of the faithful. He will review\n[2915.0s] the glorious reward of the painful and\n[2917.2s] the uh punishment of sinners. He will\n[2919.9s] review also the punishment of the\n[2921.5s] sinners. Not being instructed not being\n[2924.1s] instructed to relate to others what was\n[2926.6s] shown him to relate to others what was\n[2929.4s] shown him. He told no one of his vision.\n[2931.9s] He told no one of that vision. But he\n[2934.0s] had no peace of mind. He had no peace of\n[2936.7s] mind. In the second revelation, in the\n[2938.9s] second revelation, he witnessed the\n[2940.7s] multitudes on earth array before\n[2943.2s] heaven's bar of judgment, a mighty angel\n[2946.5s] with the silver trumpet. Yes. Uh in hand\n[2949.7s] about to descend uh to earth by three\n[2952.4s] steps. Yes. The books of record in\n[2955.1s] heaven. Mhm. The coming of Christ. Yes.\n[2958.2s] And the reward of the faithful. Yes. He\n[2960.6s] was bidded. He was bidded. Thou must\n[2962.9s] reveal those things which thou hast\n[2965.3s] seen. Thou must reveal those things\n[2967.7s] which thou hast seen and also what thy\n[2970.3s] fellow creatures and also thy fellow\n[2973.2s] creatures to flee from the wrath to God.\n[2976.2s] to flee from the wrath of\n[2978.2s] God. Praise God. Amen. He was the first\n[2981.0s] man who was given what? Given vision. He\n[2985.4s] was the first man who was given vision.\n[2987.8s] Can you continue? I want to take a\n[2989.7s] point. Two days after this revelation. 2\n[2992.4s] days after this revelation, he was\n[2994.4s] requested by the pastor of the uh Bloom\n[2997.7s] Bloomfield Street Church in Boston to\n[3000.4s] release this vision. Yes. Although he\n[3002.8s] was a fluent speaker, Yes. he\n[3005.4s] reluctantly complied. He reluctantly\n[3007.8s] complied fearing that the general\n[3010.1s] prejudice\n[3011.6s] against vision. Yes. And the fact that\n[3013.9s] he was\n[3016.7s] Yes. will make his work difficult.\n[3021.3s] You can read what happened. But God did\n[3024.7s] not use what? God did\n[3029.2s] not heal.\n[3035.0s] But not saying that God has made another\n[3038.0s] person who call has a\n[3041.5s] false\n[3060.9s] research advent movement the 182\n[3064.3s] paragraph Number one is the second\n[3066.3s] person is using\n[3069.9s] that after the death of William now he's\n[3073.8s] choosing someone who calls for a very\n[3076.9s] young man to do the work and\n[3082.0s] GSM GSM\n[3086.8s] 182\n[3088.3s] 182 yes\n[3096.3s] 182\n[3098.6s] about this time about this time there\n[3101.1s] lived in Poland that is after the\n[3103.4s] passing of Poland made a young man by\n[3107.8s] the name\n[3115.1s] of this going to deny you and what is\n[3119.4s] going to be a barrier to you to do the\n[3121.8s] duty of God as present to you.

She will show the journey\n[3174.4s] of the people to the city of God.\n[3177.8s] with the angels messages of warning were\n[3180.7s] given to him. Some messages of war were\n[3183.3s] given to him which he was to deliver\n[3185.8s] which he was to deliver to the people\n[3187.4s] and he had also a view of the trials and\n[3190.1s] persecution. He also viewed this point\n[3193.3s] he also viewed the trials and\n[3195.0s] persecution that will consequently\n[3197.6s] follow if he was faithful in relating.\n[3200.9s] It means that God showed him that if you\n[3202.7s] are going to enter this coin you are\n[3204.5s] going to be persecuted. what had what\n[3207.4s] had been shown here he like Mr. Foy he\n[3211.4s] like Mr. upon you whom we have read\n[3212.9s] about shown three steps by which the\n[3215.8s] people of God were to come fully upon\n[3218.6s] the pathway yes to the holy city being a\n[3222.2s] far a firm believer in being a firm\n[3225.0s] believer in the Lord's coming in the\n[3227.0s] Lord's coming in a few more days in a\n[3229.8s] few more days as they s the the part of\n[3235.8s] the vision relating to the three steps\n[3238.0s] and to the pathway was to him\n[3240.4s] unexplainable\n[3241.8s] So we praying that he should be given a\n[3243.7s] mission and how how the people of God\n[3246.3s] have to travel to the holy city.

and worship here so this is where the old SDS were so when I came back I had to go deep and start uh getting the e of the how the missionaries came to together because that is one of the how the third Angel's message came and because I'm connecting it with the true education I found it very nice in fact I took my time that that I had to go and do research so deep of how the missionary came to Kenya because we are also restoring the old foundations we also restoring the old foundations and as we do it we need to understand our what our history amen very important for us to understand our history so I want you to have it because Church Heritage is very important but I'm not going to go deep in the ones of the general that one you know I want now come to Kenya where we are so I wrote something very briefly so you can also take notes it is important so that even when no old man can can cheat you they can tell you you don't know anything because we not there but as we speak I don't think there which was born in 1906 we still alive there is none but even if there is there are very few and they not able to talk so we need also to know this history very important and I got the story of sth Adventist in K so you can put it this the story or the history of sth Adventist Church in Kenya and uh I this is what I found which may be very important to you to note one there somebody called how I wish I had a chalkboard but I don't have so somebody May write this name wrong way the man who brought sth Adventist Kenya is called CasCal cascine is written as C b a r s car like a car car you know a car is being written so it is car then you add s then c a l e n CasCal or CasCal I don't know how it's being called l e nalen a Grandville Grandville those are the three names but again he had four names he was called CasCal Grandville just a a there's no hcal Grandville Grandville Grand I don't know this man was the first Seventh Adventist in Kenya now he was born in [Music] 1879 before the preaching of right by faith he was born in 1879 in Canada his father was George Edward who was born in 18 44 his father was George Edward born in 1844 and the mother was called mother was called Odin Phillips othering Phillips born o r d l i n Phillips o r d [Music] e order orderly Philips D so not so brother welcome we are talking about the church Heritage here and we talking about the story of the Seventh Adventist Church in Kenya so we when we have just started and the man who brought the Seventh Adventist Kenya is called CasCal Arthur ARA Granville he was the first Seventh Day Adventist in Kenya his father was he was born in 1879 in Canada father was called George Edward born in 1844 and mother order in Philips 1847 the mother was born in 1847 he grew in USA he grew in USA United States of America baptism baptism baptism how CasCal was baptized baptism he was baptized in North Dakota with his parents with his parents his brother amamos and sister Mary in 1899 baptized in North Dakota with his parents his brother Amos and Sister Mary in 1899 now I want to ask you simple mathematics when was born in 1879 and he was baptized in 1899 how many years was he when he was baptized huh years he was baptized into one true God of the faith of the Seventh Day Adventist by that time uh sister is Mary sister is just Mary baptized in 1899 something which you need to note about casalin that as a young man he worked with his father who taught him many skills including as a young man he worked with his father who taught him many skills you remember we are going to learn true education and this this one really touched me his father taught him many things many skills including carpentry farming and metal work carpentry farming and metal work so that is what the father of casalin taught him you may ask about his quing formal education so right that formal school for Arthur ended when he was 10 years foral school for other ended when he was 10 years and he became a farmer a carpenter and a blacksmith his formal School ended when he was 10 thereby he became a farmer a carpenter and a blacksmith so he had three professors a farmer a carpenter and what black so that was the education when at 10 education had ended I don't know how that one you will not ask me that one for now let let's continue um although he loved he loved his father spread because the his father stade was what father taught him carpentry blacksmith those others he really loved his father stade he was also a vivid reader and that ambition to become a teacher he was a vivid reader and ambition to become a what a teacher so he wanted to become a teacher however much he loved his father the father taught him through fing and blacksmith but in his he had ambition become a what a teacher become a teacher thus he attended Union College from 1901 to 1902 he attended Union College from 1901 to 1902 1901 to 1902 he attended a Union College so somebody can go to college having done this those ones he went to college don't ask me do people go to college when they have only learned blacksmith don't ask me that one for now you will ask later in 1901 to 1902 now there's something which took place in the life of caline there's something here which also you need to not having attended Union College from 1901 to 1902 there's another point he was a brilliant student that he complet completed a 2E course in one year he was a brilliant student that completed a 2 year course in one one year year a twoe course he completed in one year in 1904 he entered another College where he completed his course in September 1906 in 1904 he entered another College training by completed his course in September 1906 1906 hope you know that 1906 is when SD began in Kenya so this so we are now entering in serious important uh life of him Ministry and marriage you can write that Ministry and marriage I was reading on how CasCal married and it was so I don't know it was so sweet Ministry and marriage Ministry and marriage in 1902 [Music] CasCal was recruited by General Conference president in 1902 CasCal was recruited by the general conference president a Daniels I hope you know that during that time the President of General Conference was called a Daniels AG Daniels AG Daniels in 1902 CasCal was recruited by General Conference president a G Danel to help 12 help strengthen the young Adventist Church in [Music] Britain to help young Adventist Church in Britain to help young Adventist Church in Britain so by 1902 how many years it was now 20 1902 it was if 1899 it was 20 then 1902 was 20 20 23 years so he was given a church a young Adventist Church in Britain especially as aort evangelis to dop evangelism cport evangelism and he was also to do that cport evangelism in Scotland W Scotland Wales and England so he was taking care of that young Adventist Church and he was also do called evangelism in Wales and in what Scotland and England now there was another interesting topic that he did not do he he did not did the conversing but also assisted in Evangelistic meetings we also not only doing that work but he's also assisting in Evangelistic meetings and camp meetings so he was a speaker in Evangelistic what meetings and also in camp meetings uh so there was a good point here this is a good point listen to it young men and women and all of us and myself yes this is the point I'm reading in one such meeting when they were in one of the meetings of one of the Evangelistic meetings come meeting there was a young lady there was what young lady there was a young lady called la Bruce Thomson Ellen Bruce Thomson one such meeting there was a young lady Helen Bruce Thompson who was a volunteer pianist Helen Bruce Thomson Helen Bruce THS [Music] pianist from GL why are you not writing this thing very important the next convention you be one will be teaching us the Adventist history K very important Glo is from Glo Glo Church spelling is g l o s g o Wu g l o s g o w GL go church and AR is CasCal remember CasCal is called CasCal AR so sometimes when I use the word AR you know it is CasCal AR it wasal grandv so this this young lady Bruce Thomson a volunteer fromo church and AR found himself concentrating more on the music than the Sal Moon Arthur found himself concentrating more on the music than the what than the salon than the salon so when Helen was playing piano CasCal now loved what music than the what so what that is what you want to look at later later now the word later means not not that year the word later not be 1902 so that we see later anden became hband so lat lat so was concentrating on music on so lat later you want to see that was later so you want to look at later I those who are just coming in we are talking about the history of the Seventh Adventist in Kenya so because you are late you will copy notes that man walking will he get this notes these notes are very important this history let nobody take them like me I wanted to only see listen to Fai amen also very salvation amen yes you don't have a pen is saying he doesn't have a pen so I don't know you can check this bag if you can get one I don't know I don't think you can get who has got two P just go and buy now another Point upon realizing CasCal extraordinary potential upon realizing calin's extraordinary potential and with support of Lis Richard upon realizing CasCal extraordinary potential upon realizing CasCal extraordinary potential and with support of Lis Richard with the support of Lois Richard Louise Richard conr conr upon realizing CasCal extraordinary potential and with support of Lis Richard Conrad the European division president the European division president which at that time included European countries which at that time included European countries comma the British Union European countries Comm and then you write the British Union voted to ordain him as a minister the British Union voted to him as a minister the British Union voted to as a what a minister he was ordained in England in 1906 he was ordained in England in 1906 he was ordained in England in 1906 at the time of completion of his Course in New College at the time of completion of his Course in New bold college at the time of completion of his Course in New College New College a new B College poop it was 27 years he was 27 years of age you can also ending you can that was officiated by Elma Elis Elma e l m e r Elis wat Elma Elis wat Brit British Union president Elma El wat wat this thing wat this so El wat is one name Elma Elis British Union president the oration was officed by Elma Elis British Union president and assisted by abber [Music] e r b e r t habat Hab cden how about cden who was the principal elect of the stand stur College who was the principal elect of the stand Boro colle so that one took place in 1906 now after that now the work of caline began after CasCal oration it was It was decided to send him as a missionary to British East Africa in bracket Kenya I believe those who have gone to school you understand British Africa how they divided and for you to come somewhere you are only to go under where your people are so was to come with America because America not any and the were only to come following the British so if you are coming from Britain you are only to go where the British and you to go through the missionaries are they were working to together I hope you know that so that that is why it was very difficult for for people to go to Tanzania because were only Germans so for you to attend a missionary send it German protor there so he came to British after Calo it was decided to send him as a missionary to British East Africa British East Africa in bracket Kenya he came alone but request he was he came alone he came alone Remember by 1906 he had not married we wrot a point later they married so from 1902 to 1906 they're not married he was only interested in music but not in marri but remember when he was being sent he was sent to Kenya without a wife he came a what alone so that that is very powerful point he came alone but he requested that his fany Helen Thomson desent after a year he requested the conference the union MH he came alone but he requested that his fan Helen Thompson be sent yes now a I look at how I love how CasCal organized this thing in a nice way fact this story made look another point now another point at the same time conr asked Peter to go with him to help in African language conr who was the one who him was the president of you don't know let me continue yes so at the same time asked Peter to go with him to help in African language so you can write in bracket Mr Peter Peter he was called Peter nambo he was coming from Malawi nasand Malawi so was an African person he went to Britain to to study the Bible so he was told to bring CasCal because he was going to help in African what language so asked because are an African please kindly go with who language so Peter was not a an American not a Europe but he was he went there so he was they came all of them the two missionar sailed from Hamburg Germany on October 1st 1906 the two missionaries sailed from Hamburg Germany the two missionary s from H Germany on October 1st 1906 and to Mombasa the two missionary sailed from am Germany on October 1st 1906

present island of Tanga island of i s l a s is island island of Tanga Tanga is presently called tanzan are waiting for them waiting for them another point the three left Tanga and arrived in Mombasa on November 27y October to November 27 you mean this remember when they left coming November 27th is when they arrived in where in Mombasa 1906 27 the three left Tanga and arrived in Mombasa on November 27th 1906 will stop when the local missionary Society agent came across their names at the passengers list when the local missionary Society agent when the local missionary Society agent came across their names on the passengers List local missionary Society agent came across their names at the passengers list he went on board and greeted them as fellow Christians he went on board and greet treated them as fellow Christians remember there were missionary Society in Kenya before angan came to Kenya before Adventist you aware about that even PCA arrived in 1903 1901 there are several churches Catholic had already arrived and they were all calling themselves what Christian you will they welcomed him as their fellow Christians so he went this Miss soci agent in Mombasa went and greeted the M Christians Kenya now from Mombasa from Mombasa they traveled about 960 kilom I didn't go there going to Nairobi and the rest so I just got this kilm 960 kilm by Railway the railway was

they traveled about 960 km 960 km by Railway to weam Gulf in the North Eastern Corner Lake Victoria Southwestern Kenya I'm going to leave other things but I I want to choose this they pitched the tent at oang and later to Gia they preach their tent ATO and later to Gia that became the first mission station in Kenya there are many stories left you will go and sech spelling ofo o g a n [Music] g and later to G we that became the first mission station in Kenya now look at this interesting point in 1907 in 1907 second team was dispatched to join CasCal second team was dispatched to join CasCal second team was dispatched from the same Union to join caline and this person who came in 1907 to John CasCal was called G Del Del J Del you just deler and his wife an and his wife an both of them

activities with his wife who was committed to the mission Arthur continued arur continued with church planting activities with his wife who was committed to the mission after continued with church planting activities this is what we were learning with the the the junior Youth and the seniors that for those who are willing to marry we need to pray much that you may get a lady that can be committed in Mission work by the way what made kasal to do a serious work here in Kenya is the woman that married imagine a lady who accept to come in a land where people walk naked with you you are going to get a point that L were walking naked and you you know people from do not know why coton what planting began there you don't know I want to read with you the L were walking and the lady came to join a man in the bush now amen amen so may God help the people are [Music] amen that was the life that is muu by the wayu coming [Music] M they bigs they had a tent [Music] am that is how the Miss began in ADV very bad [Music] mhm a the next point you uh he also realized that there were no books in D he also realized that there were no books in he mastered the language and translated some portions of the new testament which was published by the British Society he also realized that there were no books that were no books in he mastered the language mastered the words language and translated some persons on the new testament which was published in by the British Society British Bible Society so what did he do first he realized that that there were no books in he mastered the language and translated some persons in the New Testament which was published by the British Bible societies so the first language to be translated from English was what in that means will be a head of the word of God more than any other Tri they are the ones who are Jokers amen another one so he mastered and transl New Testament New Testament Matthew to Revelation was translated in L and later on is when they came and translated the old what Testament in 1908 b b m and JN Sparks BL M and JN Sparks joined the growing number of missionaries joined the the growing number of missionaries not and J Sparks joined the growing number of missionaries and G became the parent mission for several other Mission FES and G became the parent mission for seever for several other missions filed another Point JD Baker J founded you know who knows where we div to it was founded it was the first it was founded by called J founded out of G in 1909 was began in 1909 19 huh 1909 [Music] [Music] 19 in 1909 making this second in South and the of making it the second Adventist missions in South yanza and the rest of Kenya so after gya the next Vision was is the second one that is still in the South Nang another [Music] one Ellen was capable of s stress s stress what is going on just don't Len okay thank you enen was capable of sim stress s stress who is the seem stress that is s m s t r e s which a Sim Stress Check Your Dictionary who is a sess because Ellen was the wife of cascine was a sress check it yes nobody knows all phones are off but I think there's somebody with this phone check for us stress take the microphone to the one checking s stress yes give him the dictionary check in webst dictionary now as you checking Ellen was capable of s stress and our challenge was not lack of written language in Cav but lack of any clothing at all so the challenge of was she was a capable sress and that challenge was not even lack of written language in Cavo Cavo is the L but lack of any clothing at all so the L were walking naked around Lake Victoria with was a CL which the one you TI it here so when you see somebody coming in front of you so it was very difficult when one is coming in front and the other one behind I don't know how they were doing it so this was a challenge of this woman uh Ellen and um the ls were not in clothes the ls were not in cloes and Ellen learned to change the situation Ellen learned to change change the situation so apart from soliciting closed from the Homeland now the word apart from apart from soliciting clothes from our homeland meaning she was requesting for clothes to come from Scotland to Kenya to help the L to be clothed but they did not only wait to solicit clothing from our homeland to Kenya she rather became a useful cotton gr she became a useful cotton grower used to make clothes used to make clothes those who are coming around and is there you hear that there was Aon growing there we coming from here even ver you don't know you have never seen coton the coton which was grown in around was brought by Ellen Bruce Thompson now this coton was to help them to make clothes and this industry contributed to the effectiveness of the message this industry of coton growing to be used to make cloes contributed to the effectiveness of the message we able to do to ensure that the message reaches to everyone uh baptism the first baptism this is also interesting the first baptism baptism baptism baptism the first baptism and they write this powerful date on May 21st on May 21st 1911 on May 21st 1911 5 years later 5 years later of the arrival of the first missionaries 5 years later of the arrival of the first missionary is the baptism of 16 16 people was witnessed by B I don't know how we read this name b o b full stop o h m e how do we read can that H home B is it home I don't know there was 16 people by baptized which was witnessed by the be home the the superintendant of German East Africa the superintendent of German East Africa now some of the young men that were baptized were some of the young men that were baptized were I'm not going to read all the 16 but there were young men the first the people who accepted the Three Angels message when it came to again it was very difficult five years you are preaching nobody has accepted the message nobody so these people were only after 5 years now the young men that were baptized young men number one some of the young men that were baptized were number one Isa from gandia Village I'm how many knows the isa's place you know it Mama n know where is that was the first person to be baptized as a young man in 1911 died still alive died but the fam is the very rich family is the first young man to be baptized number two J from K maned number three from k k is inel from Ab from Kil and then the last one which I wrote the name I left the 12 names you can go and check Daniel onyango from kyang from those are the first four young men that used to preach the gospel if you go around go and ask the place go and ask if you come Toad go and ask a place called J among many others not talked about May I've not talked about the rest of the others those ones are also there and now following the first baptism and this young men were baptized listen to what took place following the that first baptism that was done in Lake Victoria next to gandia just there in the lake there following the first baptism the mission spread in Gia to their neighboring gy uh uh after this baptism great things happen the mission spread in Gia to their neighboring those young men that were baptized were also engaged in preaching and doing other things now new Mission stations you can write them as a result new Mission stations number one new Mission stations we in 1909 we9 19 10 to 1912 K 1912 n 1912 kambo 1912 1913 got 193 got ringa is in ringa Islands this were the new station that came as a result of the first baptism and the mission now spread powerfully and that is why if you go to the L land and K land most all of them most of them are Adventist the challenge is even the reforms are too much in in KY land and in in in L yes okay okay let me new Miss stations from my not 1910 to 1912 Nan 1912 kamu 1912 1913 kungu 1912 got ringa 1913 got R so those were the first mission stations it was in and the South alone in central Anglican had gone there and remember the British had said something that they did not want interfere with other missionaries so you are to go where another Christian Missionary has never entered because they were saying it is Big please find somewhere people have not gone to so that they may not be able to fight themselves they knew that if they do that Africans will not accept the what the gospel so they didn't want to fight among themselves that is what they were doing those times um to know thanks to not to not things to not this is very important for the missionaries here some people may think that there was money flowing from Europe or from America to this missionaries I found this one very important for us that from 1906 from 1906 when these missionaries arrived the first money the first money to arrive was 22,500 Sterling pound which arrived from the general conference it arrived from the general conference through Mombasa through Mombasa missionary Society it arrived 7 years after the missionaries had arrived that is the first money they received 2,500 Sterling pound and it came after 7 years you can ask yourself how was casalin eating how was coming to KY to open the Mission Station when the first money to be sent came after 7 years that is something to note that is something to be what noted that the money arrived after what 7 years from the general conference that is the Sterling pound 2500 that is something to be noted number two to be noted during World War One one many things were looted and damaged and workers except castaline and others were kept from the station nearly 2 years World War I was in 1914 World War one was in 1914 during that time the properties of were damage the things that the church had done were damaged and some workers had to be removed only CasCal were kept in the station in the British protectorate for 2 years without working as a result of World War I until America entered the war in 1917 which stopped the war because the War was between triple and Triple Alliance in 1921 in 1921 Calen returned to us in this he returned to the US so Calin was not buried in Gia he went back he was not buried here he went back to us and in the same year he went in the same year he returned his wife Ellen died in Oregon his wife Ellen died in Oregon and castaline remained without a wife I think it was around 58 years from 197 1879 to 1921 was how many years 1879 to 1921 it was how many years huh 40 19 1879 to 1921 42 he was 42 okay 42 years the wife died in 1924 pascaline married Anita jamen married an Johnson after the wife died she married that one is allowed she married a lady called Anita Jameson and uh meanwhile other missionaries arrived in gendia other missionaries arrived in gendia they included g g mad mad mad arrived in gendia WT bnet arrived in gendia but L and WW Armstrong also arrived in gandia in 1924 K Mission sanitarium was open which is currently called gandia oal now stolen by the government and the Purple powers and sanar was [Music] open as that one was taking place caline was sent to pastoral work in D in British from 1931 to 1942 where he became the president of the three fields in British final thing to note that Publishing House the small printing house was started in 1910 to 1914 by CasCal and finally CasCal in the east of the ls he wrote four 04 words of the L dictionary which was tered as L dictionary the diary was written by M4 Proverbs were written by him I left there from my church edit there a lot of things I skipped and that is the ad Heritage from there the gospel moved soan the gospel reached when elen white was still alive and that was the Gospel of the Three Angels message it was supported by the hand workk those two the reason why the money did not come from the general confence but the workers help themselves the wife started coton farming and that one was helping to use the clothes the young men that were baptized were helping in NW work in the morning and in the afternoon they were going to preach around to the fellow LS and as they were preaching coming and working with in the farm using their hands and also preaching using the hands they were sent to K here they were preaching and digging and hitting money came after seven good years and it was from the general conference by the Sterling pound 2 2,500 any question up to reached so that I get into Part B any question any addition that was the church Heritage the eory of the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Kenya before the apostasy yes Sur take a microphone yes ask uh my question is our Advent is allowed to marry a second wife after the DAT of the first wife repeat the question are sth Day Adventist allowed to marry the second wife after the death of the first the wife Mich answer yes answer what is the biblical does the bible allow someone to marry again after the death of the wife I think that was in the Bible is it which Corinthians is it first Genesis 25 verse1 we finding Abraham after the death of Sarah Abraham took another wife now according to the bial is allowed that after the first wife if you cannot Remain the way you are you are allowed to marry another wife even a woman is allowed even Paul

were telling us because we\n[18.2s] the old SDS you come and worship here so\n[21.7s] this is where the old SDS were so when I\n[24.4s] came back I had to go deep and start uh\n[29.2s] getting the e of the how the\n[31.4s] missionaries came to together because\n[33.0s] that is one of the how the third Angel's\n[35.5s] message came and because I'm connecting\n[38.2s] it with the true\n[39.6s] education I found it very nice in fact I\n[42.6s] took my time that that I had to go and\n[45.7s] do research so deep of how the\n[48.9s] missionary came to Kenya because we are\n[50.7s] also restoring the old\n[53.5s] foundations we also restoring the old\n[55.9s] foundations and as we do it we need to\n[58.9s] understand our what\n[61.8s] our history amen very important for us\n[65.4s]

you they can tell you you\n[90.8s] don't know anything because we not there\n[92.6s] but as we speak I don't think there\n[95.6s] which was born in 1906 we still\n[99.2s] alive there\n[101.2s] is none but even if there is there are\n[104.2s] very few and they not able to talk so we\n[106.8s] need also to know this history very\n[110.1s] important and I got the\n[113.0s] story of sth Adventist in K

about\n[303.6s] the church Heritage here and we talking\n[306.3s] about the story of the Seventh Adventist\n[308.2s] Church in\n[309.3s] Kenya so we when we have just started\n[313.4s] and the man who brought the Seventh\n[315.0s] Adventist Kenya is called CasCal Arthur\n[317.2s] ARA\n[318.8s] Granville he was the first Seventh Day\n[321.2s] Adventist in Kenya his father was he was\n[324.3s] born

USA United States of\n[344.9s] America\n[347.4s] baptism baptism baptism how CasCal was\n[353.4s] baptized\n[357.6s] baptism he was baptized in North Dakota\n[361.4s] with his\n[363.5s] parents with his\n[366.2s] parents his brother amamos and sister\n[369.6s] Mary in\n[372.6s] 1899 baptized in North Dakota with his\n[376.7s] parents his brother Amos and Sister Mary\n[380.8s] in\n[385.2s] 1899 now I want to ask you simple\n[388.3s] mathematics when was born in 1879 and he\n[391.9s] was baptized in 1899 how many years was\n[395.0s] he when he was\n[399.2s] baptized\n[401.6s] huh years he was baptized into one true\n[405.3s] God of the faith of the Seventh Day\n[406.9s] Adventist by that\n[409.4s] time\n[412.3s] uh sister is Mary sister is just\n[416.0s] Mary baptized in 1899\n[421.6s] something which you need to note about\n[423.2s] casalin that as a young man he worked\n[426.3s] with his father who taught him many\n[429.0s] skills\n[430.7s] including as a young man he worked with\n[433.2s] his father who taught him many skills\n[435.8s] you remember we are going to learn true\n[437.9s] education and this this one really\n[441.0s] touched\n[442.6s] me his father taught him many things\n[445.4s] many skills including\n[447.9s] carpentry farming and metal\n[450.8s] work\n[452.8s] carpentry\n[454.3s] farming and metal\n[456.6s] work so that is what the father of\n[459.2s] casalin taught\n[471.1s] him you may ask about his quing formal\n[474.8s] education so right that formal school\n[477.0s] for Arthur ended when he was 10\n[481.4s] years foral school for other ended when\n[484.1s] he was 10\n[486.7s] years and he became a farmer a carpenter\n[489.9s] and a\n[491.8s] blacksmith his formal School ended when\n[494.3s] he was\n[495.9s] 10 thereby he became a\n[500.3s] farmer a carpenter and a blacksmith so\n[503.8s] he had three professors a\n[506.9s] farmer a carpenter and what\n[513.3s] black so that was the education when at\n[518.8s] 10 education had ended I don't know how\n[522.2s] that one you will not ask me that one\n[525.0s] for now let let's\n[527.2s] continue\n[529.6s] um\n[531.5s] although he\n[533.9s] loved he\n[536.9s] loved his father spread because the his\n[540.0s] father stade was what father taught him\n[542.6s] carpentry blacksmith those others he\n[545.8s] really loved his father stade he was\n[548.4s] also a vivid reader and that ambition to\n[552.2s] become a teacher he was a vivid reader\n[556.1s] and ambition to become a what a teacher\n[560.5s] so he wanted to become a teacher however\n[563.2s] much he loved his father the father\n[565.3s] taught him through fing and blacksmith\n[568.0s] but in his he had ambition become a what\n[570.7s] a\n[571.5s] teacher become a\n[574.1s] teacher thus he attended Union College\n[577.4s] from 1901 to\n[579.5s] 1902 he attended Union College from 1901\n[584.0s] to\n[585.0s] 1902 1901 to\n[588.0s] 1902 he attended a Union\n[591.8s] College so somebody can go to college\n[594.4s] having done this those ones he went to\n[597.6s] college don't ask me do people go to\n[599.8s] college when they have only learned\n[603.2s] blacksmith don't ask me that one for now\n[605.8s] you will ask\n[607.2s] later in 1901 to\n[611.5s] 1902 now there's something which took\n[613.7s] place in the life of\n[616.0s] caline there's something here which also\n[618.7s] you need to\n[620.5s] not having attended Union College from\n[623.0s] 1901 to\n[624.8s] 1902 there's another point he was a\n[627.2s] brilliant student that he complet\n[629.3s] completed a 2E course in one\n[632.6s] year he was a brilliant student that\n[636.4s] completed a 2 year course in one one\n[639.0s] year year a twoe course he completed in\n[643.6s] one year\n[665.3s] in\n[669.1s] 1904 he entered another\n[673.1s] College where he completed his course in\n[675.5s] September\n[678.5s] 1906 in 1904 he entered another College\n[682.6s] training by completed his course in\n[685.0s] September\n[686.9s] 1906 1906 hope you know that 1906 is\n[691.1s] when SD began in Kenya so this so we are\n[693.4s] now entering in\n[694.9s] serious important\n[698.6s] uh life of him Ministry and marriage you\n[701.6s] can write that Ministry and marriage I\n[704.4s] was reading on how CasCal married and it\n[707.4s] was so I don't know it was so\n[711.1s] sweet Ministry and\n[713.4s] marriage Ministry and\n[716.4s] marriage in 1902\n[718.8s] [Music]\n[720.1s] CasCal was recruited by General\n[722.7s] Conference\n[723.9s] president in 1902 CasCal was recruited\n[728.3s] by the general conference president a\n[730.9s] Daniels I hope you know that during that\n[733.2s] time the President of General Conference\n[734.8s] was called a Daniels AG\n[738.5s] Daniels AG\n[742.4s] Daniels in 1902 CasCal was recruited by\n[746.2s] General Conference president a\n[751.3s] G\n[754.0s] Danel to\n[756.3s] help 12 help strengthen the young\n[759.0s] Adventist Church in\n[760.5s] [Music]\n[761.8s] Britain to help young Adventist Church\n[765.4s] in\n[768.6s] Britain to help young Adventist Church\n[771.4s] in\n[774.2s] Britain so by 1902 how many years it was\n[777.7s] now 20\n[782.5s] 1902 it was if 1899 it was 20 then 1902\n[788.2s] was\n[790.1s] 20 20 23 years so he was given a church\n[796.0s] a young Adventist Church in Britain\n[798.2s] especially as aort evangelis to dop\n[805.4s] evangelism cport evangelism\n[810.6s] and he was also to do that cport\n[812.3s] evangelism in\n[814.2s] Scotland W Scotland Wales and\n[820.6s] England so he was taking care of that\n[823.0s] young Adventist Church and he was also\n[825.1s] do called evangelism in Wales and in\n[829.0s] what Scotland and\n[834.3s] England now there was another\n[836.3s] interesting topic that he did not do he\n[838.5s] he did not did the conversing but also\n[841.2s] assisted in Evangelistic\n[844.3s] meetings we also not only doing that\n[847.5s] work but he's also assisting in\n[849.3s] Evangelistic\n[851.4s] meetings and camp\n[854.6s] meetings so he was a speaker in\n[857.2s] Evangelistic what meetings and also in\n[861.8s] camp\n[865.8s] meetings uh\n[873.1s] so there was a good point here this is a\n[875.8s] good point listen to it young men and\n[878.2s] women and all of us and\n[882.2s] myself yes this is the point I'm reading\n[885.0s] in one such meeting when they were in\n[887.8s] one of the meetings of one of the\n[889.4s] Evangelistic meetings come\n[891.6s] meeting there was a young lady there was\n[894.9s] what young lady there was a young lady\n[898.5s] called la Bruce\n[900.3s] Thomson Ellen Bruce\n[904.6s] Thomson one such meeting there was a\n[907.0s] young\n[908.1s] lady Helen Bruce Thompson who was a\n[912.1s] volunteer\n[917.2s] pianist\n[919.0s] Helen Bruce\n[923.5s] Thomson Helen Bruce THS\n[930.1s] [Music]\n[940.3s] pianist from\n[951.1s] GL why are you not writing this thing\n[954.6s] very\n[956.5s] important the next convention you be one\n[959.0s] will be teaching us the Adventist\n[960.4s] history\n[962.1s] K very\n[967.0s] important Glo is from\n[970.2s] Glo Glo\n[973.2s] Church spelling is g l o s g o\n[979.4s] Wu g l o s g o w GL go\n[987.3s] church and AR is CasCal remember CasCal\n[991.4s] is called CasCal AR so sometimes when I\n[993.7s] use the word AR you know it is CasCal AR\n[996.8s] it\n[998.1s] wasal grandv so this this young lady\n[1002.9s] Bruce Thomson a volunteer fromo church\n[1005.8s] and AR found himself concentrating more\n[1009.8s] on the music than the Sal\n[1014.3s] Moon Arthur found himself concentrating\n[1018.2s] more on the music than the what than the\n[1023.6s] salon than the\n[1027.7s] salon so when Helen was playing\n[1032.0s] piano CasCal now loved what music than\n[1036.4s] the\n[1038.2s] what so what that is what you want to\n[1040.5s] look\n[1041.6s] at later\n[1044.6s] later now the word later means not not\n[1047.2s] that year the word later not be 1902 so\n[1050.3s] that we see\n[1054.4s] later anden became\n[1057.9s] hband so\n[1060.2s] lat\n[1061.7s] lat\n[1064.2s] so was concentrating on music\n[1071.2s] on so lat later you want to see that was\n[1075.4s] later so you want to look at later\n[1083.4s] I those who are just coming in we are\n[1085.8s] talking about the history of the

years\n[1290.3s] he was 27 years of\n[1298.3s] age you can also ending you can that was\n[1303.4s] officiated\n[1305.2s] by Elma\n[1307.8s] Elis Elma e l m e r Elis\n[1314.4s] wat Elma Elis wat Brit British Union\n[1318.1s] president\n[1320.1s] Elma El wat wat this thing wat this so\n[1324.3s] El wat is one name Elma Elis British\n[1328.6s] Union\n[1330.4s] president the oration was officed by\n[1332.9s] Elma Elis British Union president and\n[1335.4s] assisted by abber\n[1346.5s] [Music]\n[1348.9s] e\n[1350.2s] r b e r t\n[1355.0s] habat Hab\n[1357.8s] cden how about\n[1364.2s] cden who was the principal elect of the\n[1367.5s] stand stur\n[1369.9s] College who was the principal elect of\n[1372.7s] the stand Boro colle\n[1383.4s] so that one took place in\n[1386.9s] 1906 now after that now the work of\n[1390.2s] caline\n[1393.5s] began after CasCal oration it was It was\n[1397.8s] decided to send him as a missionary to\n[1399.6s] British East Africa in bracket Kenya I\n[1402.6s] believe those who have gone to school\n[1404.0s] you understand British Africa how they\n[1407.4s] divided and for you to come somewhere\n[1409.8s] you are only to go under where your\n[1411.4s] people are so was to come with America\n[1413.8s] because America not\n[1416.1s] any and the were only to come following\n[1419.5s] the\n[1421.6s] British so if you are coming from\n[1424.5s] Britain you are only to go where the\n[1427.8s] British and you to go through the\n[1429.8s] missionaries are they were working to\n[1433.2s] together I hope you know that\n[1436.5s] so that that is why it was very\n[1439.2s] difficult\n[1440.1s] for for people to go to Tanzania because\n[1443.4s] were only Germans so for you to attend a\n[1445.8s] missionary send\n[1447.3s] it German protor there so he came to\n[1452.2s] British after Calo it was decided to\n[1455.6s] send him as a missionary to British East\n[1459.4s] Africa British East Africa in bracket\n[1462.6s] Kenya\n[1483.0s] he came\n[1484.0s] alone but request he was he came\n[1488.7s] alone he came alone Remember by 1906 he\n[1491.9s] had not\n[1493.1s] married we wrot a point later they\n[1495.4s]

stations it was in and the South alone\n[3709.0s] in\n[3709.8s] central Anglican had gone there and\n[3712.6s] remember the British had said something\n[3715.1s] that they did not want interfere with\n[3717.3s] other missionaries so you are to go\n[3719.5s] where another Christian Missionary has\n[3721.4s] never entered because they were saying\n[3723.9s] it is Big please find somewhere people\n[3726.6s] have not gone to so that they may not be\n[3728.3s] able to fight themselves they knew that\n[3730.8s] if they do that Africans will not accept\n[3733.9s] the what the gospel so they didn't want\n[3737.2s] to fight among themselves that is what\n[3740.3s] they were doing those times\n[3744.5s] um to know\n[3746.9s] thanks to\n[3748.6s] not to\n[3750.8s] not things to\n[3753.5s] not this is very important for the\n[3757.2s] missionaries here some people may think\n[3758.9s] that there was money flowing from Europe\n[3762.6s] or from America to this missionaries I\n[3765.9s] found this one very important for us\n[3768.5s] that from\n[3770.5s] 1906 from 1906 when these missionaries\n[3773.6s] arrived the first money the first money\n[3777.2s] to arrive was\n[3781.6s] 22,500 Sterling\n[3785.2s] pound which arrived from the general\n[3800.4s] conference it arrived from the general\n[3802.6s] conference\n[3807.1s] through\n[3808.5s] Mombasa through Mombasa missionary\n[3816.9s] Society it arrived 7 years after the\n[3820.0s] missionaries had arrived that is the\n[3821.5s] first money they\n[3823.3s] received\n[3824.9s] 2,500 Sterling pound and it came after 7\n[3828.6s] years you can ask\n[3831.5s] yourself how was casalin\n[3834.2s] eating how was coming to KY to open the\n[3837.5s] Mission Station when the first money to\n[3840.4s] be sent came after 7\n[3842.6s] years that is something to\n[3847.6s] note that is something to be what noted\n[3850.8s] that the money arrived after what 7\n[3855.2s] years from the general conference that\n[3857.5s] is the Sterling pound\n[3860.4s] 2500 that is something to be noted\n[3862.7s] number two to be noted during World War\n[3865.6s] One one many things were\n[3867.5s] looted and damaged and workers except\n[3870.8s] castaline and others were kept from the\n[3874.6s] station nearly 2 years World War I was\n[3878.4s] in\n[3880.2s] 1914 World War one was in\n[3883.0s] 1914 during that time the properties of\n[3886.9s] were damage the things that the church\n[3888.5s] had done were damaged and some workers\n[3891.2s] had to be removed only CasCal were kept\n[3894.7s] in the station in the British\n[3896.4s] protectorate for 2 years without working\n[3899.8s] as a result of World War\n[3902.8s] I until America entered the war in\n[3906.2s] 1917 which stopped the war because the\n[3910.0s] War was between\n[3912.6s] triple and Triple Alliance in\n[3917.8s] 1921 in\n[3923.1s] 1921 Calen returned to us in this he\n[3928.4s] returned to the US so Calin was not\n[3931.1s] buried in Gia he went\n[3934.6s] back he was not buried here he went back\n[3939.5s] to\n[3940.6s] us and in the same year he\n[3943.9s] went in the same year he\n[3948.0s] returned his wife Ellen died in\n[3954.0s] Oregon his wife Ellen died in\n[3958.1s] Oregon and castaline remained without a\n[3963.4s] wife I think it was around 58 years from\n[3966.8s] 197 1879 to\n[3970.6s] 1921 was how many\n[3973.7s] years 1879 to\n[3977.5s] 1921 it was how many\n[3980.3s] years\n[3983.3s] huh 40\n[3986.7s] 19\n[3987.7s] 1879 to\n[3991.4s] 1921\n[3993.5s] 42 he was\n[3996.5s] 42 okay 42 years the wife died in\n[4004.8s] 1924 pascaline\n[4007.1s] married Anita\n[4011.6s] jamen married an\n[4021.1s] Johnson after the wife died she married\n[4025.0s] that one is allowed she married a lady\n[4027.0s] called Anita\n[4040.0s] Jameson and\n[4043.6s] uh meanwhile other missionaries arrived\n[4047.2s] in\n[4048.0s] gendia other missionaries arrived in\n[4050.4s] gendia they included\n[4053.3s] g\n[4055.2s] g mad\n[4058.5s] mad mad arrived in\n[4063.1s] gendia\n[4065.7s] WT bnet arrived in\n[4069.0s] gendia but L and WW Armstrong also\n[4074.1s] arrived in

president of\n[4111.0s] the three fields in\n[4117.2s] British final thing to\n[4119.6s] note that Publishing House the small\n[4122.5s] printing house was started in 1910 to\n[4125.6s] 1914 by\n[4128.8s] CasCal and finally\n[4131.9s] CasCal in the east of the ls he wrote\n[4135.1s] four\n[4137.5s] 04 words of the L\n[4140.2s] dictionary which was tered as L\n[4143.1s] dictionary the

supported by\n[4184.6s] the hand workk those two the reason why\n[4187.5s] the money did not come from the general\n[4189.2s] confence but the workers help themselves\n[4192.3s] the wife started coton farming and that\n[4195.9s] one was helping to use the clothes the\n[4197.5s] young men that were baptized were\n[4200.2s] helping in NW work in the morning and in\n[4203.2s] the afternoon they were

go to the next one and uh we said when you see America claps with room then marvelous talking of sat begins so yesterday we saw this be represent United States of America we give the [Music] history let's go uh and now this is very important a prominent writer describing uh the rise of the United States and there was my brother there who also understood history well so when this prominent writer was describing the rise of the United States he speaks of the mystery of coming forth from V [Music] like silent seed we into EMP so that is year town the new world uh compared with compar the so he says America just came like a silent SE growing to become a very big treeist the Beast coming from the Earth [Music] so that is it as we wait again this I wanted to I was thinking that I can also be opening this one to use and now this one has never behaved the way it is behaving uh and uh we want to [Music] move this will come back again I will R to tell you to show you very first what I wanted to show you so let's just wait to there very fast there so European General 1850 also spoke of the United States as a wonderful Empire which was emerging amid the Silence of the earth uh that one is in European America came as an emerging Empire it was silent by the way that is why God had to hide this church in America like a country country country living from that word wild go go go ahead very fast uh God is faithful found refuge in America during religious when my brother was ending the message of country I saw him with people let me tell you that even the Church of God for the Church of God to preserve the truth the Book of Revelation tells [Music] you by the waying mess in the third Angel message because America for God's people God's faithful people to find ref they went to a land where there were few people and the Bible call it the wilderness come to team team team I mean yes so it was it was there they were hiding look at them this what were they using to go to America these are the things they used if you read about pilg fathers Pilgrim uh fathers they were using this boat ships to travel to America to escape for their life it was a long dist Jour The Book of Revelation 12 says that the devil wanted to finish them but the church had to escape anytime you read Revelation for God to preserve a Remnant they must leave their Natives and friends and go very far away any you have run from your home as a of religious Li then you run and go very so that you may be able to worship God according to the your Liberty of conscience and then later on you become tired and start thinking about home before you start looking at the numbers of the people and then that means you are starting to to protestantism is dying and then few to invite the people from your home to come and visit you where you are also you also visit them that is when we talk of clasping hands and they will start controlling you this people men and women and children they were kneeling down praying asking God to take care of these are the things they used all these messages are in the book of great controversy let's go ahead let's run very fast are you sleeping okay so when you now this

At 12 midnight, the vital sign showed further decline and she went to rest at 12:30 a.m. Sunday morning of 16th March 2025. Remembrance. Though our hearts are heavy and we are grieving, we take solace in the moments we shared with mom. She not only served and took care of the family faithfully, but diligently served the Lord. Her assignment was evangeline and quoted verses to the family members, friends, and the public whenever she had time. She loved her family dearly and has left has left a void that will be hard to fill. She raised her children in the Christian foundation. Her life was a reflection of the Proverbs 31 woman. Her children arise and call her blessed, her husband too. Apart from her children, she was a great mother and a mentor to many. Among them, Angela Mug, Dina Rug, Florence, Sunum, Julius Rug, Alfred L, Juliana Sawe, Susan Budich, and many, many others. We are grateful to St. Luke's Hospital. We are grateful to Bethesda and any medic who came to assist mama. We are sincerely grateful from the bottom of our hearts. May her soul rest in eternal peace. Church history. Magdalene was a woman of deep faith, devoted, unwavering, and always seeking the truth. Her spiritual journey was one of conviction and courage. She began her walk with God in in the Catholic Church, but in 1998 felt called to a different path and joined the 7th Day Adventist Church. More than two decades later, in 2020, her pursuit for of biblical truth led her to the 7th Day Adventist Reform Movement, a group committed to the original fundamental principles of the Adventist faith. She firmly rejected the doctrine of the Trinity, believing instead in the one true God and his son as written in John 17:3 and 1 Timothy 2:5. Magdalene held fast to this faith, never wavering, never compromising. She lived it, she breathed it, and shared it with all who crossed her path. If you visited her, you heard the gospel spoken with conviction, love, and an unshakable belief in the message she had embraced. She was not just a follower of Christ. She was a messenger, tenacious in her mission until the very end.",

Cal of the Catholic fath everyone who opposed to the of Trinity exterminated was of [Music] is the central of the Catholic fa then it means that worship is not a central if you are forever andever andever that is why Islams Muslims are praying on Wednesday but what makes them together Catholic now this is books of adventi volume 158 31 Special Edition July 30th 1981 day the Adventist are

        "full_transcript": "back to yesterday. Do you think you can still remember? Who remember what we covered on day one? Yes. You forgotten. Yes. So day one we covered spiritual gifts. Was that a tool? Our second session was on what? Yes. On talents. Can you remember that? So session two we covered the talents and on spiritual gift and talents. It was for those endorsements which we've been given both spiritually, naturally or acquired. You remember that that the Lord requires that all our talents be brought. You remember some of the talents? What did we say? One time, speech, health, strength, influence, etc., etc. Now that was day two, talents. Day three, what did we talk about? Yes. The Bible and work. Amen. Do you remember that? You don't seem to remember. I'm very sorry and sad at the same time that you can't remember. Then we went to session number four. What did we cover on session number four? Yes. Self-support work proper session one. And we took the gospel options. We talked about sections in the gospel which are the gospel in themselves yet they can help us in support. We mentioned things like medical, missionary, publishing and media. You remember that right? You just agree that that's the thing. Then we went to session number five. Now that one is easier for you to guess. What was session number five? Yes. self-support proper number two right and we talked about secular innocent occupation which we could have given them they do not the goal principle and the gospel in the mention things like agriculture and do what yeah we say technical options like carpentry electrical and etc etc. Then we came to that was session number what number five right? Did I say number five or number six? Then we come to session number six. After self support work proper number two we went to what? Principles of success. Right which we reviewed yesterday. We said principle number one commit to the law. Principle number two pay the tithe. Principle number three be agent. Principle number four, don't make haste. Principle number five, yes, avoid that. Principle number six, keep records. Principle number seven, avoid covetousness, proud and extortion. Amen. That was our session number six. Then we come to session number seven which was yesterday. What did we talk about yesterday? It was an extension of principle. So what was principle number eight? Frugality and economy. And now we sum up and we come to session number eight. By God's grace I have had eight session and this is session number eight. And we are talking about ministers and work. Now you realize that what we have covered so far is applicable to all of us. This session is especially dedicated to those who are ministers and they are operating on gospel work proper. Amen. Let me just see by a show of hands how many of us are ministers. Those who are acknowledged missionaries. Let me see. I mean thank you. Those who are doing the gospel work proper. You understand that? Yeah. You are not um doing your things on the long run with the gospel. Your primary work is the gospel. You understand that if I'm a carpenter, I am doing carpentry while I minister. You understand that? But if I'm a missionary, my missionary work is the primary work. But I can still do other things which can help me as I do missionary work. I'm speaking to that category of people. Amen. Now, I say this session is dedicated to ministers. That doesn't mean the church doesn't need to know it, but it's dedicated to ministers because they are the ones whose um I mean of whom this example is given and so we are talking about ministers and work. Now, today I did not prepare powerpoints. So I'll just be reading from the spirit of prophecy from the book Acts of the Apocus from from page 346 onwards. So I just did some um screenshots and I'll be sharing you can follow from your estates because I'll just be reading continuously. Now I hope by this by the end of this session I can now say the youth must decide for himself. Amen. Because you will have covered a great deal which can make you to make the decisions. No one is to make the decision for anyone. You hear the gospel, apply the principles in your life and embrace the gospel or reject the gospel. That's the work of a minister who stands to teach this chapter three. Laboring under difficulties. Now you know the life of Paul and I. I asked you across the week. I ask you this question again. Was Paul a full-time minister or part-time minister? Full-time minister. And we agree. Now in the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 12 the very last part and chapter 13 which is still the extension of chapter 12 the Bible says that can someone get it get me that verse which says desire the higher what the higher offices. How does it say desire the higher gifts or the greater gifts? No. Is that the one I want? I want the one which says for he set primarily the apostles, secondarily the prophets, then thirdly teachers and then healings. That verse. Did anyone get it? First Corinthians chapter 12. The almost the last part of it. Chapter 12 almost the last verse. It could be the second last or the third last verse. Did you see verse 28? 28. What does it say? Yes. Says and come in the first one. Which one? Apostles. Yes. Then prophets. Teachers. Teachers. Miracles. Miracles. Then gifts of healing, healing, helps, governments, then tongues. Those are eight gifts highlighted there. Which one is the greatest of all those gifts? The Bible has given the order. Apostle is the biggest office. Amen. Then which one is the second biggest gift? Prophet. Then which one is the third biggest gift? Teachers. Amen. I ask you this question. How many apostles are in this church? Any prophet, teacher? So you acknowledge that the gift of a teacher is in this church. And it is gift number three. We may not have the rest of the gifts. Number four, what? Miracles. Miracles. Then five, healings. Healings. Helps. Then helps. Helps means you can easily identify someone in need and you can help them. Amen. It's a gift. Then government. Government means church officers. Those who are doing the administrative work. We need an elder. We need a deacon. We need a cler. You know those administrative work. Amen. I ask you as the manifestation of the spirit being manifested in our church and the spirit divide these gifts severally to whomsoever he will. Amen. So if the gift is given in this church maybe the gift of teaching and not prophecy. Should we complain that the Lord has left us off we do not have a prophet prophet. No we have the gift of teaching at least of helps at least of governments. Amen. How many gifts are those? We may not have miracles and healings and speaking in tongues. But we praise the Lord because he saw heat fit for our church to have teaching and helps and governments. Amen. That's it. And so I ask you now Paul being a missionary had which gift? Apostle is that the highest office? Yeah. Do we agree on that? Amen. So an apostle primarily means someone who is done what? Sent. Amen. Do you understand that? That this is the missionary in the truest sense. He has been sent with a message. Now Paul had that office. But now we want to learn from his example from someone who had the highest office of all the offices the spirit can give to the church and of his conduct in this in relation to work because we are talking about self-support. Amen. and how we can blend these talents to achieve uh the success of the gospel. Now we beginning from 3.6 paragraph one said while Paul was careful to set before his converts the plain teachings of scripture regarding the proper support of the work of God. And while he claimed for himself as a minister of the gospel the power to forbear working that's 1 Corinthians 9:6 a secular employment as a means of self-support yet at various times during his ministry in the great centers of civilization he wrote at handic at handiccraft for his own maintenance amen with the highest gift of the holy spirit which is apostilhip he had the right to forbear to stop working in a secular to commit his life to apostilhip which means to be sent. He had the right to do that. Yet we are told at times he wrote at an handiccraft. He did something with his hands to provide means for himself in the great centers of civilization. Amen. Which centers of civilization did Paul visit? Tell me those major cities which he went. One he was at Antioch the first. Then he went where? Corinth is at the furthest end over the other side. Okay. So do we begin with Corinth? He went to Philippi. He went to Ephesus. He went to Galastia. Is that a city route? Maybe it's a region. Yes. What? What did you say? Macedonia is still a region. Philippia and Corinth are now regions. and Athens are the cities of Macedonia and Corinth and not and Corinth. What did you say? You said Macedonia and Yeah, it's Macedonia, not Macedonia and somewhere else. Okay. But in those centers of civilization, Paul wrote at an anticcraft. He did something with his hands to support himself. Amen. But we are told here he had a right to stop working, but he didn't. Amen. Was he less of an apostle? Yeah, I think we will still read something. We had read this quote. The Jews, among the Jews, physical toil was not thought strange or degrading. So among the Jews, it was not thought like walking is degrading. You know there is a prevailing ideology in our generation that we think walking with our hands is degrading. Right? Once you've completed university, I think again you know I was there some day after coming from the university you feel so hesitant you think people are saying hey you understand you think you are supposed to be doing some higher jobs which are not higher in themselves but because the societ has placed them high. So among the Jews that idea was not there. Working with hands was considered a normal thing. I will just jump that paragraph and go down here. Um before he became a disciple of Christ, Paul had occupied a high position and was not dependent upon manual labor for sports. So you understand and even us you may walking as a n as a doctor as a teacher and all those stuff we have tried before and before you embrace the gospel of Christ and before you become a disciple you not you do not depend on manual on manual labor to support yourself. Yes, but afterward where he had used all his means in furthering the course of time, he resorted at times to his trade to gain a livelihood. Amen. So, not being this prayer for leisure. He was doing it to support his livelihood. He needed it for his livelihood because he had spent everything that he had for the gospel course. Especially was this the case where his motives might have misunderstood. Paul will go to places where his motives of preaching might be misunderstood. What is motive? The reason why you are in a place right sometimes means we are in a place where people can misunderstand our motives. These people might are coming to preach so that and Paul thought it's wise when he go to such places to do something else. It's a testimony here that we have of working with hand instead of supporting labor while preaching the word. So he preaching the word writing the church of believers there he reminded them that he might have some to them and added you remember our travel for laboring night and day because would not be unto any of you. We preach unto you the gospel of God and have favor that he will not be chargeable to the president. Amen. He did that. And he said, \"And again in his second epistle to them, he declared he and his laborer while with them had not eaten any man's bread for not.\" Night and day we work, he wrote that we might not be charged to any organ, not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensemble and to follow. Amen. So Paul did not work. And he says not because they have a right to partake of the means that was provided by the church but because he wanted to give them an example so that Paul may easily say follow me as I follow who I follow Christ man you again apostles is the highest office of all the office of a prophet at the Paul had met those who refused to work with their hands It was this afterward. There are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busy bodies. Now them that are with command exalt by our Lord Jesus Christ, they with what? Quietness they walk and eat their own bread. Amen. Are we still together? So Paul met people who refused to walk with their hands and he wrote afterward that we hear that there are some who walk disorderly. So if you advance the idea that we should not be walking, you are walking disorderly. If you advance the idea of indolence and idleness, you are walking disorderly. And what is the exhaltation? He said with quietness go and walk and eat your own bread. Amen. So we we read that that is 32 paragraph 3. In every age, Satan has sought to impair the efforts of God's servants by introducing into the church a spirit of fanaticism. Says that it was in Paul's day. What's fanaticism? You know what it means to be fanatic? What does that mean? It is Yes. having too much interest into something or too much something that overtakes your normal thoughts. Thank you. I think you got it. It's like advancing fanciful and extreme ideas about something that at the expense of the normal operations of life. Right? That's it. So if you are a football fanatic, you put football ahead of everything. You understand that? Now you got it. And people will say, \"Are you a fan of football?\" Yeah. Are you a football fanatic? Because fan is the short form of saying a fanatic. You understand that? Yeah, I'm a football fan. You are a fanatic. Too bad for you to be a fanatic. But we are told Satan has sought to impair the efforts of God's servant by introducing into the church a spirit of what? Panaticism. I ask you this question again. Where is the devil introducing the spirit of fanatism into the world or into the church? The spirit of prophecy has said often and often we need to be so careful about the spirit of what? Paththeism. If we embrace a message, we should be guarded because the devil will always be there to make it too extreme. You understand? And that's what was happening with Paul as it was in Paul's day and as it was in later centuries during the time of the reformation Luther and many others who blessed the world by their influence on their faith encountered WS by which the enemy seeks to lead into fanaticism over zas unbalanced and unsanctified minds. Misguided source of thought that the attainment of true holiness carry the mind above all earthly thoughts and leads men to refrain holy from labor. Did you get that statement? Do I need to explain it? So there is a thought that people think that if you must be holy and be a Christian, you need to abstain from walking complete completely. And the spirit of prophecy goes ahead to say others taking extreme views of certain text of scripture have thought that it is a sin to work that Christians should take no thought concerning the temporal welfare of themselves or their families but should devote their lives wholly to spiritual things. So if someone is saying we must not work we must not care about temporal things that one is a fanatical view. Hello Now sorry because you are now robbed the other direction. So and he says you take extreme views of certain texts like which text?",
        "timestamped_transcript": "[0.0s] back to yesterday. Do you think you can\n[2.4s] still remember? Who remember what we\n[5.2s] covered on day\n[9.8s] one?\n[13.0s] Yes. You\n[15.6s] forgotten.\n[19.4s] Yes. So day one we covered spiritual\n[24.0s] gifts. Was that a\n[26.6s] tool? Our second session was on\n[31.1s] what?\n[34.4s] Yes. On\n[36.5s] talents. Can you remember that? So\n[39.8s] session two we covered the talents and\n[41.5s] on spiritual gift and\n[43.2s] talents. It was for those endorsements\n[45.4s] which we've been given both spiritually,\n[48.3s] naturally or acquired. You remember that\n[51.3s] that the Lord requires that all our\n[53.5s] talents be brought. You remember some of\n[55.9s] the\n[56.7s] talents? What did we say?\n[59.8s] One\n[62.5s] time,\n[65.6s] speech, health, strength, influence,\n[69.8s] etc., etc. Now that was day two,\n[72.6s] talents. Day\n[76.0s] three, what did we talk about?\n[82.8s] Yes. The Bible and work.\n[86.5s] Amen. Do you remember that? You don't\n[89.8s] seem to remember. I'm very sorry and sad\n[91.9s] at the same time that you can't\n[93.8s] remember. Then we went to session number\n[96.2s] four. What did we cover on session\n[97.6s] number\n[98.7s] four?\n[101.6s] Yes. Self-support work proper session\n[105.8s] one. And we took the\n[108.4s] gospel options. We talked about sections\n[112.4s] in the gospel which are the gospel in\n[114.9s] themselves yet they can help us in\n[117.4s] support. We mentioned things like\n[119.4s] medical, missionary, publishing and\n[121.1s] media. You remember\n[122.5s] that right? You just agree that that's\n[125.3s] the thing. Then we went to session\n[127.5s] number\n[128.4s] five. Now that one is easier for you to\n[131.0s] guess. What was session number\n[134.0s] five? Yes.\n[139.2s] self-support proper number two right and\n[143.1s] we talked about secular innocent\n[146.4s] occupation which we could have given\n[148.6s] them they do not the goal\n[150.9s] principle and the gospel in the mention\n[155.0s] things\n[156.2s] like\n[158.6s] agriculture and do\n[161.2s] what yeah we say technical options like\n[164.8s] carpentry\n[167.3s] electrical and etc etc. Then we came to\n[171.8s] that was session number what number five\n[174.3s] right? Did I say number five or number\n[177.2s] six? Then we come to session number six.\n[180.7s] After self support work proper number\n[183.2s] two we went to\n[185.6s] what? Principles of success. Right which\n[189.7s] we reviewed yesterday. We said principle\n[191.8s] number one commit to the law. Principle\n[194.1s] number two pay the tithe. Principle\n[196.6s] number three\n[199.3s] be agent. Principle number\n[202.5s] four, don't make haste. Principle number\n[206.6s] five,\n[209.3s] yes, avoid that. Principle number\n[214.6s] six, keep records. Principle number\n[219.8s] seven, avoid covetousness, proud and\n[223.8s] extortion. Amen. That was our session\n[226.9s] number six. Then we come to session\n[229.1s] number seven which was yesterday. What\n[232.0s] did we talk about\n[235.5s] yesterday? It was an extension of\n[237.8s] principle. So what was principle number\n[239.7s] eight?\n[242.8s] Frugality and economy. And now we sum up\n[247.1s] and we come to session number eight. By\n[249.7s] God's grace I have had eight session and\n[251.5s] this is session number eight. And we are\n[253.3s] talking about ministers and work. Now\n[255.8s] you realize that what we have covered so\n[257.8s] far is applicable to all of us. This\n[260.5s] session is especially dedicated to those\n[263.2s] who are ministers and they are operating\n[266.4s] on gospel work proper. Amen. Let me just\n[270.3s] see by a show of hands how many of us\n[272.2s] are\n[273.6s] ministers. Those who are acknowledged\n[275.8s] missionaries. Let me\n[277.6s] see. I\n[279.9s] mean thank you. Those who are doing the\n[283.4s] gospel work proper. You understand that?\n[286.5s] Yeah. You are not um doing your things\n[289.3s] on the long run with the gospel. Your\n[292.2s] primary work is the gospel. You\n[294.5s] understand that if I'm a carpenter, I am\n[297.4s] doing carpentry while I minister. You\n[299.2s] understand that? But if I'm a\n[301.1s] missionary, my missionary work is the\n[303.8s] primary work. But I can still do other\n[306.3s] things which can help me as I do\n[309.3s] missionary work. I'm speaking to that\n[312.0s] category of people. Amen. Now, I say\n[316.1s] this session is dedicated to ministers.\n[320.1s] That doesn't mean the church doesn't\n[322.3s] need to know it, but it's dedicated to\n[325.6s] ministers because they are the ones\n[327.9s] whose\n[329.5s] um I mean of whom this example is given\n[333.3s] and so we are talking about ministers\n[335.8s] and work. Now, today I did not prepare\n[338.6s] powerpoints. So I'll just be reading\n[340.6s] from the spirit of prophecy from the\n[342.8s] book Acts of the Apocus from from page\n[346.4s] 346 onwards. So I just did some\n[351.8s] um screenshots and I'll be sharing you\n[355.0s] can follow from your estates because\n[357.1s] I'll just be reading continuously.\n[362.0s] Now I hope by this by the end of this\n[365.3s] session I can now\n[367.2s] say the\n[370.3s] youth must decide for himself. Amen.\n[375.6s] Because you will have covered a great\n[377.0s] deal which can make you to make the\n[379.3s] decisions. No one is to make the\n[380.9s] decision for anyone. You hear the\n[383.2s] gospel, apply the principles in your\n[385.6s] life and embrace the gospel or reject\n[388.2s] the gospel. That's the work of a\n[389.8s] minister who stands to teach this\n[392.9s] chapter three. Laboring under\n[394.6s] difficulties. Now you know the life of\n[396.4s] Paul and I. I asked you across the week.\n[399.0s] I ask you this question again. Was Paul\n[402.9s] a full-time minister or part-time\n[407.6s] minister? Full-time minister. And we\n[409.8s] agree. Now in the book of 1 Corinthians\n[413.4s] chapter 12 the very last part and\n[415.8s] chapter 13 which is still the extension\n[418.0s] of chapter 12 the Bible says\n[422.0s] that can someone get it get me that\n[424.8s] verse which\n[426.9s] says\n[429.4s] desire the higher what the higher\n[431.6s] offices. How does it say desire the\n[433.3s] higher gifts or the greater\n[438.4s] gifts? No. Is that the one I want? I\n[441.1s] want the one which says for he set\n[444.3s] primarily the apostles, secondarily the\n[447.0s] prophets, then thirdly teachers and then\n[451.3s] healings. That verse. Did anyone get it?\n[457.6s] First Corinthians chapter 12. The almost\n[461.2s] the last part of\n[463.0s] it. Chapter\n[465.0s] 12 almost the last verse. It could be\n[467.7s] the second last or the third last verse.\n[470.2s] Did you see\n[472.4s] verse 28? 28. What does it say?\n[476.9s] Yes.\n[482.0s] Says and come in the first one. Which\n[486.7s] one? Apostles. Yes.\n[490.5s] Then prophets. Teachers. Teachers.\n[494.1s] Miracles. Miracles. Then gifts of\n[496.5s] healing,\n[497.6s] healing, helps, governments,\n[502.5s] then tongues. Those are eight gifts\n[505.0s] highlighted there. Which one is the\n[507.0s] greatest of all those\n[508.8s] gifts? The Bible has given the order.\n[512.6s] Apostle is the biggest office. Amen.\n[515.4s] Then which one is the second biggest\n[517.0s] gift?\n[518.6s] Prophet. Then which one is the third\n[520.1s] biggest gift? Teachers. Amen. I ask you\n[524.6s] this question. How many apostles are in\n[526.2s] this\n[527.9s] church? Any\n[530.0s] prophet,\n[531.9s] teacher? So you acknowledge that the\n[534.2s] gift of a teacher is in this church. And\n[537.0s] it is gift number three. We may not have\n[540.4s] the rest of the gifts. Number four,\n[541.8s] what?\n[543.6s] Miracles. Miracles. Then five, healings.\n[547.2s] Healings.\n[549.4s] Helps. Then helps. Helps means you can\n[552.1s] easily identify someone in need and you\n[553.9s] can help them. Amen. It's a gift. Then\n[556.4s] government. Government means church\n[557.9s] officers. Those who are doing the\n[560.1s] administrative work. We need an elder.\n[561.9s] We need a deacon. We need a cler. You\n[563.3s] know those administrative work. Amen. I\n[566.3s] ask you as the manifestation of the\n[568.8s] spirit being manifested in our church\n[573.5s] and the spirit divide these gifts\n[576.6s] severally to whomsoever he will. Amen.\n[580.2s] So if the gift is given in this church\n[582.6s] maybe the gift of teaching and not\n[584.1s] prophecy. Should we complain that the\n[585.8s] Lord has left us off we do not have a\n[587.5s] prophet prophet. No we have the gift of\n[590.3s] teaching at least of helps at least of\n[592.7s] governments. Amen. How many gifts are\n[594.7s] those? We may not have miracles and\n[597.4s] healings and speaking in tongues. But we\n[599.1s] praise the Lord because he saw heat fit\n[601.6s] for our church to have teaching and\n[603.9s] helps and governments. Amen. That's it.\n[606.9s] And so I ask you now Paul being a\n[611.2s] missionary had which gift?\n[615.1s] Apostle is that the highest office?\n[617.7s] Yeah. Do we agree on that? Amen.\n[622.0s] So an\n[623.7s] apostle primarily means someone who is\n[626.9s] done what? Sent. Amen.\n[636.2s] Do you understand that? That this is the\n[638.6s] missionary in the truest sense. He has\n[642.7s] been sent with a message. Now Paul had\n[645.7s] that office. But now we want to learn\n[647.8s] from his example from someone who had\n[650.5s] the highest office of all the offices\n[652.9s] the spirit can give to the church and of\n[656.0s] his conduct in this in relation to work\n[658.8s] because we are talking about\n[659.8s] self-support. Amen. and how we can blend\n[663.0s] these talents to achieve uh the success\n[667.0s] of the gospel. Now we beginning from 3.6\n[669.3s] paragraph one said while Paul was\n[671.8s] careful to set before his converts the\n[673.8s] plain teachings of scripture regarding\n[676.4s] the proper support of the work of God.\n[680.1s] And while he claimed for himself as a\n[682.2s] minister of the gospel the power to\n[683.8s] forbear working that's 1 Corinthians 9:6\n[686.9s] a secular employment as a means of\n[688.9s] self-support yet at various times during\n[691.2s] his ministry in the great centers of\n[692.9s] civilization he wrote at handic at\n[696.0s] handiccraft for his own maintenance\n[699.1s] amen with the highest gift of the holy\n[702.6s] spirit which is\n[703.8s] apostilhip he had the right to forbear\n[707.3s] to stop working in a secular\n[710.0s] to commit his life to apostilhip which\n[714.5s] means to be sent. He had the right to do\n[717.2s] that. Yet we are told at times he wrote\n[721.7s] at an handiccraft. He did something with\n[723.8s] his hands to provide means for himself\n[727.7s] in the great centers of civilization.\n[729.8s] Amen. Which centers of civilization did\n[732.3s] Paul visit? Tell me those major cities\n[734.6s] which he went.\n[736.0s] One he was at Antioch the first. Then he\n[738.8s] went\n[740.0s] where? Corinth is at the furthest end\n[742.7s] over the other side. Okay. So do we\n[744.7s] begin with Corinth?\n[749.4s] He went to Philippi. He went to\n[752.4s] Ephesus. He went to Galastia. Is that a\n[755.1s] city route? Maybe it's a region.\n[758.7s] Yes. What? What did you say? Macedonia\n[761.9s] is still a region. Philippia and Corinth\n[763.7s] are now regions. and Athens are the\n[766.2s] cities of Macedonia and Corinth and not\n[769.3s] and Corinth. What did you say? You said\n[771.3s] Macedonia\n[773.0s] and Yeah, it's Macedonia, not Macedonia\n[775.8s] and somewhere else. Okay. But in those\n[778.2s] centers of civilization,\n[780.4s] Paul wrote at an anticcraft. He did\n[783.3s] something with his hands to support\n[784.8s] himself. Amen. But we are told here he\n[787.4s] had a right to stop\n[790.5s] working, but he didn't. Amen.\n[794.7s] Was he less of an\n[796.7s] apostle? Yeah, I think we will still\n[798.7s] read something. We had read this quote.\n[801.3s] The Jews, among the Jews, physical toil\n[804.0s] was not thought strange or degrading. So\n[806.7s] among the Jews, it was not thought like\n[809.1s] walking is degrading. You know there is\n[811.9s] a prevailing ideology in our generation\n[815.4s] that we think walking with our hands is\n[819.6s] degrading. Right? Once you've completed\n[822.4s] university,\n[841.8s] I think again you know I was there some\n[844.4s] day after coming from the university you\n[846.8s] feel so hesitant you think people are\n[849.8s] saying\n[853.7s] hey you understand you think you are\n[857.1s] supposed to be doing some higher jobs\n[860.5s] which are not higher in themselves but\n[862.5s] because the societ\n[863.7s] has placed them high. So among the Jews\n[867.3s] that idea was not there. Working with\n[870.0s] hands was considered a normal thing. I\n[873.0s] will just jump that paragraph and go\n[874.7s] down\n[875.7s] here.\n[877.5s] Um before he became a disciple of\n[880.8s] Christ, Paul had occupied a high\n[883.0s] position and was not dependent upon\n[885.4s] manual labor for sports. So you\n[888.5s] understand and even us you may walking\n[891.8s] as a n as a doctor as a teacher and all\n[894.6s] those stuff we have tried before and\n[897.4s] before you embrace the gospel of Christ\n[899.7s] and before you become a disciple you not\n[902.4s] you do not depend on manual on manual\n[906.2s] labor to support yourself.\n[910.0s] Yes, but afterward where he had used all\n[913.9s] his means in furthering the course of\n[916.2s] time, he resorted at times to his trade\n[919.5s] to gain a livelihood.\n[921.2s] Amen. So, not being this\n[924.5s] prayer for leisure. He was doing it to\n[928.2s] support his livelihood. He needed it for\n[931.0s] his livelihood because he had spent\n[934.6s] everything that he had for the gospel\n[937.5s] course. Especially was this the\n[940.0s] case where his motives might have\n[943.6s] misunderstood. Paul will go to places\n[946.1s] where his motives of preaching might be\n[949.8s] misunderstood. What is\n[952.8s] motive? The reason why you are in a\n[955.1s] place right sometimes means we are in a\n[958.6s] place where people can misunderstand our\n[962.6s] motives. These people might are coming\n[964.4s] to preach so\n[966.9s] that and Paul thought\n[970.4s] it's wise when he go to such places to\n[974.5s] do something else. It's a testimony here\n[977.1s] that we have of working with hand\n[980.3s] instead of supporting labor while\n[982.0s] preaching the word. So\n[984.7s] he preaching the\n[987.6s] word writing the church of believers\n[990.6s] there he reminded them that he might\n[992.6s] have some to them and added you remember\n[997.1s] our travel for laboring night and day\n[1002.5s] because would not be unto any of you. We\n[1006.0s] preach unto you the gospel of God and\n[1009.8s] have\n[1016.3s] favor that he will not be chargeable to\n[1020.0s] the\n[1030.8s] president. Amen. He did that. And he\n[1033.9s] said, \"And again in his second epistle\n[1035.9s] to them, he declared he and his laborer\n[1039.4s] while with them had not eaten any man's\n[1042.6s] bread for\n[1044.1s] not.\" Night and day we work, he wrote\n[1047.9s] that we might not be charged to any\n[1049.9s] organ, not because we have not power,\n[1052.9s] but to make ourselves an ensemble and to\n[1056.2s] follow. Amen. So Paul did not work. And\n[1061.2s] he says not because they have a right to\n[1064.1s] partake of the means that was provided\n[1066.6s] by the church but because he wanted to\n[1068.6s] give them an example so that Paul may\n[1071.8s] easily say follow me as I follow who I\n[1075.6s] follow Christ\n[1077.4s] man you again apostles is the highest\n[1081.0s] office of\n[1082.2s] all the office of a prophet at the Paul\n[1086.9s] had met those who refused to work with\n[1089.4s] their hands\n[1091.0s] It was this afterward. There are some\n[1094.6s] which walk among you disorderly, working\n[1097.4s] not at all, but are busy bodies. Now\n[1101.4s] them that are with command exalt by our\n[1104.1s] Lord Jesus Christ, they with what?\n[1106.6s] Quietness they walk and eat their own\n[1110.0s] bread.\n[1110.8s] Amen. Are we still together?\n[1114.0s] So\n[1114.9s] Paul met people who refused to walk with\n[1119.0s] their\n[1120.3s] hands and he wrote afterward that we\n[1124.4s] hear that there are some who walk\n[1126.1s] disorderly. So if you advance the idea\n[1129.8s] that we should not be\n[1131.5s] walking, you are walking disorderly. If\n[1134.8s] you advance the idea of indolence and\n[1137.5s] idleness, you are walking disorderly.\n[1140.2s] And what is the exhaltation?\n[1142.6s] He said with quietness go and walk and\n[1146.4s] eat your own bread.\n[1154.8s] Amen. So we we read that that\n[1159.6s] is 32 paragraph 3. In every age, Satan\n[1164.6s] has sought to impair the efforts of\n[1166.9s] God's servants by introducing into the\n[1170.0s] church a spirit of\n[1172.4s] fanaticism. Says that it was in Paul's\n[1176.2s] day. What's\n[1179.2s] fanaticism? You know what it means to be\n[1181.9s] fanatic? What does that\n[1184.3s] mean? It is Yes.\n[1192.7s] having too much interest into something\n[1196.3s] or too much something that overtakes\n[1200.0s] your normal thoughts.\n[1202.2s] Thank you. I think you got it. It's like\n[1205.4s] advancing fanciful and extreme ideas\n[1208.3s] about something that at the expense of\n[1211.6s] the normal operations of life. Right?\n[1214.1s] That's it. So if you are a football\n[1216.0s] fanatic, you put football ahead of\n[1219.7s] everything. You understand that? Now you\n[1222.6s] got it. And people will say, \"Are you a\n[1224.7s] fan of\n[1226.2s] football?\" Yeah. Are you a football\n[1228.5s] fanatic? Because fan is the short form\n[1230.5s] of saying a fanatic. You understand\n[1232.6s] that? Yeah, I'm a football fan. You are\n[1235.8s] a\n[1236.6s] fanatic. Too bad for you to be a\n[1239.1s] fanatic. But we are told Satan has\n[1242.9s] sought to impair the efforts of God's\n[1244.6s] servant by introducing into the church a\n[1246.4s] spirit of what? Panaticism. I ask you\n[1248.9s] this question again. Where is the devil\n[1251.6s] introducing the spirit of fanatism into\n[1254.8s] the world or into the\n[1256.3s] church? The spirit of prophecy has said\n[1258.6s] often and often we need to be so careful\n[1260.7s] about the spirit of what? Paththeism.\n[1264.7s] If we embrace a message, we should be\n[1267.8s] guarded because the devil will always be\n[1270.0s] there to make it too extreme. You\n[1272.7s] understand? And that's what was\n[1274.7s] happening with Paul as it was in Paul's\n[1277.0s] day and as it was in later centuries\n[1279.4s] during the time of the\n[1281.4s] reformation Luther and many others who\n[1284.1s] blessed the world by their influence on\n[1286.0s] their faith encountered WS by which the\n[1289.0s] enemy seeks to lead into fanaticism over\n[1292.2s] zas unbalanced and unsanctified minds.\n[1296.8s] Misguided source of thought that the\n[1299.5s] attainment of true holiness carry the\n[1301.9s] mind above all earthly thoughts and\n[1304.4s] leads men to refrain holy from labor.\n[1307.5s] Did you get that statement? Do I need to\n[1310.2s] explain it? So there is a thought that\n[1312.6s] people think that if you must be holy\n[1315.4s] and be a Christian, you need to abstain\n[1317.0s] from walking complete completely. And\n[1320.2s] the spirit of prophecy goes ahead to say\n[1322.6s] others taking extreme views of certain\n[1325.0s] text of scripture have thought that it\n[1327.6s] is a sin to work that Christians should\n[1330.4s] take no thought concerning the temporal\n[1332.3s] welfare of themselves or their families\n[1335.0s] but should devote their lives wholly to\n[1337.4s] spiritual things. So if someone is\n[1340.8s] saying we must not work we must not care\n[1343.3s] about temporal things that one is a\n[1345.7s] fanatical\n[1347.6s] view. Hello\n[1350.5s] Now sorry because you are now robbed the\n[1353.8s] other\n[1355.2s] direction. So and he says you take\n[1359.0s] extreme views of certain texts like\n[1361.5s] which text?"

just read from 1888 messages page 752 852 I think uh which which which we we we we we' seen that saying that brother fall upon the US fall upon the rock in Jesus name if reject this messages there are diseases that will come upon people of God there people will be just found sick a leader will just be SI but sometimes he has rejected something what pains me is that men are not going to realize that they have rejected something but the other men realized that they rejected the gospel of God and when they were prayed for they were healed and told them that will be using you I might have rejected a message but if we have we have seen light then we need to repent that God may help us wherever we are there are truths in this church that makes this CH some people will reject this messages you will real you will just feel sick may God open up your your eyes in that sickness so that you might not die that you may realize that know realize you made a mistake other people will just find themselves in that their legs are broken so by the time you will be trying to get healed of the your broken leg then you need to realize that you made a mistake Hallelujah this this has been our message and this message can also be found in this yes so time is almost and has our message this is the Beast that is taking the world the be and the Bible explained clearly and the spirit of Prophecy explain that let's continue very fast where we left yesterday now there's a book of [Music] microphone 33 who sitting next I want somebody to sit and read uh Isaiah this the this is all all churches are coming together I've explained this yesterday and I believe you understand people looking for but only and Christ is and Christ is the truth so you cannot say you a Christian when you are in error because those things are detrimental to our spiritual health just continue very fast you we saw thisal movement and we were here I want you to replay this video now as34 and 16 the Bible this one of the chief instigators of the they are the ones who came with thisum movement that before3 Isaiah 33:6 it says vers 14- 16 says Ah the sinners in Zion are afraid the sinners in are afraid fearfulness read in in Isaiah 33:4 yes for [Music] [Music] spe we are confing [Music] keep theud [Music] God is a consuming by the way there's a song so the of the consuming time so who wants to with right that if you're desing to go to go to heaven and live with God who are consuming fire then you are to you are to be speaking truth and of propy to be found you selfish out no selfish [Music] corruption for [Music] [Music] [Music] what is written in that Isaiah 3314 to6 is also in Psalms 15 verse1 is the same verse so there is truth there there is coming out from any corruption what bers as corruption so without that we cannot live with God are consuming fire so that means as we learn all these friends we need to pray for Christ righte and we need to pray for the Deep soul searching and self examination in Christ Jesus that as we approach this final events we may be covered by Christ Jesus is theong now this video we watch yesterday just for just replay it just put it again as a a reminder the people who might not be might not be there might not be there but those who are not there yesterday and those who are also willing to be reminded foreign spee [Music] means if you're born again raise your hand if you're born again you're a Catholic and split at the end of the first Millennium we had the Orthodox East and West two Church then 500 years later we have Luther his protest three churches in 1500 years three denominations of three churches and then from Luther's protest onwards 33,000 new [Music] denominations problem to the Catholic I come to understand that diversity is divine it's division that's diabolic it's true what you were saying about the glory I agree with you of course it's true the glory that the father had he gave to Jesus the glory was the presence of God what is the charismatic renewal is when we experience the presence of God and he said and I give them the glory that they may be want it's the glory if you accept that Christ is living in me and the presence of God is in me and the presence of God is in you that's all we need because God will sort out all our doctrines when we get upstairs therefore Christian Unity is the basis of our credibility because Jesus said until they won they will not believe the world will not believe as they should Until We Are One Division destroys our credibility it is fear that keeps us separated because fear is false evidence appearing real it's an acronym f e a r false evidence appearing real because most of your fear is based on propaganda so the isting for The worshipers Who to for the truth but people the truth refus to to Beed and come together it is Tru that is supposed to the people of God in the gr and brother PR the last being that Christ hanging on the cross beel there is something that should be our do hallelujah hallelujah today people are just talking of UN [Music] yes the world these are denominations coming in UN in the whole world and journal says that the has got a serious work of deciding what is truth and the people of Ang say that the pur what is truth and that gift will be received by Alter next one next uh slide this one I sh you yester I yesterday for example for religious liberty everybody knows that during the Middle Ages you know the the Catholic Church uh did not leave according to the that principles but to be fair to to the Catholic it changed in 1965 you know when they have the second Vatican Council because they they made a declaration for religious liberty all right guys welcome back so today we're going to talk a little bit about some things with regards to the general conference 7 Liberty next one chch we so that theing chch is going back we that in 2020in that to Adventist sign that they were now Catholic that people sear from the general conference from 2020 you know coming out of babon was not one it was in sh the one began in 1981 1995 other 1995 2000 other came out in 2000 coming out 2020 the coming out was in 2020 as was going forward was people of and you see so Adventist Catholics Orthodox and can find that there one Church the [Music] Catholic if that is whatt was signed by the S ADV chch and angan Evangelical Methodist the signing ceremony took place in the Catholic church in bolog Italy the document was signed uh all was and they promise to app to app the pro principle of the cical uh uh what cical what to each other so the churches they had agreed that there's no preaching of Prophecy no calling Pope the Beast no calling other churches no talking about Sunday at the back of the Beast no talking about false prophet it ISC hallelujah amen are you seeing it write it in your not if you still going to these churches that signed and you're still going there look very carefully that you are not in the Church of God you are in the train where the conductor is the devil and the engineer is Po and you are taken deep down to the but because Jesus Christ loves you and me this message for you 3 number that because God love this world this world that the devil come to become a he sent his son Jesus Christ whoever believes in him shallish in churches butal 17 [Music] life etal in the only true God and his son Jesus Christ of gr there was a beginning of the end cry clearly coming out from GC churching swelling swelling and swelling into loud cry [Music] and ifs who are thinking that we are going to preach like this and go back the Church of God will not fall will tur no turning back no compromise is C that and andella so the call to those who are still remaining in this adven churches together with churches is very straight and clear without fear or favor that come out come out so that is very clear and it is without compromise let's continue let's continue the next slide next slide I want you to so we read this one as well that if the church join because that isting neighbor wives because those churches have rejected Christ as theand theil asand so they breaking the seventh commandment of do not commit adultery andon committing adultery when the two Church including the sth Day Adventist Church led by the general conference conference start start converting their neighbor because Pap is not the wife of Christ we read from RE 13 that it is the devil that gives the purp power so the Roman Church is the the Roman Church is wife to the to the devil according toel 1:1 and so if there was a true Church of God this for then that is breaking of the seventh commandment and when you commit in the Book of Matthew that the only thing that can make a husband to divorce his [Music] wife when that woman fornicat commits so when the church when the church started conting the Roman Church is theband of of the Condor which is the [Music] devil warning that church was in of becoming a sister toon because it allowed the churches to become corrupted and every false Spirit andage of every unan and clean and what bread and will will what is and will be clear unless we make a decided what movement movement to cure the existing what so that is why all is coming to cure the existing evil we have made decid and clear movement and this movement must clear and must clear and cure these existing evils by going back to the old foundations and [Music] joining this is 1 2 3 so this church is now with every fall of spirit and C of every unlean and and those things we will only be clear unless we make a decided movement to the existing evil so that is why all this is to cure the existing to be very clear that they don't believe in the trity because that have be very clear that Jesus is the son of God son not drama to De to the world the ho is but the of God is the glory of God is the Breath of God and the only one true God is present everywhere through his holy spirit and that what son that God and his son can live in us through the holy spirit so that that have to make clear have to make it very clear that the burner of the Adventist is not the cross but the the the three Ang have to make it clear no dancing in churches reform there's a medical missionary reform movement Health reform must be given priority among others cure the existing evil Hallelujah Church hallelujah hallelujah how are following let's go because I'm almost finishing so pass there we had read yesterday I this I pass this one again another one another one and another oh

learn all these\n[752.0s] friends we need to pray for Christ\n[757.8s] righte and we need to pray for the Deep\n[760.7s] soul searching and self examination in\n[763.0s] Christ\n[769.2s] Jesus that as we approach this final\n[772.0s] events we may be covered by Christ Jesus\n[775.0s] is theong\n[782.8s] now this video we watch\n[785.6s] yesterday just for just replay it just\n[789.4s] put it again as a a reminder the people\n[793.4s] who might not be might not be\n[798.2s] there might not be there but those who\n[800.3s] are not there\n[804.7s] yesterday and those who are also willing\n[807.8s] to be reminded\n[827.8s] foreign spee\n[839.5s] [Music]\n[849.2s] means if you're born again raise your\n[851.0s] hand if you're born again you're a\n[862.6s] Catholic and split at the end of the\n[865.1s] first Millennium we had the Orthodox\n[866.6s] East and West two Church\n[869.9s] then 500 years later we have Luther his\n[873.0s] protest three churches in 1500 years\n[877.2s] three denominations of three churches\n[880.1s] and then from Luther's protest\n[883.0s] onwards\n[884.9s] 33,000 new\n[889.2s] [Music]\n[891.6s] denominations problem to the Catholic I\n[894.1s] come to understand that diversity is\n[896.0s] divine it's division that's diabolic\n[903.9s] it's true what you were saying about the\n[905.3s] glory I agree with you of course it's\n[906.9s] true the glory that the father had he\n[910.6s] gave to Jesus the glory was the presence\n[913.2s] of God what is the charismatic renewal\n[916.0s] is when we experience the presence of\n[918.4s] God and he said and I give them the\n[922.7s] glory that they may be want\n[931.3s] it's the glory if you accept that Christ\n[933.9s] is living in me and the presence of God\n[935.8s] is in me and the presence of God is in\n[937.8s] you that's all we need because God will\n[940.6s] sort out all our doctrines when we get\n[944.2s] upstairs therefore Christian Unity is\n[946.8s] the basis of our credibility because\n[949.0s] Jesus said until they won they will not\n[951.4s] believe the world will not believe as\n[953.8s] they should Until We Are One Division\n[957.2s] destroys our credibility\n[959.6s] it is fear that keeps us separated\n[961.8s] because fear is false evidence appearing\n[964.1s] real it's an acronym f e a r false\n[967.6s] evidence appearing real because most of\n[969.8s] your fear is based on\n[972.7s] propaganda\n[985.3s] so the isting for The worshipers Who to\n[989.7s] for the\n[996.8s] truth but people the truth refus to to\n[1001.4s] Beed and come\n[1004.8s] together it is Tru that is supposed to\n[1008.7s] the people of\n[1012.5s] God in the gr and brother\n[1017.3s] PR the last being that Christ hanging on\n[1020.5s] the cross\n[1023.5s] beel there is something that should be\n[1026.4s] our\n[1027.2s] do hallelujah\n[1042.6s] hallelujah today people are just talking\n[1044.9s] of UN\n[1055.7s] [Music]\n[1071.0s] yes the world these are denominations\n[1074.5s]

in this adven churches\n[1576.8s] together with\n[1583.3s] churches is very straight and clear\n[1585.9s] without fear or favor\n[1591.5s] that come\n[1595.1s] out come\n[1597.8s] out so that is very\n[1601.6s] clear and it is without\n[1605.7s] compromise let's\n[1607.8s] continue let's continue the next\n[1611.5s] slide next slide I want you to so we\n[1614.6s] read this one as\n[1616.3s] well that if the church\n[1622.8s] join because that isting neighbor wives\n[1626.1s] because those churches have rejected\n[1628.5s] Christ as theand theil\n[1637.3s] asand so they breaking the seventh\n[1639.8s] commandment of do not commit adultery\n[1642.5s] andon committing adultery\n[1649.3s] when the two Church including the sth\n[1651.6s] Day Adventist\n[1655.3s] Church led by the general\n[1658.4s] conference conference start start\n[1662.6s] converting their\n[1667.4s] neighbor because Pap is not the wife of\n[1675.9s] Christ we read from RE 13 that it is the\n[1680.3s] devil that gives the purp\n[1686.8s] power so the Roman Church is\n[1690.1s] the the Roman Church is wife to the to\n[1693.9s] the\n[1698.0s] devil according toel 1:1\n[1704.0s] and so if there was a true Church of God\n[1711.3s] this\n[1716.5s] for then that is breaking of the seventh\n[1722.8s] commandment and when you\n[1727.2s] commit in the Book of\n[1732.5s] Matthew that the only thing that can\n[1735.2s] make a husband to divorce his\n[1739.6s] [Music]\n[1742.0s] wife when that woman fornicat\n[1746.6s] commits so when the\n[1750.1s] church when the church started conting\n[1753.5s] the Roman\n[1756.3s] Church is theband of of the Condor which\n[1760.6s] is the\n[1762.8s] [Music]\n[1764.4s] devil warning that church was in of\n[1768.6s] becoming a sister\n[1773.4s] toon because it allowed the churches to\n[1775.9s] become\n[1779.7s] corrupted and every false Spirit andage\n[1782.3s] of every\n[1784.8s] unan and clean and what bread and\n[1790.4s] will will what is and will be clear\n[1794.5s] unless we make a decided what movement\n[1797.6s] movement to cure the existing what so\n[1800.8s] that is why all is coming to cure the\n[1803.2s] existing\n[1809.6s] evil we have

and\n[1843.6s] [Music]\n[1848.0s] joining this is\n[1858.0s] 1 2\n[1860.0s] 3 so this church is now with every fall\n[1864.2s] of spirit and C of every unlean and and\n[1867.7s] those\n[1871.4s] things we will only be clear unless we\n[1874.1s] make a decided movement to the existing\n[1883.1s] evil so that is why all this is to cure\n[1887.0s] the existing\n[1895.9s] to be very\n[1898.4s] clear that they don't believe in the\n[1904.0s] trity because\n[1907.8s] that have be very\n[1910.4s] clear that Jesus is the son of\n[1915.4s] God son not drama\n[1923.6s] to De to the\n[1926.3s]

        "full_transcript": "prophecy speaker says we will start with them in the next lesson. So this is the next lesson. Soon come I'm forgetting your name. You see I'm wondering but you'll be telling us your name first and then you ask how many do you welcome? Yes. Would you give him a mic of Yes, it's working. Good evening. My name is Baraka and I'm glad to be here. So, I'm much can say confused or uh what term can I use? Yes. But allow me read the book of John chapter 17 verse uh verse 15 before I ask my question. This Jesus praying I pray that thou should shouldest take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from the evil. So uh my question goes to uh the handle topic in the afternoon true education. All of us here I believe you are schooled and uh if not I don't know but for me personally I've uh finished campus 84 system and currently I'm looking for unemployment and uh in the presentations I heard that anyone working or schooling in Babylonian institution in the last days in which we are right now will uh all or parents taking their children to Babylonian schools or institutions will receive the mark of the beast. So I'm asking and this is a very serious question. The book of Daniel chapter one we see Daniel and his brothers taken to Babylon. Nemiah working as a cup bearer in uh in the king's palace. Yes, he was. Daniel and his brothers were in Babylonian king kingdom and they were working in the palace and yet they were faithful. We see Nemiah too working as a cup bearer in the king's palace. So I was asking myself as a saved member uh is it wrong to be employed for example I'm I'm a an accountant and a finance analyst if I'm employed in an institution uh in fact we were told that Babylon and the Rome as has taken over almost every institution sor even the government itself. See if I'm employed in any government institution or non-governmental institution. Is it wrong? That my first question. The second question uh in this room I know the PA system, the laptops, our phones, our dress codes, our everything are made from these institutions. the system, our phones and everything are made from all this. So I'm I'm a little bit confused. So I need much clarification that if indeed uh we are to reform in true education, what line a clear line will will we take or will I take personally? because maybe I've not learned much from other lessons but that was my first lesson and lastly if I get children if I'm married I'm not married if I be married my children what form like when the the seven adventist church began in in in 1863 there were institutions there were sanitariums there were schools in these last days one true god Do we have institutions? Do we have sanitariums? Because if I have a wife, my wife wants to be want to deliver. Will I not take her to a Babylonian oipital or any well will I take her my children all that when they are sick? Not let let me not speak of health reform but let let me speak of other institutions. So even the IT men here all of us we learn these skills there. Even Daniel and the brothers, they learn those skills. They Moses being trained in the king's palace. So that's my question. Thank you. Thank you. Answers the Bible three stories are spiritual. How many answers? 1 2 3 I ask you be short. Yes to the point. Happy happy Sunday. Happy Sunday. Uh thank you. Uh I want to be short and precise but I want to say this as I begin. Let the Bible speak. Uh he has given a case study of Nemiah. Daniel that is where I want us to begin from. Uh if you go to the book of Daniel, let's begin from the book of Daniel chapter 1 so that we get the answer of his question first. Daniel chapter 1 we are beginning from verse number one. Daniel chapter 1 and the verses one. The scripture reads in the third year of the reign of Joakim the king of Judah came the king of Babylon and Jerusalem and besieged it. The Lord gave Joim the king of Judah into his hands with part of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of Shina the house of his God. And he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his God. And the king spake unto Ashpenas the master of the Unix that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and of the king's sin and of the princes. Go to verse four. Read with me and you understand the Bible. Children in whom was no blemish. But Lord favored skillful in all wisdom and turning in knowledge, understanding, science and such had the ability in them to stand in the king's palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongues of the childins. So from that point we get the requirement of Nebuchadzza to Ashenaz concerning the unex whom he was to bring. So the question comes what was they to learn in Babylon? They were to learn the language of the child beans because these people already they had one understanding of wisdom turning in all knowledge and understanding science and such had the ability in them to stand in the king's palace. So they had that you read the book who was the place a book called place in Bible education. Do you have it there? I want I want a hard copy. I only mark in the hard copy. If you go to the book place of Bible education in education bring me the hard copy. I want to read something on that written by Edo Trevia Jones. It will tell you that these people had the understanding from where? Get me the book parts and prophets pay 2 596. Yeah, that's what I want. Help me with it. You come and buy this book. He's only 600 shillings. I want us to read the book place of Bible education. Get me the book parts and prophet page 596. Education of Daniel. Uhhuh. So I want you to read this. Go to chapter 8 of the place of Bible education. Please go with me very fast. That chapter 8 it should be page 67 in this book 596. You read lesson before I read this I want to give the Bible principle alone. So these people were accounting in everything that they required. Okay, let's move to chapter 2 of Daniel uh chapter one sorry. So after that there was a test that this were to pass and that test Daniel and the fellow said don't give us the food from the king's me king's table but give us water and you know the things okay so I want you to prove this verse 12 prove thy servant I beseech thee 10 days and let them give us pulses to eat and water to Then let our countenance be looked upon before thee, and countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat, as thou seeest, deal with thy servants. So he consented with them in this matter and prove them 10 days. Verse 15 is very critical. At the end and at the end of the 10 days the accountants what you can look appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat. One thus took away the portion of their meat and the one that they should drink and gave them passes. As for these four children, God gave them one knowledge, two skills in learning and wisdom. And Daniel had understanding in all vision and dream. Verse 18. Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, the princes the unic brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar and the king communed with them. And among them all was found none like Daniel, Naniah, Michelle and Nazar. Therefore today before the king verse 20 and in all matters all matters is it left out? Is it left out? Is farming left out? What about globe making and dress cutting? What about electrical engineering call it? What about flying aircraft? What is left out in all? Y all is like I'm reading God has the ability to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. So it says and in all matters of what is called wisdom and knowledge and understanding the king inquired that the king inquired of them. He found them 10 times better than all one magicians. Two, three, everyone. So I'm asking this question to you. I'm posing a bit. Listen to my question. Whom do you think were the lecturers in Babylon at this time? I'm reversing the my question again. Whom do you think were the lecturers or the teachers in Babylon at this time teaching and lecturing Daniel, Azariah and Michelle? See the same magicians and astronomers. Okay, that is when you go to Daniel chapter 2, you get that they do not understand why the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God. God is good. Which knowledge do you think you can be 10 times wiser than your lecturer? Yes. Which knowledge do you think you can be 10 times wiser than your parents who are still in Babylon? So where do you think they got this knowledge? Where I want to give you where they got the knowledge. More with me. If you have the book less of Bible education, I want you listen to what I read. Page 68. Now blemish and wellpowered. This will require that they should be physically sound, wellbe and symmetrical. The world trans wisdom, knowledge and science is vers Hebrew is death, murder, pogma and are cruc the second is extension of the first, the third and of the second. So listen. Therefore the requirement of kingzar in selecting of this youth was that they should be physically sound. Is that right? symmetrical belt and that mentally they should be one skillful in deciding what is called valuable knowledge. Do you know what's called valuable knowledge? Do you know what's called valuable knowledge? Huh? The valuable knowledge is this. You have the ability to discern when to plant. Is that a knowledge that is valuable which adds value? Uhhuh. skillful ability to acquire such knowledge turning in the acquisition of knowledge by thinking and application. You get this point. You know many people go to school they think but where to apply is the problem. And I ask you question where do you apply Pythagoras theorem in the real world? Who has been told where to apply Pythagoras theorem in the real world? Yes. Who knows where to apply Pythagoras theorem in the real world? So this is what these people had the ability to discern and acquire that knowledge and where to apply it. Understanding how to correlate, classify, systemize the knowledge which they had faculty discern was valuable knowledge and which they were cunning in gathering. So let me take you where they acquired that knowledge. Go to the book of 1 Samuel. I'm telling them where they acquired the knowledge. as you stand up. 1st Samuel 19:20. Read with me 1st Samuel 19:20. And also 2 Kings 6 1-6. I'm reading that. Then we just finish. Yes. Yeah. And Saul sent messengers to take David. And when they saw the company of the prophets Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So then we just stop there. So it's this there was the schools of the prophets before these children of Israel were c were taken captive. So this all knowledge that was revealed in the Babylonian as a country by then was acquired in the schools of the prophets. Two, these men were living under the guidance of their parents. Okay? So their parents were building a character within heaven. So there's a part of a parent to play in character building. Read me that PP 596. PP 596. We are I'm done with my answer. PP 596. Just start from paragraph one. Uh-huh. Mhm. Mhm. The great life work of life is character building. In the knowledge of God is the foundation of all true education to impart this knowledge and to know the character in the knowledge with heat. So the object of teachers work is that. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Mhm. Go to go to page 595. Uhhuh. Yes. 59. Let me read. It says uh le in the in the days of 593 paragraph 2. In some days there were two schools. One at Rama the home of the prophets another at Jerim where the ark then was others were established in their times. The people of this school sustain themselves by their own labor in tilling the land. So one we need to study what is called ABC education tilling the land or in some mechanical employment. Uhhuh. In Israel it was thought strange or degrading. Indeed, it was regarded as a crime to allow children to grow up in ignorance of useful labor. By the command of God, every child was storm some trade. Uhhuh. Even though he was to be educated for holy office. So the main object of education in Israel was for what? Redemption. And holy office was to preserve for them. But as far as that, they were also to do what is called mechanical work, toiling the land. Last many of the religious teachers supported themselves by manual labor even so late as the time of the apostle Paul and Achil Aquilia no less honored because they earn lively by their trade of dent making. So that is it. Okay. Welcome. The next person who is coming just to be shorting myself in the Are you coming to preach? I want us to be very short because if I want to ask questions and you take 20 minutes please. So I will be doing something there. something too many. You just say this, this this maybe tomorrow. Praise God. Uh I'm going to answer I think one question that uh should I be employed by the government if I believe the truth may okay let us go to the book of proverbs chapter 22. The main reason why people are being employed number one people want to live a good life, riches, wealth and hope and honor in the society. 22 of Proverbs read verse 4. It says by and so those three things that that matter so much in the life of any person living they are being got by to the fear of the lord and the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge now I want to answer the second one should I train it we talk about we have children where should we take them to learn something like that. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah. That one I'm going to take you to the book of the same same book. Proverbs 22 verse number six. It says train up where you should go. Uhhuh. So train up a child. uh I don't know if this instruction was given to the teachers in the school but I think the same as parents and uh that includes fathers and and mothers you brought a study of um a study of uh about uh Daniel and the the three Hebrew brothers I think I remaining with one minute I I will just give you a book there's a book known has story of Daniel the prophet. There is a a chapter or written a true education and uh I will not read everything. I will explain for you so you go and read uh after the announcement by prophet Isaiah that the Babylonians will be be coming to this city to destroy it and to take some of the vessels of God to their land. Mothers and the parents who were who heard about this started teaching their kids the sin the history of Israel were studied and the story of Nadab and Abihu was told and retold. They were being taught through songs and also they were being also taught about the effect of health uh bad health in the family like the effect of strong dream was impressed upon the mind. the laws of his own being was studied. He knew that excess in eating and drinking will s the mind that the voice of God could not be heard. I'm I'm still looking a text that will tell me that Daniel was was employed in Babylon. I think it was a forced labor. Was there that Daniel was employed and was receiving a certain amount of money every month? I think is there it was employed but receiving amount of money building even houses even ordering some cars from abroad so I'm still looking for that verse if there is then Daniel was employed in Babylon and receiving yes teacher of education come will be all of you cannot answer this questions amen You can only ask another one. I'm going to be very brief. The first verse that was read is John 17:15 that says that keep them from evils of the what? The world is is what it that they in the world but need they need to be kept from the evils of the what? It says out of the world. Out of the world. The first principle to keep somebody out of the evil is to separate him from the the world. Number two, there's a question that has been asked about Daniel commented on it. I want just read a quotation on where Daniel obtained his education. So that when we are talking about number one need to know that those people where they education I'm reading place of the Bible in education page 80 paragraph one very fast says that the specification distinctly made in the scriptures so it should be projected place of Bible in education page 80 paragraph one very fast it reads Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Mhm. Mhm. Uh-huh. Mhm. It is not small tribute to the educational ideas. Indeed, this view of education as the Bible as shown in the vers of the Bible were for all practical what purposes advance of the educational system. Fine and advance educational system. By the way, what required from those people was advanced education that the one that exists today. Read the next statement. Even the leading college and universities of the United States. So what was even higher than the education that was providing the universities and colleges of United what? States. Yet yet Daniel Daniel successfully were able successfully such to pass such an examination where then they said such education that exceeded even the education that was provided in the university. Uhhuh. But me you the answer to this question the answer to this question is worth having. worth having besides besides we need it just now for all this for last days. Next paragraph where then you see people says that Daniel were taken to what to learn what Babylon get this get this where then Daniel and his three companions the education enabled them successfully to pass them skillful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and science. All these things withoutation it can be answered in a school. In the schools of what? So during the times of prophets there was a what? A school. Read the divinely established school. The divinely established school in what? So in Israel there was a school established. Continue reading. There was that that time a school of the what? In Jerusalem. in Jerusalem. So we need to understand that the the likes of Daniel I could have read many things but the lack of Daniel obtained an education in the university on Israel. Okay. Number two. Number two. 1 28 paragraph 2 says that God's purpose in giving the third angel's message. God's purpose in giving the angels message to the world to prepare people to stand true to him during the investigative what? Judgment. This is the purpose for which we establish and maintain our publishing houses. Our what? Our schools, our sanitariums, hygienic restaurants, treatment what? treatment rooms and factories factories. This is our purpose in carrying forward the work in every word every life. Okay. So God's purpose to carry the message is that we have our own what our own school. Hallelujah. The last thing I'm saying is that not all the knowledge that is in the world is unnecessary. Are we together? What Satan is doing is mingling truth and and air. You go to place of Bible education, you realize that even in our schools where we have to maintain this in our schools there are things that we have to teach. One of them language must be taught, geography must be taught, must be taught anatomy and physiology must be music must be done what must be taught. Amen. And therefore when the Lord has brought a knowledge that will help in carrying on the gospel, that knowledge will be accepted by God's people, God's people. So long as that knowledge will not confuse them the mind and lead to what to say. Amen. Others will be handled in the next lesson in Jesus name. You want to answer or you want to ask a question? Question is coming. Yes. this many hands. Put your hands down like you ask the question still being answered. Yes. The context for my question. The context for my question was is it wrong to be to study or to be employed in that institution? Not the not the what being taught is wrong because I think the there should be a simultaneous application whereby parents can teach the way Daniel and the others were taught and then that the knowledge from home will help them to survive in those so my questioning me and I go and work there is it just to go and work or is it wrong just leaving it wrong? So that means those who be answering the questions you don't even note them down you love answering you don't note you don't yes amen so note the questions so that you may not come and don't answer now who want to answer that if you have noted so that you may not come and start out a study till the somebody who ask a question is wondering am I being answered Yes, but at least you have gotten that Daniel did not go to Babylon to study. In fact, Daniel chapter one is written that he had all knowledge and wisdom. By the way, they had everything while with us we are going to school to acquire those knowledge. But they all all knowledge wisdom full of science all things and in fact it is written that the knowledge wanted cannot even be found in University of United States. So that means those people went there when already that prepared. The question was where did they get the education they got it from the what back at their home somebody came here who read that they were taught even health at home. Even their standing with health message in Daniel in Babylon was not an accident. It was not what an is the first principle. Even when you are going to be answered going to work there. Number two, it was also a command of God that let them go to Babylon. Remember God told Jeremiah said that those who will refuse will be killed. But again, our command now is not to go to Babylon. It is to come out of Babylon. Our command is different. Their command was to go bon all of you that y is coming put your y ours is to come out of so we have to look line upon line the other line and this line and connect somebody to come and ask yes yes felix come and then we are you will the rest will answer the next questions is still the same so thank you you take 2 minutes yes go is I want to read one verse. 1 Corinthians 6:17 I think says that 6:17 verse from verse 14 very fast the Bible reads the praise of the Lord is it second or 2 Corinthians 6:14 the Bible reads be not equally y together with unbelievers both fellowship as righteousness or unrighteousness Yes. What is what communion as light with darkness? So who is unbeliever do not be collect together with unbeliever. Who is unbeliever? Who is unbeliever? So we cannot we cannot be united with someone in business transaction. White says that we cannot even be united in business transaction with those who do not believe what with those who do not believe the the present. So it is wrong. It is wrong to be employed in such a school in in in worldly employment because they are unbelievers. You cannot work among them because you have a precious truth. So I wanted to read read the last quote education page 77. says that where Christ also receive his education so we are not to be employed by worldly as I read that I am quoting great controversy page 491.2 2 says that while men will be absorbed in business pursuit their probation will be what? Closing. Amen. So you cannot be employed in worldly institution if you have these truths. Page 77.1 I think the value of principle. No I want to read the last last statement says that education directly from heaven. Now listen where we need to obtain directly from heaven appointed sources. Gain directly from appointed sources. This education was gained direct directly from heaven appointed sources. From useful work. Number one useful useful work from the study of the scriptures. Study of the B of study of the scriptures of nature. Nature and from the experience of life. The experience of what? Those are the four syllabus. So we are not going to be employed by the word useful work scriptures nature. Amen. I think I'm done. So as uh as comes the simple answer is you can put [Music] here there will be a direct answer to your question. It is very direct. You you have to come forward. Can we allow come forward? Just come forward so that we maybe maybe Yes. Okay, good evening. My question is on it was yesterday that Kosg was teaching about talents and he was saying that if you abandon one bar one talent you be responsible for it isn't it that so I'm asking there is an example you give that if you have a talent of business and the same time you are for farming And business if you can come to the real world business is mostly empowered with worldly things. So if I abandon those business that is associated with worldly things and go to farming which is not which is useful and not worldly. So will life be responsible for that? And the another question is there is this practical institutions that we go and learn something like maybe construction of our own houses. Are they bad? And if they are bad, which way forward? And I think the last question is this or these items we are using here even cooking are made from the worldly instructions and if we shall stop using them and maybe return to the maybe if it is cooking we return to ports. So I hope from tomorrow we will be cooking using pots not free if it is. Thank you. Good evening. We thank God for all these privileges to be together to share these messages and we hope the Lord is leading us. One thing I believe is that the Lord wants us to be balanced in everything and to follow the voice of truth and make decisions. Amen. So I know the questions that the brother ask us the last questions uh let me begin with the other one first though brother Maxwell has promised that he will blow something there which will solve everything uh on the question but let me give my view as a people as we stand today as the teacher for true education has said we have lost our birthight you know we sold it Um those people who followed our pioneers they sold us away. They never maintained our schools. We had Lalinda, we had Madison school, we had Battle Creek Colleges. These places were superior. If you study the history of the great depression, economic depression in 1929, when the secretary of education of the United States of America visited Madison school, he said, \"All American schools should be ordered in this manner.\" They were running in the best way possible that any government school will wish to run. We sold it away. We lost it. What we are doing in this generation is we are crying out for restoration of those places. So this voice that is crying right now is not pointing us at a place where we have but saying we have lost it, we want to regain it. Amen. So by saying those places have a problem is a voice calling that we should go back to something which we must do practically not just by words. So when we said those places are evil let me just put it now in a few words after saying that my brother has already said not everything in the world is negative. The problem is that there is a mingling of error and what and truth. And the Lord wants us to establish places where we can find truth in its purity. That's the thing. And we want to move there slowly. We don't want to speak as though we already have the places. No, we are heading to that direction. And that's our cry as a people. So, brother, we do not have such places. The Lord wants us to establish such a places and we are beginning that work first by accepting that we have missed the point and now we can begin from here going towards that direction and for our children we are making preparations so that they will not be partakers of these places. I'm speaking because my child is not yet of age. For those whose children are of age, they have already made a decision to begin doing it. You get the point. So and as a church we must take up this work and lead it to the father's place. Um one still one example suffer me brother. Uh Hezekiah when he was visited by the ambassadors from Babylon they were Ezekiah was supposed to tell them about the true God right and how he had gotten healed. But instead he showed him all the things that he had. And the Lord said, \"The days are coming when your children, even born of yourself, shall be taken to Babylon. Shall they shall be made unax, and they shall serve the king.\" So Daniel and his friends never served in Babylon because they they loved it. No, it was not that way. God really gave them privileges because they respected God. So that the king of Babylon treated them with favors. But see, they were made unox. Do you know what that means? They were castrated. Think about that. Can anyone go to school to be castrated? No. No. No. No. I really don't think so. They never served out of their own willingness. And if we are going to serve out of our own willingness, you realize that we are selling ourselves. So I will say personally in this regard, I'm sorry. I am just re finding it hard to summarize this thing because I found the question so heavy. Should I end it there or I still say something? Two minutes more just two more minutes. So what I wanted to say is these things that we are using here are not evil. We studied yesterday. We realized that the spirit of invention that gift comes from who? From the Lord. It may be misaligned but can't we if we install this system of education can't we be able also to even invent such things I'm persuaded if the adventist never lost that we will be very far much ahead of the world for sure we will be the ones doing these things and not going there to acquire that knowledge you get the point higher than the highest human thought is God's ideal is God's ideal for his children And that's it. Now the rest of the questions the brother has asked I still have lessons in my class and especially what he said I will capture it because I will be talking about what sections of businesses and what sections of works we can engage. Some of them are secular but acceptable. You get the point and some are Christian in practice. I mean they are gospel like running a publishing place. It makes money yet it is for gospel reasons. But if you are a Mason, it's not heralding the gospel proper but it is innocent. That one is not evil. So I'll talk about those businesses in my series on classes. So let me just end it there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you brother for you will be answered. Even a education is not ended brother. If you come every day again this one now this is GCDP s your question is direct GCDB is general conference bulletin do you believe the spirit of prophecy yes I believe let's read because a question worth asking. If my money belongs to the world, yes, do I belong to the church? Uhhuh. If my abilities are put to the work of the world as of the world of the church as of the church then the Christian consider I belong to the church myself that our attention the Christian how much it cost me how much And it is a question worth asking. If my money belongs to the world, do I belong to the church? If my talent, my abilities are put into the work of the world as of the world and not the work of the church as of the church. The question is worth considering. Do I belong to the church myself? That turns our attention to the question, how much does it take to compose me? How much is there of a man? Do you have a man here at this faculty yonder is about in another place and the fruit of f of his faculty, the fruit of his abilities, the result of his life and endeavor in yet another place. Could that be the man be here? All of him. No sir. All my faculties, all the fruits of my life must wear. If I myself am to be there. We cannot escape that then do I belong to the church? Do I? That is the question. Does 75,000 uh 7th Adventist belong to the church? 75,000 700 belongs to the church. Do we that is the question to illustrate. So get illustration get illustration. Do all these people who are sitting here belong to this channel? That is the question. So illustration now to illustrate illustrate now listen suppose I have my name on the church book belong to the church I'm a school teacher and I'm spend all my time all my endeavor all my ability all my faculty as a school teacher in the world school teaching and teaching in the world school the world's in the world's way the world's education it is worth asking do I belong to the church am I loving the church and giving myself whatever I may profess my faculty my life what am I in the ability which god has given me I am giving it to the world for the world's work and the world's purpose that is so that I am loving the church and give myself do I belong the church suppose I am a physician and I give my ability my talent my faculties my life and I the world's way of what is called medicine the world's way of treating diseases. I stand as a member of the church as belong to the church. I am to be sanctified and cleansed the washing of water with the word of God and that word of God that is given to the church the divine the true system medical treatment the true philosophy and treatment with regard to health disease right living and all these things. I belong to the church to be sanctified and cleansed the washing of water by that word. Instead of doing what that word gives to me to which I am committed as belonging to the church, I take that world gives and devote to the world. What which I get from the world and I belong to the church. Do I? I belong to the church for the purpose of being sanctified. Is that making us not to get this? Okay. I belong to the church for the purpose of being sanctified and cleansed with the washing of water by the word of God to the church. There is in that word and that word itself is a system of education. That is the true and the only true education. I say I belong to the church but I'm satisfied with the world's education with the world's system of education with the world's philosophy of education and I devote my life to that I want to know do I really belong to the church it is precisely I think these things would not get this cuz they are not consequence like that no no now repeat this one there's in that one and Yeah, there is that word and that word itself is a system of education. That is the true that is the only true education. I say I belong to the church but I'm satisfied with the world's education, the world's system education, the world's philosophy education. I devote my life to that. I want to know do I really belong to the church? It is precisely so also as to medical or any other profession. So all processions you can have you take somebody also to get saying taking six days in the pagan institution and one day then you only have a day somebody to get that I still continue and I am a man of other affairs in the world whether it be business or farming or carpenter work I mean the every commercial business world I stand as belong to the church and the efforts which I put forth of thought or endeavor the blessings of God upon it all increase comes. I put it in the worldly bank. I'm not a speculator. I belong to the church. But here is the means God has given to me as a member of the church and I put it into the worldly bank. I loan it to the worldly men to be used in worldly business instead of in the work of the church to which I belong. Then it is fair question for me to ask do I belong to the church? This reference to illustrate. And now there's not one here of these delegates. delegates. You are in the delegates India. The delegates in the land are enough to illustrate. And now there's not one here of these delegates who cannot look all over this land and see thousands upon thousands 7th Adventist who stand in a position as belonging to the church. Which leaves a wide open question for you and to ask. Do I belong to the church? And everyone here knows that if all seven of the adventists in the United State from this day and forward who really belong to the church, you yourself will confess that there is no question at all but that this message could be given to the world in this generation. You can only why this message cannot go now to the church but we are in church. a world person in where the church but not a member and a you can all say amen to that. You know that that is so then you see you going to say amen but you know it is so and then you see brethren the problem is not difficult. The problem is not difficult. It is just this question to be decided. It is not difficult. This issue of education is not what it is just this question to be what decided by it is just to be discussed by each one or himself. The youth must decide for himself. Do I belong to the church? You are going to come out of this meeting. You can work in the world. But again, do you and Christ is coming to take the church. Christ is coming to take a church. Do I belong to the church? Where next? Oh now shall I not shall not I find myself my faculties or my means wrapped up in the work of the world used in behalf of the world or engage the world's work shall not I will not you wall it away from there and put the church's work in the course of the church in the earth to which I belong let that be done and you know that spiritually it will shake this worlds out of its place think of it if only seventh advent in the United States would really consider this allow the church give themselves with their children give their themselves with their children do you know why our schools are failing when they began education where is the money of the advent going the world even these schools who who building who are in the who are board members who are the teachers there are they members of this church those who are teaching in the worldly schools Do we have members in our church here and in our school? What if these talents were used in the church? What if all these talents all were used in the church now and it says yes let that be done and you know that spiritually it will shake this world out of its place. Think of it. If all seven adventists in United States really consider this, love the church, give themselves with their children for the church and to the church, how would our schools work stand? Imagine if all of us it will be stand where it ought and such consecration as that will bring such power from heaven that the teaching will be saved will be easy. The lack of teachers will not be such as it is now. So now we don't even have teachers. We even collect things that should not be collected. Hallelujah. You collect those who have talent in the world. Hallelujah. They know how to teach best. You would have not lacked teachers. The Latin teachers will not be such a hindist. No. And so with all the rest, if all seven day Adventist in the land will turn their families and Christian education and all our families, if we can turn our families to Christian education and the education that becomes the church and education that becomes the church and the world is calling for the church to give. The world is calling the church to give that education. And because he has just said in 1929 somebody went where to to the medicine and said this is the what see and now shall I not find myself and my faculties or my mean grabs in the work of the world use the world or engage in the work world's work shall I not shall not I will not you w away from there and put the child's work elites cause of the charge in the earth to which I belong. Somebody's joking here. He's not with us. Yes. Be with us. Please be in church. Be church. Amen. And so with all the rest, if all the seven in the land will turn their families under Christian education, education that that becomes the church and that the world is calling for the church to give and for the want of which and because of the lack of which the world itself is saying that the church in education is a distinctly diminishing quantity. If this were done, the world would easily be rich in this generation. So how can the world be rich in this generation? only through what? There's no way we can reach them. Not through crusades. Okay. If we do crusades and we don't have the true education, we rather stop preaching cuz we are forming churches that are going to be Babylon again. What has made the general content to be Babylon is because of the education of the world. Amen. It is time that there should be one church in the world that will rise and be not a mission quoted in education but be the whole thing in education. If the seventh day Adventist will really give themselves the church loving it giving themsel for it with all their talents all their means all their powers then the whole problem will be solved. So why do we have a problem? There are people inside this movement but they have refused to be the church members and that is why we have a problem will come again. People want to be united. We talk we talk of unity and by the way that book says that in 1860s the church was busy talking of unity and organization while their children were going to the what? World education. That was the problem including the daughter of the prophet when when he died the children of public school came and uh sland says that was the problem. They were busy talking of church organization unity we need to come together unity. What are we talking about now? See unity and organization but they are saying true education was to bring what? Unity. Unity. So it is the same. This is the problem we have. Some people in here but they're not church members. They not church members. That is the only problem. It is the problem is not management. People are not church members. says if the seventh adventist will really give themselves to the church loving it, giving themselves for it with all their talents, all their means, all their powers, then the whole problem will be solved. The world facilities are abandoned. In brother Daniel's discourse last night that was presented to us all, brother Conrad today showed how the fields are open and all ready and the harvest. The prophecies a convention like we are. Uh-huh. The prophecies so abundant show that abundant by the way the prophecies we have been learning here talking of what see schools I will show you the commandments in schools now they look the so prophecies are what so abundant showing that now there's time that have been presented let these people present ourselves to Christ today loving the church, being the church, giving ourselves for it, giving ourselves for the church. This people I say present ourselves to Christ as his church. to love that church, to give ourel for it and to give ourel to it with all our you are not even reading these things with all efforts all the effort of whatsoever kind Uh-huh it will be as sweet was before this will be a holy church. So what will make a holy church? When we give ourselves for the church to the church and in the church and for the church and to the church this will be only not having a wrinkle or any such thing the church the pill and the ground of I will study student who always teach what the church is do you tell them about this education church without a wrinkle see amenal amen is this church having a wrinkle and spot serious the church is the pill on the ground and that was what in 2021 we were in this hall and that is where organization started was I want my church back oh and this was the this was this was 1 Timothy 3:14 and 15 it was look at that church is the church is the mill and the ground the support that the stay of the truth in the world the only means by this world can ever obtain truth is by the church. By the church. It may be that the church like the church of Israel and Judah will not of itself voluntarily spread that truth abroad to the world. The people may like Israel and Judah shut themselves within themselves. Shut themselves within themselves and turn the truth of God away, put other things in its place, shut themselves away from the world and thus fail to give it to the world. But if that must be so, then that church will be scattered. So this church is going to be scattered again as was Israel as was Judah amongst the nation of heathen and they in oppression and in bondage. So that is how Adventist found themselves in 201 will find the truth through the church. So whichever way it may be the only way that the nation can get the truth is from the church. So imagine see we took our children and they were scattered in the bondage but still truth came even in those universities did they get those truths people got it in other way if you joke and you think you escaping Please. Amen. Why don't you say amen? Amen. The only way that God's truth can preach the nation is through the church. Church. Therefore, This is how it is that the church of Christ who is the body of the c of Christ is the bail and the ground the support and the stay of the truth in the world. It is that which keeps alive the truth in the earth. Yes. How then how then can the world obtain the truth from me from me as of the church of the church when all my effort listed this question this question sister is going but he will come back and check it. Amen. Yes. This is important question. Yes. Read it together. How then can the world obtain the truth from me as of the church? The church. When all my efforts, all your efforts are enlisted. Are what? Enlisted. Uhhuh. And spend the world's occupation. My brother, are you seeing this? How then can the world bring good from you when 6 days you are employed in Lala community as of the church? As of the church. Then all my efforts, all your efforts are enlisted. What? Enlisted. Uh-huh. and spent in the world's occupation and in the world's philosophy of occupation. Can that be done? Can that be done? No. Sir, the world cannot see the church in me. The world will not see the church in church in that condition of things. In order for the truth to reach the world by me, who am of the church, it is essential that I shall do the work as the work of the church. Do huh the work as of the church. talking so that we may not get in order for the in order for the worldh in order for the truth to reach the world by me by me who am of the church who am of the church it is essential that I shall do the work as the work of the church the work as the work of the church if I am a farmer if and I think even in farming you will be Amen. If I am a farmer of the church. Hallelujah. Amen. Farmer. Amen. Farm pumpkin. And then you saying you are of the church beans. This is the whole of my beams now. If I'm a teacher, if I'm a what? A teacher. If I'm a teacher, I am a teachers of the church. I'm a teacher of the church. A representative of the church. A representative of the church. I do my work as the work of the church. I do my work as the work of the church. Therefore, therefore this calls that every one of us who profess to belong to the church shall so really belong to the church that everything in our lives everything in our lives in our actions in our actions everything that comes in the course of our lives shall be distinctly of the church was that how pioneers were pioneers among working in the world he was a lecturer and also a pioneer Okay. It reads, \"Huh, therefore, therefore, this cause that everyone of us who profess to belong to the church shall so really belong to the church that everything in our lives in our actions, everything that comes in the course of our lives shall be distinctly of the church shall relate to the church and we will hold it up the glory of God as of the church.\" this the last one. Then then that church will be so filled with the truth and will be so sanctified by the truth with which she is filled that the glory of God which is in that truth will shine forth. The world will see her that glorious church which will be discussed everywhere by the world. That church that everything is for the church. You teach us the church. The glory of the Lord shall be seen upon thee. The word will be fulfilled that she shall rise and shine for our light is come and the glory of the Lord and the Lord is risen upon her. You know that is so now all these only to have said in other words that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall begin to sound. The mist of God shall be fulfilled as he and declare to his son the prophets. That mystery of God finished is the gospel preached to all the world that the end may come. That ministry of God is finished in the world is the work of God finished in preaching the gospel to the nation. And it is more than that. Along with that, the mystery of God is God manifest in the flesh. The finished mystery of God is the completion the perfection of the manifestation of God in the flesh in the believers in Jesus who belong to the church. Thus there are two place occupied in the finishing of the mystery of God. One place in the world itself to which the gospel is to be preached, the other place in the lives of the believers of the truth. We might preach and proclaim in words to the ends of the earth to every soul on earth in our generation. So that phase of the work will be completed will be finished. Yet if the manif manifestation of God in the lives of those who preach that is not completed also we could be that thing 10,000 years and the end will never come. It is not simply yet if the manifestation of God in the lives of those who preach that is not completed also we could preach that thing 10,000 years and the end will never come. is not simply that the gospel shall be preached to all the world and fill all the world but it is that when it is done there shall be a people ready to meet at the hand without the finishing of the manifestation of God in the flesh of each believer there can be no finishing of the mystery of God that mystery finished God manifest the flesh mark it means that only God is to be seen in every act of life or believer so that in his life God is manifest only that is the finish of the mystery of God in the way that it counts and you know that if that way were open and God would take position and fill the lives of the 25,000 professed believers today it would be the easiest thing in the world to reach all the nation so that end you know the mystery of God is Christ in you the hope of glory then the finished mystery of God is the finishing of the growth the manifestation of Christ the believer So that we shall stand in this world in the image of Jesus Christ reflecting only him. That when the believers when the believers shall be seen only Christ will be seen. Everything that is said, everything that is done, every tone of voice, all that we are will only of Christ only. That is the finish of the mystery of God in truth in the way that it counts. And that is what has to come before the end can come. That is a child that presents to himself. Hallelujah. Are we far away from are we do you think we are going to make but we are we thank God we are in the line. We are going what is it? What is it? Christian studies in Christian education by EA Southerntherland. [Music] We can decide to be employed. It is our choice. The youth must decide for himself. But again, uh you have seen in your own word. By the end of the call here, we are going to make a call for those who want to be church members. By the way, Vuko, do you think we are going to make it? This is the problem. It is it is the biggest problem. So these talents which are being taught if they're not going to be of church they nothing have influence now read this loudly what's used is the preaching of the gospel today while six days out of seven paganis to get the intellect. What use is the preaching of the gospel on one week? One one day of the week while six days out of the seven paganism guys the intellect. That is why the school calls that those who are in the pagan system of education if they worship it is form of what? Godliness. I hope you used to do it best in West of God. That is why many people have gotten lost today. They were so powerful in church. Unless God help us. By the way, without the help of God, nobody can be found. But God is trying so much. Now every preaching of the gospel in one day of the week. One day of the week Sabbath while six days out of the seven paganism guys the intellect. Why dreaming of heaven or spend Why is it doing what? Dreaming of heaven or spend money to procelite. Money to pro money to proite means money to do what? To preach. So question why of what uses the preaching of the gospel on one day of the week while six days out of seven paganism guys the intellect why is she dreaming of heaven or spend money to proite while pagan education leads your own children by the hand okay even your children again weaves about their find a network of theories which blind their eyes to spiritual truths or students wake up to study how many dogs how many teeth does a dog have many dogs evolution there's wait in the word of the pres president ha of Chicago university say it is difficult to prophesy what the result of our present method education the youth will be in 50 Yes, we are training the mind in our public school. But the moral side of the child's nature is almost entirely neglected. The Roman Catholic cons insist on remedying the this manifest evil. But our Protestant churches seems to ignore it completely. They expect the Sunday school to make good oral public school live and die. And the consequence is that we will look at danger as real as us as any we had to face. Imagine that is what parents are doing to us. You need to teach why you in discipline is this one of use and then you school teachers next time on I think if a parent has refused getting this there's no need of bringing those children to come and destroy people's children who are struggling. Hallelujah. Times when may God help us. I don't want to talk much these things. I I don't want to rob them their power in Jesus name. Amen. We s over these things. Do you know one of the signs of the last days when Christ was about to go to heaven, he used to tell his disciples that I will be arrested, persecuted and on the third day and they were sad and after the sec few hours they were fighting for who is greatest. So one of the says that one of the we need to study closely the life of Jesus especially in the last week is final scene final scene is that the things will be taught to the people of God and then after 3 days and then next time and then the following that Sign of the last days something for few minutes I know please God has given this ministry powerful message and those who would want to go to heaven will have to separate let me tell you the pioneers did a great work some were teachers some were medical missionaries they ate and they were working all their money that the money they were getting was for the work of God and their families did not sleep hungry today we don't believe in that in churches some like in Nairobi and other places is they taught that oh Daniel the same word of Daniel it is being used by the GC the pray for us there's a announcement in our people want to be taken managers so manag don't dream of heaven that is those are not my words so sum Amen. Even if all even if we are going to get lost but the name of God is glorified. Amen. That is called he tells he was praying when we were starting young evangelist. You remember that old one who came said even if I get lost let the name of God be what? glorified that grace of God was sufficient to me and I rejected. So, Amen. Don't dream of heaven. I wish no heaven in Jesus name. Other questions tomorrow in Jesus name or any time the committee will decide to put questions and answer. Was the question good? Is there somebody who has made a step? May God help us in Jesus. Who from those questions? Who has a special prayer for God's grace?

        "timestamped_transcript": "[13.7s] prophecy speaker says we will start with\n[17.0s] them in the next lesson. So this is the\n[20.0s] next lesson.\n[24.3s] Soon\n[27.2s] come I'm forgetting your name. You see\n[29.8s] I'm\n[30.6s] wondering but you'll be telling us your\n[32.9s] name first and then you ask how many do\n[36.0s] you\n[36.7s] welcome? Yes. Would you give him a mic\n[39.2s] of\n[53.5s] Yes, it's working.\n[60.6s] Good evening.\n[62.7s] My name is Baraka and I'm glad to be\n[66.2s] here. So, I'm much can say\n[71.1s] confused or uh what term can I use? Yes.\n[76.3s] But allow me read the book of John\n[77.8s] chapter 17 verse\n[81.6s] uh verse 15 before I ask my\n[84.6s] question. This Jesus praying I pray that\n[87.2s] thou should shouldest take them out of\n[90.3s] the world but that thou should keep them\n[94.2s] from the evil.\n[98.2s] So uh my question goes to uh the handle\n[103.2s] topic in the afternoon true\n[105.3s] education. All of us here I believe you\n[107.8s] are schooled and uh if not I don't know\n[111.8s] but for me\n[113.2s] personally I've uh finished campus 84\n[118.0s] system and currently I'm looking for\n[120.4s] unemployment and uh in the\n[123.5s] presentations I heard\n[125.6s] that anyone working or schooling in\n[129.4s] Babylonian\n[130.8s] institution in the last days in which we\n[133.3s] are right now will\n[136.8s] uh all or parents taking their children\n[139.9s] to Babylonian schools or institutions\n[143.0s] will receive the mark of the beast. So\n[145.6s] I'm\n[147.8s] asking and this is a very serious\n[150.1s] question. The book of Daniel chapter one\n[152.2s] we see Daniel and his brothers taken to\n[155.7s] Babylon. Nemiah working as a cup\n[158.4s] bearer in uh in the king's palace. Yes,\n[162.6s] he was. Daniel and his brothers were in\n[165.1s] Babylonian king kingdom and they were\n[167.7s] working in the palace and yet they were\n[170.4s] faithful. We see Nemiah\n[173.2s] too working as a cup bearer in the\n[176.8s] king's palace.\n[178.7s] So I was asking\n[180.8s] myself as a saved member\n[185.8s] uh is it wrong to be\n[190.1s] employed for example I'm I'm a an\n[193.0s] accountant and a finance\n[195.6s] analyst if I'm employed in an\n[197.8s] institution\n[201.4s] uh in fact we were told that Babylon and\n[205.9s] the Rome as has taken over almost every\n[210.5s] institution sor even the government\n[213.4s] itself. See if I'm employed in any\n[216.5s] government institution or\n[217.4s] non-governmental institution. Is it\n[219.4s] wrong? That my first question. The\n[221.5s] second question uh in this room I know\n[225.1s] the PA system, the laptops, our phones,\n[227.4s] our dress codes, our everything are made\n[231.0s] from these\n[233.0s] institutions. the system, our phones and\n[236.2s] everything are made from all\n[238.1s] this.\n[240.7s] So I'm I'm a little bit confused. So I\n[244.6s] need much\n[245.7s] clarification that if indeed uh we are\n[249.7s] to reform in true education, what line a\n[253.4s] clear line will will we take or will I\n[256.3s] take personally? because maybe I've not\n[258.8s] learned much from other lessons but that\n[261.0s] was my first\n[262.1s] lesson\n[263.7s] and lastly if I get children if I'm\n[267.4s] married I'm not married if I be married\n[270.2s] my\n[272.4s] children what\n[274.2s] form like when the the seven adventist\n[277.8s] church began in in in 1863 there were\n[281.4s] institutions there were sanitariums\n[283.1s] there were\n[284.0s] schools in these last days one true god\n[287.0s] Do we have institutions? Do we have\n[288.4s] sanitariums? Because if I have a wife,\n[290.6s] my wife wants to be want to deliver.\n[292.7s] Will I not take her to a Babylonian\n[295.8s] oipital or any well will I take her my\n[299.8s] children all that when they are sick?\n[302.1s] Not let let me not speak of health\n[304.7s] reform but let let me speak of other\n[307.9s] institutions. So even the IT men here\n[312.1s] all of us we learn these skills there.\n[315.3s] Even Daniel and the brothers, they learn\n[317.8s] those skills. They Moses being trained\n[319.3s] in the king's palace. So that's my\n[322.2s] question.\n[324.0s] Thank you.\n[328.6s] Thank\n[333.0s] you.\n[335.7s] Answers the Bible three stories are\n[341.2s] spiritual. How many answers? 1\n[348.8s] 2 3 I ask you be short. Yes to the\n[361.9s] point.\n[364.8s] Happy happy\n[367.1s] Sunday. Happy\n[369.2s] Sunday. Uh thank you. Uh I want to be\n[373.5s] short and precise but I want to say this\n[377.4s] as I\n[378.5s] begin. Let the Bible speak. Uh he has\n[382.2s] given a case study of\n[384.4s] Nemiah.\n[386.3s] Daniel that is where I want us to begin\n[390.1s] from. Uh if you go to the book of\n[393.3s] Daniel, let's begin from the book of\n[394.9s] Daniel chapter 1 so that we get the\n[397.3s] answer of his question first. Daniel\n[400.6s] chapter\n[401.5s] 1 we are beginning from verse number\n[406.1s] one. Daniel chapter 1 and the verses\n[409.4s] one. The scripture reads in the third\n[412.9s] year of the reign of Joakim the king of\n[415.7s] Judah came the king of Babylon and\n[418.5s] Jerusalem and besieged it. The Lord gave\n[422.0s] Joim the king of Judah into his hands\n[424.2s] with part of the vessels of the house of\n[426.0s] God which he carried into the land of\n[428.2s] Shina the house of his God. And he\n[431.4s] brought the vessels into the treasure\n[433.5s] house of his God. And the king spake\n[436.2s] unto Ashpenas the master of the Unix\n[439.7s] that he should bring certain of the\n[441.6s] children of Israel and of the king's sin\n[444.8s] and of the\n[446.8s] princes. Go to verse four. Read with me\n[450.1s] and you understand the\n[451.6s] Bible. Children in\n[453.9s] whom was no blemish. But Lord favored\n[458.7s] skillful in all wisdom and turning in\n[463.2s] knowledge, understanding, science and\n[466.6s] such had the ability in them to stand in\n[469.3s] the king's palace and whom they might\n[471.5s] teach the learning and the tongues of\n[473.5s] the childins.\n[475.4s] So from that point we get the\n[477.8s] requirement of\n[480.1s] Nebuchadzza to Ashenaz concerning the\n[483.8s] unex\n[485.1s] whom he was to bring. So the question\n[488.9s] comes what was they to learn in Babylon?\n[492.9s] They were to\n[494.4s] learn the language of the child\n[497.9s] beans because these people already they\n[501.0s] had one understanding of\n[506.3s] wisdom turning in all\n[509.6s] knowledge and understanding\n[512.8s] science and such had the ability in them\n[515.4s] to stand in the king's palace.\n[519.8s] So they had that you read the book who\n[521.8s] was the place a book called place in\n[523.6s] Bible\n[524.7s] education. Do you have it there? I want\n[528.1s] I want a hard copy. I only mark in the\n[531.0s] hard copy. If you go to the book place\n[533.8s] of Bible\n[536.5s] education in education bring me the hard\n[538.9s] copy. I want to read something on that\n[541.6s] written by Edo Trevia Jones. It will\n[544.8s] tell you that these people had the\n[547.0s] understanding from where? Get me the\n[549.8s] book parts and prophets pay 2\n[553.2s] 596. Yeah, that's what I want. Help me\n[555.8s] with\n[558.4s] it. You come and buy this book. He's\n[561.0s] only 600 shillings. I want us to read\n[563.4s] the book place of Bible education. Get\n[565.1s] me the book parts and prophet page\n[567.9s] 596. Education of Daniel. Uhhuh.\n[571.6s] So I want you to read\n[573.8s] this. Go to\n[576.4s] chapter 8 of the place of Bible\n[580.0s] education. Please go with me very fast.\n[583.5s] That chapter 8 it should be page 67 in\n[586.4s] this book 596. You read\n[590.5s] lesson before I read this I want to give\n[593.1s] the Bible principle alone. So these\n[595.4s] people were accounting in everything\n[596.7s] that they required. Okay, let's move to\n[599.4s] chapter 2 of Daniel\n[602.7s] uh chapter one sorry. So after that\n[605.4s] there was a test that this were to pass\n[608.6s] and that test Daniel and the\n[612.7s] fellow said don't give us the food from\n[617.0s] the king's me king's table but give us\n[619.8s] water and you know the things okay so I\n[623.1s] want you to prove this verse\n[626.4s] 12 prove thy servant I beseech thee 10\n[629.2s] days and let them give us pulses to eat\n[632.6s] and water to\n[635.1s] Then let our countenance be looked upon\n[637.4s] before thee, and countenance of the\n[639.7s] children that eat of the portion of the\n[641.4s] king's meat, as thou seeest, deal with\n[644.5s] thy servants. So he consented with them\n[647.1s] in this matter and prove them 10\n[650.6s] days. Verse 15 is very critical. At the\n[654.2s] end and at the end of the 10 days the\n[658.1s] accountants what you can\n[661.2s] look appeared fairer and fatter in flesh\n[665.0s] than all the children which did eat the\n[667.2s] portion of the king's meat. One thus\n[670.7s] took away the portion of their meat and\n[672.3s] the one that they should drink and gave\n[674.0s] them passes.\n[676.4s] As for these four children, God gave\n[679.1s] them one knowledge, two skills in\n[684.1s] learning and wisdom. And Daniel had\n[686.4s] understanding in all vision and dream.\n[689.6s] Verse 18. Now at the end of the days\n[692.8s] that the king had said he should bring\n[695.2s] them in, the princes the unic brought\n[697.5s] them in before Nebuchadnezzar and the\n[699.8s] king communed with them. And among them\n[701.8s] all was found none like Daniel, Naniah,\n[705.0s] Michelle and Nazar. Therefore today\n[706.9s] before the king verse 20 and in all\n[711.4s] matters all matters is it left\n[716.0s] out? Is it left out? Is farming left\n[719.8s] out? What about globe making and dress\n[724.0s] cutting? What about electrical\n[726.4s] engineering call it? What about flying\n[730.0s] aircraft? What is left out in\n[733.1s] all? Y all is like I'm\n[736.4s] reading God has the ability to cleanse\n[738.7s] us from all\n[740.1s] unrighteousness. So it says and in all\n[743.9s] matters of what is called wisdom and\n[747.8s] knowledge and understanding the king\n[750.8s] inquired that the king inquired of them.\n[753.9s] He found them 10 times better than all\n[757.9s] one magicians.\n[761.0s] Two,\n[763.9s] three, everyone. So I'm asking this\n[766.3s] question to you. I'm posing a bit.\n[769.0s] Listen to my\n[770.4s] question. Whom do you think were the\n[773.4s] lecturers in Babylon at this\n[777.6s] time? I'm reversing the my question\n[780.0s] again. Whom do you think were the\n[781.6s] lecturers or the teachers in Babylon at\n[784.6s] this time teaching and lecturing Daniel,\n[787.5s] Azariah and\n[789.3s] Michelle? See the same magicians and\n[792.8s] astronomers. Okay, that is when you go\n[795.8s] to Daniel chapter 2, you get that they\n[798.2s] do not understand why the wisdom of the\n[802.0s] world is foolishness with\n[805.2s] God. God is good.\n[809.1s] Which knowledge do you think you can be\n[811.4s] 10 times wiser than your\n[816.0s] lecturer?\n[818.1s] Yes. Which knowledge do you think you\n[820.6s] can be 10 times wiser than your parents\n[823.1s] who are still in\n[825.7s] Babylon? So where do you think they got\n[828.9s] this knowledge? Where I want to give you\n[832.5s] where they got the knowledge.\n[837.0s] More with me. If you have the book less\n[839.6s] of Bible\n[842.1s] education, I want you listen to what I\n[845.0s] read. Page\n[846.3s] 68. Now blemish and wellpowered. This\n[849.0s] will require that they should be\n[850.4s] physically sound, wellbe and\n[853.4s] symmetrical.\n[855.9s] The world trans wisdom, knowledge and\n[858.0s] science is vers Hebrew is death, murder,\n[861.5s] pogma and are cruc the second is\n[864.3s] extension of the first, the third and of\n[866.4s] the second. So\n[868.8s] listen. Therefore the requirement of\n[871.0s] kingzar in selecting of this youth was\n[873.9s] that they should be physically sound. Is\n[876.3s] that right? symmetrical belt and that\n[880.0s] mentally they should be one skillful in\n[883.3s] deciding what is called valuable\n[885.0s] knowledge. Do you know what's called\n[886.8s] valuable\n[888.3s] knowledge? Do you know what's called\n[890.0s] valuable\n[892.1s] knowledge? Huh? The valuable knowledge\n[895.0s] is this. You have the ability to discern\n[898.7s] when to plant. Is that a knowledge that\n[900.8s] is\n[901.9s] valuable which adds value? Uhhuh.\n[905.5s] skillful ability to acquire such\n[907.0s] knowledge turning in the acquisition of\n[909.0s] knowledge by thinking and\n[911.3s] application. You get this point. You\n[914.0s] know many people go to school they think\n[916.5s] but where to apply is the problem. And I\n[919.8s] ask you\n[921.1s] question where do you apply Pythagoras\n[923.6s] theorem in the real world? Who has been\n[926.0s] told where to apply Pythagoras theorem\n[927.5s] in the real world?\n[931.0s] Yes. Who knows where to apply Pythagoras\n[933.5s] theorem in the real world?\n[939.4s] So this is what these people had the\n[941.1s] ability to discern and acquire that\n[943.0s] knowledge and where to apply it.\n[945.8s] Understanding how to correlate,\n[948.8s] classify, systemize the knowledge which\n[951.4s] they had faculty discern was valuable\n[954.8s] knowledge and which they were cunning in\n[957.5s] gathering. So let me take you where they\n[959.6s] acquired that knowledge. Go to the book\n[961.4s] of 1 Samuel. I'm telling them where they\n[963.6s] acquired the knowledge. as you stand up.\n[965.3s] 1st Samuel\n[967.5s] 19:20. Read with me 1st Samuel\n[975.2s] 19:20. And also 2 Kings 6 1-6. I'm\n[978.3s] reading that. Then we\n[980.0s] just\n[982.3s] finish. Yes. Yeah.\n[987.3s] And Saul sent\n[988.6s] messengers to take\n[992.8s] David. And when they saw the company of\n[995.6s] the prophets\n[999.8s] Uh-huh.\n[1002.7s] Uh-huh. So then we just stop there. So\n[1005.8s] it's this there was the schools of the\n[1008.6s] prophets before these children of Israel\n[1011.4s] were c were taken captive. So this all\n[1015.6s] knowledge that was revealed in the\n[1019.5s] Babylonian as a country by then was\n[1022.7s] acquired in the schools of the prophets.\n[1025.2s] Two, these men were living under the\n[1029.4s] guidance of their\n[1032.9s] parents. Okay? So their parents were\n[1036.8s] building a character within heaven. So\n[1040.1s] there's a part of a parent to play in\n[1042.5s] character building. Read me that PP\n[1046.8s] 596. PP 596. We are I'm done with my\n[1051.1s] answer. PP\n[1052.9s] 596. Just start from paragraph one.\n[1057.8s] Uh-huh. Mhm.\n[1064.4s] Mhm. The great life work of life is\n[1067.1s] character\n[1070.1s] building. In the knowledge of God is the\n[1072.4s] foundation of all true\n[1074.5s] education to impart this\n[1078.1s] knowledge and to know the character in\n[1080.9s] the knowledge with\n[1083.2s] heat. So the object of teachers work is\n[1086.2s] that.\n[1090.5s] Uhhuh.\n[1092.4s] Uhhuh.\n[1094.7s] Yeah.\n[1099.1s] Mhm. Yeah.\n[1105.3s] Yeah.\n[1108.4s] Mhm. Go to go to page\n[1112.8s] 595. Uhhuh. Yes. 59. Let me read. It\n[1117.2s] says\n[1119.1s] uh le in the in the days of 593\n[1121.4s] paragraph 2. In some days there were two\n[1124.0s] schools. One at Rama the home of the\n[1126.6s] prophets another at Jerim where the ark\n[1129.4s] then was others were established in\n[1131.8s] their times. The people of this school\n[1133.8s] sustain themselves by their own labor in\n[1136.2s] tilling the land. So one we need to\n[1138.2s] study what is called ABC education\n[1140.6s] tilling the land or in some mechanical\n[1143.4s] employment. Uhhuh. In Israel it was\n[1147.0s] thought strange or degrading. Indeed, it\n[1150.2s] was regarded as a crime to allow\n[1151.8s] children to grow up in ignorance of\n[1154.1s] useful labor. By the command of God,\n[1156.6s] every child was storm some trade. Uhhuh.\n[1160.0s] Even though he was to be educated for\n[1161.7s] holy office. So the main object of\n[1164.7s] education in Israel was for what?\n[1167.7s] Redemption. And holy office was to\n[1169.8s] preserve for them. But as far as that,\n[1172.0s] they were also to do what is called\n[1174.2s] mechanical work, toiling the land. Last\n[1177.2s] many of the religious teachers supported\n[1178.7s] themselves by manual labor even so late\n[1182.0s] as the time of the apostle Paul and\n[1184.1s] Achil Aquilia no less honored because\n[1187.1s] they earn lively by their trade of dent\n[1189.9s] making. So that is it. Okay. Welcome.\n[1204.9s] The next person who is\n[1207.3s] coming just to\n[1210.2s] be\n[1213.9s] shorting myself in the\n[1219.8s] Are you coming to preach?\n[1223.1s] I want us to be very short because if I\n[1225.7s] want to ask questions and you take 20\n[1228.4s] minutes\n[1230.9s] please. So I will be doing something\n[1233.4s] there.\n[1236.0s] something too many. You just say this,\n[1240.2s] this\n[1242.0s] this maybe tomorrow.\n[1252.3s] Praise God.\n[1254.2s] Uh I'm going to\n[1255.8s] answer I think one question that uh\n[1259.8s] should I be employed by the government\n[1262.8s] if I believe the\n[1265.6s] truth\n[1268.3s] may okay let us go to the book of\n[1271.0s] proverbs chapter 22.\n[1274.0s] The main reason why people are being\n[1275.6s] employed number one people want to live\n[1279.1s] a good life, riches, wealth and hope and\n[1283.4s] honor in the\n[1284.9s] society. 22 of Proverbs read verse 4. It\n[1290.8s] says by\n[1296.4s] and so those three things that that\n[1299.8s] matter so much in the life of any person\n[1302.1s] living they are being got\n[1304.1s] by to the fear of the lord and the fear\n[1308.6s] of the lord is the beginning of\n[1310.8s] knowledge now I want to answer the\n[1314.0s] second one should I train it we talk\n[1318.0s] about we have children where should we\n[1319.9s] take them to learn something like that.\n[1322.2s] Yeah.\n[1324.6s] Yes.\n[1326.4s] Yes. Yeah. That one I'm going to take\n[1328.7s] you to the book of the same same book.\n[1331.1s] Proverbs 22 verse number six. It says\n[1336.0s] train up where you should go.\n[1340.0s] Uhhuh. So train up a child. uh I don't\n[1343.2s] know if this instruction was given to\n[1345.4s] the teachers in the school but I think\n[1347.5s] the same as parents and uh that includes\n[1351.4s] fathers and and mothers you brought a\n[1354.8s] study of\n[1355.9s] um a study of uh about\n[1360.2s] uh Daniel and the the three Hebrew\n[1364.2s] brothers I think I remaining with one\n[1367.1s] minute I I will just give you a book\n[1370.2s] there's a book known has story of Daniel\n[1373.1s] the prophet. There is a a\n[1376.4s] chapter or written a true education and\n[1380.2s] uh I will not read everything. I will\n[1381.9s] explain for you so you go and read uh\n[1385.7s] after the announcement by prophet Isaiah\n[1389.6s] that the Babylonians will be be coming\n[1392.0s] to this city to destroy it and to take\n[1394.8s] some of the vessels of God to their\n[1396.9s] land. Mothers and the parents who were\n[1400.6s] who heard about this started teaching\n[1403.5s] their kids the sin the history of Israel\n[1407.7s] were studied and the story of Nadab and\n[1411.5s] Abihu was told and retold. They were\n[1414.6s] being taught through songs and also they\n[1417.6s] were being also taught about the effect\n[1419.9s] of health uh bad health in the family\n[1423.1s] like the effect of strong dream was\n[1425.4s] impressed upon the mind. the laws of his\n[1428.8s] own being was studied. He knew that\n[1431.4s] excess in eating and drinking will s the\n[1434.3s] mind that the voice of God could not be\n[1437.4s] heard. I'm I'm still looking a text that\n[1441.0s] will tell me that Daniel was was\n[1444.2s] employed in Babylon. I think it was a\n[1447.0s] forced labor. Was there that Daniel was\n[1450.0s] employed and was receiving a certain\n[1452.2s] amount of money every month? I think is\n[1455.0s] there it was employed but receiving\n[1457.7s] amount of money building even houses\n[1460.0s] even ordering some cars from abroad so\n[1463.4s] I'm still looking for that verse if\n[1465.8s] there is then Daniel was employed in\n[1468.7s] Babylon and receiving\n[1471.9s] yes teacher of education\n[1477.4s] come will be all of you cannot answer\n[1481.0s] this questions amen\n[1483.8s] You can only ask another one. I'm going\n[1487.0s] to be very brief. The first verse that\n[1489.3s] was read is John 17:15 that says that\n[1493.7s] keep them from evils of the what? The\n[1496.3s] world is is what it that they in the\n[1499.4s] world but need they need to be kept from\n[1501.1s] the evils of the what? It says\n[1505.1s] out of the world. Out of the\n[1507.0s] world. The first principle to keep\n[1509.9s] somebody out of the evil is to separate\n[1511.8s] him from the the world. Number two,\n[1514.6s] there's a question that has been asked\n[1516.4s] about\n[1517.5s] Daniel commented on it. I want just read\n[1519.8s] a quotation on where Daniel obtained his\n[1521.6s] education. So that when we are talking\n[1523.3s] about number one need to know that those\n[1526.2s] people where they education I'm reading\n[1529.1s] place of the Bible in education page 80\n[1531.5s] paragraph one very fast says that the\n[1533.8s] specification distinctly made in the\n[1536.7s] scriptures so it should be projected\n[1539.3s] place of Bible in education page 80\n[1541.5s] paragraph one very fast it\n[1545.3s] reads\n[1548.1s] Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Mhm.\n[1553.6s] Mhm. Uh-huh.\n[1557.5s] Mhm. It is not small tribute to the\n[1560.4s] educational\n[1562.0s] ideas.\n[1563.6s] Indeed, this view of education as the\n[1566.6s] Bible as shown in the vers of the Bible\n[1569.4s] were for all practical what purposes\n[1572.8s] advance of the educational system. Fine\n[1575.1s] and\n[1576.3s] advance educational system. By the way,\n[1579.7s] what required from those people was\n[1582.6s] advanced education that the one that\n[1584.5s] exists today. Read the next statement.\n[1588.6s] Even the leading college and\n[1590.2s] universities of the United States. So\n[1593.2s] what was even higher than the education\n[1596.8s] that was providing the universities and\n[1598.7s] colleges of United what? States. Yet yet\n[1602.3s] Daniel\n[1606.4s] Daniel successfully were able\n[1608.8s] successfully such to pass such an\n[1611.2s] examination where then they said such\n[1613.9s] education that exceeded even the\n[1615.5s] education that was provided in the\n[1617.6s] university.\n[1619.4s] Uhhuh. But me you the answer to this\n[1622.0s] question the answer to this question is\n[1625.0s] worth having. worth having besides\n[1627.0s] besides we need it just now for all this\n[1630.8s] for last days. Next\n[1632.5s] paragraph where then you see people says\n[1636.0s] that\n[1636.8s] Daniel were taken to what to learn what\n[1640.2s] Babylon get this get this where then\n[1644.1s] Daniel and his three\n[1646.8s] companions the education enabled them\n[1650.6s] successfully to\n[1654.8s] pass them skillful in all wisdom and\n[1658.6s] cunning in knowledge and science.\n[1661.8s] All these things withoutation\n[1665.4s] it can be answered in a school. In the\n[1667.8s] schools of what? So during the times of\n[1670.3s] prophets there was a what? A school.\n[1672.2s] Read the divinely established school.\n[1674.4s] The divinely established school in what?\n[1677.4s] So in Israel there was a school\n[1679.6s] established. Continue reading.\n[1682.6s] There was that that time\n[1685.2s] a school of the what? In Jerusalem. in\n[1693.2s] Jerusalem. So we need to understand that\n[1695.5s] the the likes of Daniel I could have\n[1697.6s] read many things but the lack of Daniel\n[1699.6s] obtained an education in the university\n[1701.5s] on Israel. Okay. Number two. Number two.\n[1705.8s] 1 28 paragraph 2 says that God's purpose\n[1708.8s] in giving the third angel's message.\n[1710.5s] God's purpose in giving the angels\n[1712.7s] message to the world to prepare people\n[1715.4s] to stand true to him during the\n[1717.4s] investigative what? Judgment. This is\n[1719.9s] the purpose for which we establish and\n[1721.8s] maintain our publishing houses. Our\n[1724.4s] what? Our schools, our sanitariums,\n[1727.8s] hygienic restaurants, treatment what?\n[1730.1s] treatment rooms and factories factories.\n[1733.4s] This is our purpose in carrying forward\n[1735.8s] the work in every word every life. Okay.\n[1739.0s] So God's purpose to carry the message is\n[1741.7s] that we have our own what our own\n[1743.5s] school. Hallelujah. The last thing I'm\n[1745.8s] saying is that not all the knowledge\n[1749.5s] that is in the world is unnecessary. Are\n[1752.6s] we together? What Satan is doing is\n[1755.2s] mingling truth and and air. You go to\n[1758.6s] place of Bible education, you realize\n[1760.2s] that even in our schools where we have\n[1762.3s] to maintain this in our schools there\n[1764.4s] are things that we have to teach. One of\n[1766.6s] them language must be taught, geography\n[1769.0s] must be taught, must be\n[1771.7s] taught anatomy and\n[1774.0s] physiology must be music must be done\n[1776.5s] what must be taught. Amen. And therefore\n[1778.6s] when the Lord has brought a knowledge\n[1780.7s] that will help in carrying on the\n[1783.1s] gospel, that knowledge will be accepted\n[1785.8s] by God's people, God's people. So long\n[1787.7s] as that knowledge will\n[1789.9s] not confuse them the mind and lead to\n[1792.9s] what to say. Amen. Others will be\n[1795.4s] handled in the next lesson in Jesus\n[1797.0s] name.\n[1804.5s] You want to answer or you want to ask a\n[1808.1s] question? Question is\n[1814.3s] coming. Yes.\n[1816.8s] this many\n[1818.5s] hands. Put your hands\n[1822.6s] down like you ask the\n[1827.1s] question still being answered.\n[1833.3s] Yes. The context for my question. The\n[1836.7s] context for my question was is it wrong\n[1838.9s] to be to study or to be employed in that\n[1844.1s] institution? Not the not the what being\n[1848.1s] taught is wrong because I think the\n[1851.9s] there should be a simultaneous\n[1853.3s] application whereby parents can teach\n[1856.0s] the way Daniel and the others were\n[1858.1s] taught and then that the knowledge from\n[1861.0s] home will help them to survive in those\n[1864.8s] so my questioning\n[1871.5s] me and I go and work there is it just to\n[1875.1s] go and work\n[1876.9s] or is it wrong\n[1878.7s] just\n[1881.2s] leaving it wrong?\n[1887.0s] So that means those who be answering the\n[1889.7s] questions you don't even note them down\n[1892.2s] you love answering you don't note you\n[1894.9s] don't yes amen so note the questions so\n[1899.9s] that you may not come and don't\n[1904.0s] answer now who want to answer that if\n[1907.6s] you have noted so that you may not come\n[1909.4s] and start out a study till the somebody\n[1912.4s] who ask a question is wondering am I\n[1914.8s] being answered Yes, but at least you\n[1918.3s] have gotten that Daniel did not go to\n[1920.6s] Babylon to study. In fact, Daniel\n[1923.9s] chapter one is written that he had all\n[1926.8s] knowledge and wisdom. By the way, they\n[1928.9s] had everything while with us we are\n[1930.6s] going to school to acquire those\n[1932.0s] knowledge. But they all all knowledge\n[1934.8s] wisdom full of science all things and in\n[1938.4s] fact it is written that the knowledge\n[1941.2s] wanted cannot even be found in\n[1943.5s] University of United States. So that\n[1947.0s] means those people went there when\n[1948.5s] already that prepared. The question was\n[1950.2s] where did they get the education they\n[1952.8s] got it from the what back at their home\n[1956.3s] somebody came here who read that they\n[1958.0s] were taught even health at home. Even\n[1959.7s] their standing with health message in\n[1962.2s] Daniel in Babylon was not an accident.\n[1965.4s] It was not what an is the first\n[1968.2s] principle. Even when you are going to be\n[1969.8s] answered going to work there. Number\n[1972.4s] two, it was also a command of God that\n[1975.9s] let them go to Babylon. Remember God\n[1978.6s] told Jeremiah said that those who will\n[1980.5s] refuse will be killed. But again, our\n[1982.8s] command now is not to go to Babylon. It\n[1984.7s] is to come out of Babylon. Our command\n[1987.5s] is different. Their command was to go\n[1989.1s] bon all of you that y is coming put your\n[1992.5s] y ours is to come out of so we have to\n[1996.7s] look line upon line the other line and\n[1999.0s] this line and connect somebody to come\n[2000.9s] and ask yes yes felix come and then we\n[2005.0s] are you will the rest will answer the\n[2006.9s] next questions is still the same\n[2010.1s] so thank\n[2012.0s] you you take 2 minutes yes\n[2017.1s] go is\n[2018.8s] I want to read one verse. 1 Corinthians\n[2021.1s] 6:17 I think says that\n[2024.9s] 6:17\n[2026.4s] verse from verse 14 very fast\n[2029.4s] the Bible reads the praise of the Lord\n[2033.1s] is it second or 2 Corinthians 6:14\n[2038.0s] the Bible reads\n[2041.3s] be not equally y together with\n[2044.6s] unbelievers both fellowship as\n[2046.9s] righteousness or unrighteousness Yes.\n[2050.9s] What is what communion as light with\n[2053.0s] darkness?\n[2056.0s] So who is unbeliever do not be collect\n[2058.5s] together with unbeliever. Who is\n[2062.6s] unbeliever? Who is unbeliever?\n[2067.1s] So we cannot we cannot be united with\n[2070.2s] someone in business transaction. White\n[2073.1s] says that we cannot even be united in\n[2075.3s] business transaction with those who do\n[2077.8s] not believe\n[2079.1s] what with those who do not believe the\n[2081.6s] the present. So it is\n[2083.7s] wrong. It is wrong to be employed in\n[2087.0s] such a school in in in worldly\n[2089.7s] employment because they are unbelievers.\n[2091.7s] You cannot work among them because you\n[2093.6s] have a precious truth. So I wanted to\n[2096.6s] read read the last quote education page\n[2100.6s] 77.\n[2102.7s] says that where Christ also receive his\n[2106.0s] education so we are not to be employed\n[2108.2s] by\n[2109.2s] worldly as I read that I am quoting\n[2111.9s] great controversy page 491.2 2 says that\n[2116.1s] while men will be absorbed in business\n[2118.7s] pursuit their probation will be what?\n[2121.8s] Closing. Amen. So you cannot be employed\n[2124.7s] in worldly institution if you have these\n[2129.2s] truths. Page\n[2132.8s] 77.1 I think the value of principle. No\n[2137.0s] I want to read the last last statement\n[2139.0s] says that education directly from\n[2141.3s] heaven.\n[2144.4s] Now listen where we need to obtain\n[2146.2s] directly from heaven appointed\n[2151.0s] sources. Gain directly from appointed\n[2153.7s] sources. This education was gained\n[2155.9s] direct directly from heaven appointed\n[2158.2s] sources. From useful work. Number one\n[2161.4s] useful useful work from the study of the\n[2164.4s] scriptures. Study of the B of study of\n[2167.5s] the scriptures of nature. Nature and\n[2169.8s] from the experience of life. The\n[2171.2s] experience of what? Those are the four\n[2173.8s] syllabus. So we are not going to be\n[2176.6s] employed by the word useful work\n[2179.1s] scriptures\n[2181.0s] nature. Amen. I think I'm done.\n[2185.4s] So as\n[2187.0s] uh as comes the simple\n[2191.4s] answer is you can put\n[2193.5s] [Music]\n[2195.4s] here there will be a direct answer to\n[2197.8s] your question.\n[2202.6s] It is very\n[2211.7s] direct. You you have to come forward.\n[2214.5s] Can we allow come forward? Just come\n[2217.4s] forward so that we maybe\n[2222.4s] maybe Yes.\n[2229.9s] Okay, good evening.\n[2233.0s] My question\n[2234.6s] is on it was yesterday that Kosg was\n[2238.4s] teaching about\n[2239.7s] talents and he was saying that if you\n[2243.0s] abandon one bar one talent you be\n[2246.4s] responsible for\n[2247.8s] it isn't it that so I'm\n[2252.7s] asking there is an example you give that\n[2255.8s] if you have a talent of\n[2258.0s] business and the same time you are for\n[2261.1s] farming\n[2262.8s] And business if you can come to the real\n[2266.0s] world business is mostly empowered with\n[2269.2s] worldly\n[2271.1s] things.\n[2273.0s] So if I abandon those business that is\n[2277.6s] associated with worldly things and go\n[2281.4s] to farming which is not which is useful\n[2285.6s] and not worldly. So will life be\n[2289.0s] responsible for that? And the another\n[2291.7s] question is there is this practical\n[2294.5s] institutions\n[2296.0s] that we go and\n[2298.3s] learn something like maybe construction\n[2302.2s] of our own\n[2303.9s] houses. Are they bad? And if they are\n[2308.1s] bad, which way\n[2310.6s] forward? And I think the last question\n[2314.4s] is\n[2317.5s] this or these items we are using here\n[2321.0s] even cooking are made from the worldly\n[2324.2s] instructions and if we shall stop using\n[2326.8s] them and maybe return to the maybe if it\n[2329.8s] is cooking we return to ports. So I hope\n[2334.2s] from tomorrow we will be cooking using\n[2336.4s] pots not free if it is.\n[2345.2s] Thank you. Good\n[2350.0s] evening. We thank God for all these\n[2352.6s] privileges to be together to share these\n[2354.8s] messages and we hope the Lord is leading\n[2357.9s] us. One thing I believe is that the\n[2361.2s] Lord wants us to be balanced in\n[2364.0s] everything and to follow the voice of\n[2366.4s] truth and make decisions. Amen.\n[2369.6s] So I know the questions that the brother\n[2372.2s] ask us the last questions\n[2375.2s] uh let me begin with the other one first\n[2378.6s] though brother Maxwell has promised that\n[2380.3s] he will blow something there which will\n[2382.6s] solve everything uh on the question but\n[2385.7s] let me give my\n[2387.5s] view as a people as we stand\n[2390.7s] today as the teacher for true education\n[2393.4s] has said we have lost our birthight you\n[2397.4s] know we sold it\n[2400.4s] Um those people who followed our\n[2402.7s] pioneers they sold us away. They never\n[2406.0s] maintained our schools. We had Lalinda,\n[2408.3s] we had Madison school, we had Battle\n[2410.5s] Creek Colleges. These places were\n[2412.7s] superior. If you study the history of\n[2416.1s] the great depression, economic\n[2418.6s] depression in\n[2421.2s] 1929, when the secretary of education of\n[2424.9s] the United States of America visited\n[2427.6s] Madison school, he said, \"All American\n[2431.3s] schools should be ordered in this\n[2433.2s] manner.\" They were running in the best\n[2435.9s] way possible that any government school\n[2438.6s] will wish to run. We sold it away. We\n[2441.8s] lost it. What we are doing in this\n[2444.7s] generation is we are crying out for\n[2448.0s] restoration of those places. So this\n[2450.9s] voice that is crying right now is not\n[2453.8s] pointing us at a place where we have but\n[2456.2s] saying we have lost it, we want to\n[2459.1s] regain it. Amen.\n[2461.2s] So by saying those places have a problem\n[2466.1s] is a voice calling that we should go\n[2468.6s] back to something which we must do\n[2471.1s] practically not just by words. So when\n[2475.1s] we said those places are evil let me\n[2477.5s] just put it now in a few words after\n[2479.6s] saying\n[2480.9s] that my brother has already said not\n[2485.6s] everything in the world is negative. The\n[2489.3s] problem is that there is a mingling of\n[2492.3s] error and what and truth. And the Lord\n[2495.2s] wants us to establish places where we\n[2497.3s] can find truth in its purity. That's the\n[2500.4s] thing. And we want to move there slowly.\n[2503.6s] We don't want to speak as though we\n[2505.2s] already have the places. No, we are\n[2507.4s] heading to that direction. And that's\n[2509.5s] our cry as a people. So, brother, we do\n[2512.7s] not have such places. The Lord wants us\n[2514.8s] to establish such a places and we are\n[2517.2s] beginning that work first by accepting\n[2519.6s] that we have missed the point and now we\n[2521.7s] can begin from here going towards that\n[2524.0s] direction and for our children we are\n[2527.5s] making preparations so that they will\n[2529.9s] not be partakers of these places. I'm\n[2532.9s] speaking because my child is not yet of\n[2535.2s] age. For those whose children are of\n[2537.4s] age, they have already made a decision\n[2539.4s] to begin doing it. You get the point. So\n[2542.0s] and as a church we must take up this\n[2543.8s] work and lead it to the father's place.\n[2547.2s] Um one still one example suffer me\n[2551.6s] brother. Uh Hezekiah when he was visited\n[2555.0s] by the ambassadors from Babylon they\n[2558.0s] were Ezekiah was supposed to tell them\n[2560.5s] about the true God right and how he had\n[2563.8s] gotten healed. But instead he showed\n[2567.2s] him all the things that he had. And the\n[2570.0s] Lord said, \"The days are coming when\n[2572.8s] your children, even born of yourself,\n[2574.9s] shall be taken to Babylon. Shall they\n[2576.6s] shall be made unax, and they shall serve\n[2578.8s] the king.\" So Daniel and his friends\n[2581.4s] never served in Babylon because they\n[2584.1s] they loved it. No, it was not that way.\n[2587.8s] God really gave them privileges because\n[2589.8s] they respected God. So that the king of\n[2593.1s] Babylon treated them with favors. But\n[2595.6s] see, they were made unox. Do you know\n[2597.2s] what that means? They were\n[2601.2s] castrated. Think about\n[2604.6s] that. Can anyone go to school to be\n[2607.6s] castrated? No. No. No. No. I really\n[2609.8s] don't think so. They never served out of\n[2613.0s] their own willingness. And if we are\n[2616.2s] going to serve out of our own\n[2618.5s] willingness, you realize that we are\n[2620.7s] selling ourselves. So I will say\n[2623.0s] personally in this\n[2624.6s] regard, I'm sorry. I am just re finding\n[2628.6s] it hard to summarize this thing because\n[2631.0s] I found the question so heavy. Should I\n[2634.0s] end it there or I still say something?\n[2636.6s] Two minutes more just two more minutes.\n[2641.1s] So what I wanted to say is these things\n[2643.8s] that we are using here are not\n[2646.8s] evil. We studied yesterday. We realized\n[2649.6s] that the spirit of invention that gift\n[2652.9s] comes from who? From the Lord. It may be\n[2655.6s] misaligned but can't we if we install\n[2659.1s] this system of education can't we be\n[2662.1s] able also to even invent such things I'm\n[2665.8s] persuaded if the adventist never lost\n[2668.0s] that we will be very far much ahead of\n[2670.8s] the world for sure we will be the ones\n[2673.0s] doing these things and not going there\n[2674.6s] to acquire that knowledge you get the\n[2676.2s] point higher than the highest human\n[2678.4s] thought is God's ideal is\n[2680.6s] God's ideal for his children And that's\n[2685.0s] it. Now the rest of the questions the\n[2687.8s] brother has asked I still have lessons\n[2691.0s] in my class and especially what he said\n[2695.1s] I will capture it because I will be\n[2697.0s] talking about what sections of\n[2699.7s] businesses and what sections of works we\n[2703.2s] can engage. Some of them are secular but\n[2706.3s] acceptable. You get the point and some\n[2708.9s] are Christian in practice. I mean they\n[2710.4s] are gospel like running a publishing\n[2712.2s] place. It makes money yet it is for\n[2714.4s] gospel reasons. But if you are a Mason,\n[2717.7s] it's not heralding the gospel proper but\n[2720.6s] it is innocent. That one is not evil. So\n[2723.3s] I'll talk about those businesses in my\n[2726.0s] series on classes. So let me just end it\n[2728.3s] there. Thank you.\n[2730.5s] Thank you. Thank you brother for you\n[2733.4s] will be answered. Even a education is\n[2735.9s] not ended brother. If you come every day\n[2740.1s] again this one now this is\n[2743.5s] GCDP s your question is direct GCDB is\n[2747.9s] general conference bulletin do you\n[2749.5s] believe the spirit of prophecy\n[2752.7s] yes I believe let's read\n[2768.1s] because\n[2772.2s] a question worth asking. If my money\n[2774.3s] belongs to the world, yes, do I belong\n[2778.6s] to the church? Uhhuh.\n[2780.6s] If my abilities are put to the work of\n[2783.4s] the world as of the world of the church\n[2787.4s] as of the church then the Christian\n[2789.6s] consider I belong to the church myself\n[2793.0s] that our attention the Christian how\n[2795.4s] much it cost\n[2798.2s] me how much\n[2810.8s] And it is a question worth asking. If my\n[2813.4s] money belongs to the world, do I belong\n[2817.1s] to the church? If my talent, my\n[2819.9s] abilities are put into the work of the\n[2821.4s] world as of the world and not the work\n[2823.8s] of the church as of the church. The\n[2826.0s] question is worth considering. Do I\n[2827.8s] belong to the church myself? That turns\n[2830.4s] our attention to the question, how much\n[2832.4s] does it take to compose me? How much is\n[2835.0s] there of a man? Do you have a man here\n[2837.5s] at this faculty yonder is about in\n[2839.7s] another place and the fruit of f of his\n[2841.9s] faculty, the fruit of his abilities, the\n[2844.3s] result of his life and endeavor in yet\n[2846.7s] another place. Could that be the man be\n[2849.9s] here? All of\n[2852.1s] him. No sir. All my faculties, all the\n[2856.8s] fruits of my life must wear. If I myself\n[2860.3s] am to be there. We cannot escape that\n[2864.2s] then do I belong to the church? Do I?\n[2867.0s] That is the question. Does 75,000 uh 7th\n[2871.2s] Adventist belong to the church? 75,000\n[2874.8s] 700 belongs to the church. Do we that is\n[2879.0s] the question to illustrate. So get\n[2882.0s] illustration get illustration. Do all\n[2884.2s] these people who are sitting here belong\n[2885.8s] to this channel? That is the question.\n[2888.2s] So illustration now to illustrate\n[2891.7s] illustrate now listen suppose I have my\n[2893.9s] name on the church book belong to the\n[2896.1s] church I'm a school teacher and I'm\n[2898.8s] spend all my time all my endeavor all my\n[2902.5s] ability all my faculty as a school\n[2905.8s] teacher in the world school teaching and\n[2909.0s] teaching in the world school the world's\n[2911.8s] in the world's way the world's education\n[2914.4s] it is worth asking do I belong to the\n[2916.7s] church am I loving the church and giving\n[2919.5s] myself whatever I may profess my faculty\n[2923.0s] my life what am I in the ability which\n[2925.5s] god has given me I am giving it to the\n[2928.4s] world for the world's work and the\n[2930.6s] world's purpose that is so that I am\n[2933.8s] loving the church and give myself do I\n[2936.6s] belong the church suppose I am a\n[2938.9s] physician and I give my ability my\n[2941.1s] talent my faculties my life and I the\n[2944.6s] world's way of what is called medicine\n[2948.0s] the world's way of treating diseases. I\n[2950.4s] stand as a member of the church as\n[2952.6s] belong to the church. I am to be\n[2954.3s] sanctified and cleansed the washing of\n[2956.0s] water with the word of God and that word\n[2958.4s] of God that is given to the church the\n[2960.6s] divine the true system medical treatment\n[2962.8s] the true philosophy and treatment with\n[2964.7s] regard to health disease right living\n[2967.4s] and all these things. I belong to the\n[2969.6s] church to be sanctified and cleansed the\n[2971.7s] washing of water by that word. Instead\n[2974.5s] of doing what that word gives to me to\n[2978.0s] which I am committed as belonging to the\n[2980.0s] church, I take that world gives and\n[2983.1s] devote to the world. What which I get\n[2985.5s] from the world and I belong to the\n[2987.2s] church. Do I? I belong to the church for\n[2990.3s] the purpose of being sanctified.\n[2993.5s] Is that making us not to get this?\n[2998.2s] Okay. I belong to the church for the\n[3000.9s] purpose of being sanctified and cleansed\n[3003.0s] with the washing of water by the word of\n[3005.5s] God to the church. There is in that word\n[3009.0s] and that word itself is a system of\n[3012.8s] education. That is the true and the only\n[3015.8s] true education. I say I belong to the\n[3019.0s] church but I'm satisfied with the\n[3020.7s] world's education with the world's\n[3022.3s] system of education with the world's\n[3024.0s] philosophy of education and I devote my\n[3026.1s] life to that I want to know do I really\n[3029.0s] belong to the church it is precisely I\n[3031.9s] think these\n[3033.8s] things would not get\n[3037.4s] this cuz they are not\n[3040.8s] consequence like that no no now repeat\n[3044.1s] this one there's in that one and Yeah,\n[3047.0s] there is that word and that word itself\n[3049.4s] is a system of education. That is the\n[3052.2s] true that is the only true education. I\n[3054.6s] say I belong to the church but I'm\n[3056.7s] satisfied with the world's education,\n[3058.4s] the world's system education, the\n[3060.0s] world's philosophy education. I devote\n[3062.1s] my life to that. I want to know do I\n[3064.9s] really belong to the church? It is\n[3066.8s] precisely so also as to medical or any\n[3070.7s] other profession. So all processions you\n[3073.2s] can have you take somebody also to get\n[3077.2s] saying taking six days in the pagan\n[3080.1s] institution and one day then you only\n[3081.9s] have a day somebody to get that I still\n[3083.5s] continue and I am a man of other affairs\n[3086.3s] in the world whether it be business or\n[3088.8s] farming or carpenter work I mean the\n[3091.6s] every commercial business world I stand\n[3094.7s] as belong to the church and the efforts\n[3096.6s] which I put forth of thought or endeavor\n[3099.2s] the blessings of God upon it all\n[3101.2s] increase comes. I put it in the worldly\n[3103.6s] bank. I'm not a speculator. I belong to\n[3106.6s] the church. But here is the means God\n[3109.5s] has given to me as a member of the\n[3111.0s] church and I put it into the worldly\n[3113.0s] bank. I loan it to the worldly men to be\n[3115.8s] used in worldly business instead of in\n[3118.3s] the work of the church to which I\n[3119.9s] belong. Then it is fair question for me\n[3122.2s] to ask do I belong to the church? This\n[3125.3s] reference to illustrate. And now there's\n[3128.4s] not one here of these delegates.\n[3130.9s] delegates. You are in the delegates\n[3132.3s] India.\n[3133.9s] The delegates in the land are enough to\n[3136.4s] illustrate. And now there's not one here\n[3139.0s] of these delegates who cannot look all\n[3142.4s] over this land and see thousands upon\n[3144.5s] thousands 7th Adventist who stand in a\n[3146.7s] position as belonging to the church.\n[3149.3s] Which leaves a wide open question for\n[3151.4s] you and to ask. Do I belong to the\n[3153.7s] church? And everyone here knows that if\n[3156.7s] all seven of the adventists in the\n[3157.9s] United State from this day and forward\n[3160.3s] who really belong to the church, you\n[3162.7s] yourself will confess that there is no\n[3164.8s] question at all but that this message\n[3167.4s] could be given to the world in this\n[3170.0s] generation. You can only why this\n[3172.6s] message cannot go\n[3175.6s] now to the church but we are in\n[3178.3s] church. a world person in where the\n[3181.1s] church but not a member and a you can\n[3184.5s] all say amen to\n[3186.2s] that. You know that that is so then you\n[3189.1s] see you going to say amen but you know\n[3192.4s] it is so and then you see brethren the\n[3196.6s] problem is not difficult. The problem is\n[3198.9s] not difficult. It is just this question\n[3200.7s] to be decided. It is not difficult. This\n[3204.1s] issue of education is not what it is\n[3207.6s] just this question to be what decided by\n[3210.4s] it is just to be discussed by each one\n[3213.0s] or himself. The youth must decide for\n[3215.8s] himself.\n[3217.3s] Do I belong to the church? You are going\n[3219.0s] to come out of this meeting. You can\n[3221.0s] work in the world. But again, do you and\n[3223.7s] Christ is coming to take the church.\n[3226.4s] Christ is coming to take a church.\n[3231.7s] Do I belong to the church?\n[3234.6s] Where\n[3235.7s] next? Oh now shall I not shall not I\n[3240.5s] find myself my faculties or my means\n[3243.3s] wrapped up in the work of the world used\n[3245.4s] in behalf of the world or engage the\n[3247.3s] world's work shall not I will not you\n[3251.1s] wall it away from there and put the\n[3253.9s] church's work in the course of the\n[3255.9s] church in the earth to which I belong\n[3258.8s] let that be done and you know that\n[3261.0s] spiritually it will shake this worlds\n[3263.3s] out of its place think of it if only\n[3265.9s] seventh advent in the United States\n[3267.9s] would really consider this allow the\n[3270.0s] church give themselves with their\n[3271.8s] children give their themselves with\n[3274.7s] their children do you know why our\n[3276.6s] schools are failing when they\n[3280.5s] began education where is the money of\n[3282.8s] the advent going the world even these\n[3285.5s] schools who who building who are in the\n[3287.8s] who are board members\n[3290.5s] who are the teachers there are they\n[3292.3s] members of this\n[3293.5s] church those who are teaching in the\n[3295.5s] worldly schools Do we have members in\n[3297.0s] our church here and in our school? What\n[3300.3s] if these talents were used in the\n[3302.8s] church? What if all these talents all\n[3305.7s] were used in the church now and it says\n[3309.2s] yes\n[3310.8s] let that be done and you know that\n[3313.0s] spiritually it will shake this world out\n[3314.6s] of its place. Think of it. If all seven\n[3317.8s] adventists in United States really\n[3319.8s] consider this, love the church, give\n[3322.2s] themselves with their children for the\n[3324.6s] church and to the church, how would our\n[3326.9s] schools work stand? Imagine if all of\n[3339.6s] us it will be stand where it ought and\n[3342.9s] such consecration as that will bring\n[3344.9s] such power from heaven that the teaching\n[3347.0s] will be saved will be easy. The lack of\n[3350.1s] teachers will not be such as it is now.\n[3352.6s] So now we don't even have teachers. We\n[3354.6s] even collect things that should not be\n[3357.9s] collected.\n[3363.0s] Hallelujah. You\n[3366.6s] collect those who have talent in the\n[3373.6s] world.\n[3378.8s] Hallelujah. They know how to teach best.\n[3381.7s] You would have not lacked teachers. The\n[3383.4s] Latin teachers will not be such a\n[3385.0s] hindist. No. And so with all the rest,\n[3388.6s] if all seven day Adventist in the land\n[3391.1s] will turn their families and Christian\n[3393.1s] education and all our families, if we\n[3395.7s] can turn our families to Christian\n[3397.4s] education and the education that becomes\n[3399.7s] the church and education that becomes\n[3401.5s] the church and the world is calling for\n[3403.3s] the church to give. The world is calling\n[3405.5s] the church to give that education. And\n[3407.5s] because he has just said in 1929\n[3409.9s] somebody went where to to the medicine\n[3414.4s] and said this is the what\n[3417.2s] see and now shall I not find myself and\n[3420.1s] my faculties or my mean grabs in the\n[3422.2s] work of the world use the world or\n[3424.3s] engage in the work world's work shall I\n[3426.2s] not shall not I will not you w away from\n[3429.9s] there and put the child's work elites\n[3432.6s] cause of the charge in the earth to\n[3434.8s] which I belong.\n[3441.4s] Somebody's joking here. He's not with\n[3444.0s] us. Yes. Be with us. Please be in\n[3447.4s] church. Be church. Amen. And so with all\n[3451.0s] the rest, if all the seven in the land\n[3453.4s] will turn their families under Christian\n[3455.0s] education, education that that becomes\n[3457.5s] the church and that the world is calling\n[3459.8s] for the church to give and for the want\n[3462.2s] of which and because of the lack of\n[3464.5s] which the world itself is saying that\n[3467.1s] the church in education is a distinctly\n[3469.3s] diminishing quantity.\n[3471.4s] If this were done, the world would\n[3473.6s] easily be rich in this generation. So\n[3476.1s] how can the world be rich in this\n[3477.6s] generation? only through what?\n[3480.7s] There's no way we can reach them. Not\n[3482.4s] through\n[3484.3s] crusades. Okay. If we do crusades and we\n[3487.2s] don't have the true education, we rather\n[3488.8s] stop preaching cuz we are forming\n[3491.4s] churches that are going to be Babylon\n[3493.0s] again. What has made the general content\n[3495.7s] to be Babylon is because of the\n[3497.1s] education of the world. Amen.\n[3501.8s] It is time that there should be one\n[3503.5s] church in the world that will rise and\n[3505.5s] be not a mission quoted in education but\n[3507.9s] be the whole thing in education. If the\n[3510.2s] seventh day Adventist will really give\n[3511.8s] themselves the church loving it giving\n[3514.2s] themsel for it with all their talents\n[3516.4s] all their means all their powers then\n[3518.6s] the whole problem will be solved. So why\n[3520.8s] do we have a problem?\n[3523.0s] There are people inside this movement\n[3524.6s] but they have refused to be the church\n[3526.2s] members\n[3528.2s] and that is why we have a problem will\n[3531.6s] come again. People want to be united. We\n[3535.0s] talk we talk of unity and by the way\n[3538.2s] that book says that in 1860s the church\n[3541.8s] was busy talking of unity and\n[3543.4s] organization while their children were\n[3545.0s] going to the what? World education. That\n[3547.8s] was the\n[3549.3s] problem including the daughter of the\n[3551.7s] prophet when when he died the children\n[3555.6s] of public school came and uh sland says\n[3558.6s] that was the problem. They were busy\n[3560.0s] talking of church organization unity we\n[3562.6s] need to come together unity. What are we\n[3565.0s] talking about\n[3566.0s] now? See unity and organization but they\n[3569.8s] are saying true education was to bring\n[3572.0s] what?\n[3574.3s] Unity. Unity.\n[3576.8s] So it is the same. This is the problem\n[3578.6s] we have. Some people in here but they're\n[3581.2s] not church\n[3583.6s] members. They not church members. That\n[3586.9s] is the only problem. It is the problem\n[3589.0s] is not\n[3593.9s] management. People are not church\n[3595.7s] members.\n[3607.8s] says if the seventh adventist will\n[3610.0s] really give themselves to the church\n[3611.8s] loving it, giving themselves for it with\n[3614.1s] all their talents, all their means, all\n[3616.0s] their powers, then the whole problem\n[3617.8s] will be solved. The world facilities are\n[3620.2s] abandoned. In brother Daniel's discourse\n[3623.0s] last night that was presented to us all,\n[3626.2s] brother Conrad today showed how the\n[3628.4s] fields are open and all ready and the\n[3630.9s] harvest. The prophecies a convention\n[3633.5s] like we are. Uh-huh. The prophecies so\n[3636.4s] abundant show that abundant by the way\n[3639.0s] the prophecies we have been learning\n[3641.4s] here talking of\n[3645.6s] what see\n[3648.0s] schools I will show you the commandments\n[3650.5s] in schools now they look the so\n[3654.1s] prophecies are\n[3655.5s] what so abundant showing that now\n[3658.2s] there's time that have been\n[3660.1s] presented let these people present\n[3662.2s] ourselves to Christ today loving the\n[3664.4s] church, being the church, giving\n[3666.2s] ourselves for it, giving ourselves for\n[3668.1s] the church. This people I say present\n[3671.3s] ourselves to Christ as his church. to\n[3673.5s] love that church, to give ourel for it\n[3676.0s] and to give ourel to it with all\n[3686.2s] our you are not even reading these\n[3688.5s] things with all efforts all the effort\n[3692.8s] of whatsoever kind Uh-huh it will be as\n[3697.3s] sweet was before this will be a holy\n[3699.7s] church. So what will make a holy church?\n[3702.9s] When we give ourselves for the church to\n[3704.8s] the church and in the church and for the\n[3708.2s] church and to the church this will be\n[3710.1s] only not having a wrinkle or any such\n[3714.5s] thing the church the pill and the ground\n[3716.5s] of I will study student who always teach\n[3718.6s] what the church is do you tell them\n[3720.2s] about this\n[3722.8s] education church without a wrinkle\n[3726.1s] see amenal\n[3729.4s] amen is this church having a wrinkle and\n[3731.7s] spot\n[3732.6s] serious\n[3735.0s] the church is the pill on the ground and\n[3737.9s] that was what in 2021 we were in this\n[3740.9s] hall and that is where organization\n[3744.8s] started was I want my church back oh and\n[3748.6s] this was the this was this was 1 Timothy\n[3751.0s] 3:14 and 15 it was look at that church\n[3754.6s] is the church is the mill and the ground\n[3756.7s] the support that the stay of the truth\n[3759.1s] in the world the only means by this\n[3761.1s] world can ever obtain truth is by the\n[3763.0s] church. By the church. It may be that\n[3764.7s] the church like the church of Israel and\n[3767.1s] Judah will not of itself voluntarily\n[3769.4s] spread that truth abroad to the world.\n[3771.4s] The people may like Israel and Judah\n[3773.8s] shut themselves within themselves. Shut\n[3775.6s] themselves within themselves and turn\n[3777.5s] the truth of God away, put other things\n[3779.9s] in its place, shut themselves away from\n[3782.1s] the world and thus fail to give it to\n[3784.0s] the world. But if that must be so, then\n[3787.5s] that church will be scattered. So this\n[3789.4s] church is going to be scattered again as\n[3792.2s] was Israel as was Judah amongst the\n[3794.6s] nation of heathen and they in oppression\n[3797.2s] and in bondage. So that is how Adventist\n[3800.2s] found themselves in\n[3811.6s] 201 will find the truth through the\n[3814.4s] church. So whichever way it may be the\n[3817.9s] only way that the nation can get the\n[3819.4s] truth is from the church. So imagine see\n[3821.9s] we took our children and they were\n[3823.4s] scattered in the bondage but still truth\n[3826.0s] came even in those universities did they\n[3828.7s] get those\n[3830.6s] truths people got it in other way if you\n[3833.8s] joke and you think you escaping\n[3844.4s] Please.\n[3855.6s] Amen. Why don't you say amen? Amen.\n[3859.4s] The only way that God's truth can preach\n[3861.3s] the nation is through the church.\n[3863.7s] Church. Therefore, This is how it is\n[3865.8s] that the church of Christ who is the\n[3868.1s] body of the c of Christ is the bail and\n[3871.0s] the ground the support and the stay of\n[3873.5s] the truth in the world. It is that which\n[3875.7s] keeps alive the truth in the earth. Yes.\n[3877.8s] How then how then can the world obtain\n[3879.8s] the truth from me from me as of the\n[3881.8s] church of the church when all my effort\n[3885.2s] listed this question this question\n[3888.2s] sister is going but he will come back\n[3890.2s] and check it. Amen. Yes. This is\n[3893.0s] important question.\n[3895.0s] Yes. Read it together. How then can the\n[3897.9s] world obtain the truth from me as of the\n[3900.3s] church? The church. When all my efforts,\n[3902.2s] all your efforts are enlisted. Are what?\n[3905.1s] Enlisted. Uhhuh. And spend the world's\n[3907.0s] occupation. My brother, are you seeing\n[3909.6s] this? How then can the world bring good\n[3911.8s] from you when 6 days you are employed in\n[3914.2s] Lala community as of the church? As of\n[3916.8s] the church. Then all my efforts, all\n[3918.9s] your efforts are enlisted. What?\n[3921.6s] Enlisted. Uh-huh. and spent in the\n[3923.8s] world's occupation and in the world's\n[3926.3s] philosophy of occupation. Can that be\n[3928.8s] done? Can that be done? No. Sir, the\n[3932.2s] world cannot see the church in me. The\n[3934.8s] world will not see the church in church\n[3937.5s] in that condition of things. In order\n[3940.0s] for the truth to reach the world by me,\n[3942.4s] who am of the church, it is essential\n[3944.6s] that I shall do the work as the work of\n[3946.8s] the church. Do huh the work as of the\n[3950.2s] church. talking so that we may not\n[3956.9s] get in order for the in order for the\n[3960.2s] worldh in order for the truth to reach\n[3962.4s] the world by me by me who am of the\n[3965.5s] church who am of the church it is\n[3966.9s] essential that I shall do the work as\n[3969.5s] the work of the church the work as the\n[3971.6s] work of the church if I am a farmer if\n[3974.2s] and I\n[3975.7s] think even in farming you will be\n[3982.1s] Amen. If I am a\n[3986.4s] farmer of the church. Hallelujah.\n[3990.2s] Amen. Farmer.\n[4002.8s] Amen.\n[4005.9s] Farm pumpkin.\n[4014.6s] And then you saying you are of the\n[4019.9s] church beans. This is the whole of my\n[4023.5s] beams now.\n[4036.6s] If I'm a teacher, if I'm a what? A\n[4038.9s] teacher. If I'm a teacher, I am a\n[4041.0s] teachers of the church. I'm a teacher of\n[4042.7s] the church. A representative of the\n[4044.3s] church. A representative of the church.\n[4046.2s] I do my work as the work of the church.\n[4048.5s] I do my work as the work of the church.\n[4050.6s] Therefore, therefore this calls that\n[4052.7s] every one of us who profess to belong to\n[4054.8s] the church shall so really belong to the\n[4057.2s] church that everything in our lives\n[4059.4s] everything in our lives in our actions\n[4061.4s] in our actions everything that comes in\n[4063.4s] the course of our lives shall be\n[4065.1s] distinctly of the church was that how\n[4067.0s] pioneers\n[4068.3s] were pioneers\n[4074.9s] among working in the world he was a\n[4077.3s] lecturer and also a pioneer\n[4093.0s] Okay.\n[4098.6s] It reads, \"Huh, therefore, therefore,\n[4101.2s] this cause that everyone of us who\n[4102.6s] profess to belong to the church shall so\n[4104.8s] really belong to the church that\n[4106.2s] everything in our lives in our actions,\n[4109.5s] everything that comes in the course of\n[4110.8s] our lives shall be distinctly of the\n[4113.0s] church shall relate to the church and we\n[4115.5s] will hold it up the glory of God as of\n[4118.2s] the church.\"\n[4119.4s] this the last one. Then then that church\n[4123.4s] will be so filled with the truth and\n[4125.5s] will be so sanctified by the truth with\n[4127.8s] which she is filled that the glory of\n[4129.8s] God which is in that truth will shine\n[4132.0s] forth. The world will see her that\n[4134.2s] glorious church which will be discussed\n[4137.0s] everywhere by the world. That church\n[4139.2s] that everything is for the church. You\n[4141.2s] teach us the church. The glory of the\n[4143.8s] Lord shall be seen upon thee. The word\n[4146.6s] will be fulfilled that she shall rise\n[4149.3s] and shine for our light is come and the\n[4152.1s] glory of the\n[4154.8s] Lord and the Lord is risen upon her. You\n[4157.9s] know that is so now all these only to\n[4161.7s] have said in other words that in the\n[4164.5s] days of the voice of the seventh angel\n[4166.8s] when he shall begin to sound the mystery\n[4169.2s] of God shall begin to sound. The mist of\n[4171.2s] God shall be fulfilled as he and declare\n[4173.8s] to his son the prophets. That mystery of\n[4176.3s] God finished is the gospel preached to\n[4178.6s] all the world that the end may come.\n[4180.8s] That ministry of God is finished in the\n[4182.9s] world is the work of God finished in\n[4185.8s] preaching the gospel to the nation. And\n[4187.5s] it is more than that. Along with that,\n[4189.8s] the mystery of God is God manifest in\n[4191.8s] the flesh. The finished mystery of God\n[4193.7s] is the\n[4195.3s] completion the perfection of the\n[4197.9s] manifestation of God in the flesh in the\n[4200.1s] believers in Jesus who belong to the\n[4202.1s] church. Thus there are two place\n[4204.7s] occupied in the finishing of the mystery\n[4206.2s] of God. One place in the world itself to\n[4208.9s] which the gospel is to be preached, the\n[4210.8s] other place in the lives of the\n[4212.0s] believers of the truth. We might preach\n[4214.0s] and proclaim in words to the ends of the\n[4216.6s] earth to every soul on earth in our\n[4219.8s] generation. So that phase of the work\n[4221.8s] will be completed will be finished. Yet\n[4224.9s] if the manif manifestation of God in the\n[4227.1s] lives of those who preach that is not\n[4229.1s] completed also we could be that thing\n[4231.6s] 10,000 years and the end will never\n[4234.3s] come. It is not\n[4238.5s] simply yet if the manifestation of God\n[4241.8s] in the lives of those who preach that is\n[4244.3s] not completed also we could preach that\n[4247.0s] thing 10,000 years and the end will\n[4250.6s] never come. is not simply that the\n[4253.2s] gospel shall be preached to all the\n[4254.6s] world and fill all the world but it is\n[4257.8s] that when it is done there shall be a\n[4260.2s] people ready to meet at the hand without\n[4263.0s] the finishing of the manifestation of\n[4264.7s] God in the flesh of each believer there\n[4267.0s] can be no finishing of the mystery of\n[4268.8s] God that mystery finished God manifest\n[4272.5s] the flesh mark it means that only God is\n[4276.4s] to be seen in every act of life or\n[4278.7s] believer so that in his life God is\n[4281.6s] manifest only that is the finish of the\n[4283.7s] mystery of God in the way that it counts\n[4286.2s] and you know that if that way were open\n[4290.1s] and God would take position and fill the\n[4292.1s] lives of the 25,000 professed believers\n[4294.9s] today it would be the easiest thing in\n[4297.2s] the world to reach all the nation so\n[4299.7s] that\n[4301.1s] end you know the mystery of God is\n[4303.4s] Christ in you the hope of glory then the\n[4306.4s] finished mystery of God is the finishing\n[4308.4s] of the growth the manifestation of\n[4310.0s] Christ the believer So that we shall\n[4312.0s] stand in this world in the image of\n[4314.0s] Jesus Christ reflecting only him. That\n[4316.6s] when the\n[4320.4s] believers when the believers shall be\n[4322.4s] seen only Christ will be seen.\n[4325.0s] Everything that is said, everything that\n[4326.9s] is done, every tone of voice, all that\n[4329.7s] we are will only of Christ only. That is\n[4333.1s] the finish of the mystery of God in\n[4334.7s] truth in the way that it counts. And\n[4337.2s] that is what has to come before the end\n[4339.6s] can come. That is a child that presents\n[4342.6s] to himself. Hallelujah. Are we far away\n[4347.4s] from are we do you think we are going to\n[4351.4s] make but we are we thank God we are in\n[4354.1s] the line. We are going what is it?\n[4362.9s] What is it?\n[4369.5s] Christian studies in Christian education\n[4371.8s] by EA Southerntherland.\n[4377.1s] [Music]\n[4387.8s] We can decide to be\n[4389.7s] employed. It is our choice. The youth\n[4392.3s] must decide for himself. But again, uh\n[4395.5s] you have seen in your own word. By the\n[4398.6s] end of the call here, we are going to\n[4400.2s] make a call for those who want to be\n[4401.7s] church members. By the way, Vuko, do you\n[4404.9s] think we are going to make it? This is\n[4407.7s] the\n[4408.8s] problem. It is it is the biggest\n[4411.5s] problem. So these talents which are\n[4413.8s] being taught if they're not going to be\n[4415.1s] of\n[4416.4s] church they\n[4430.7s] nothing have influence now read this\n[4433.8s] loudly\n[4436.2s] what's used is the preaching of the\n[4437.5s] gospel today while six days out of seven\n[4440.8s] paganis to get the intellect. What use\n[4444.7s] is the preaching of the gospel on one\n[4448.2s] week? One one day of the week while six\n[4451.7s] days out of the seven paganism guys the\n[4454.4s] intellect. That is\n[4458.4s] why the\n[4460.4s] school calls that those who are in the\n[4462.6s] pagan system of education if they\n[4465.0s] worship it is form of what? Godliness.\n[4468.3s] I hope you used to do it best in West of\n[4471.8s] God. That is why many people have gotten\n[4473.8s] lost today. They were so powerful in\n[4478.0s] church. Unless God help us. By the way,\n[4480.8s] without the help of God, nobody can be\n[4483.9s] found. But God is trying so much.\n[4490.2s] Now\n[4495.1s] every preaching of the gospel in one day\n[4498.0s] of the week. One day of the week Sabbath\n[4500.2s] while six days out of the seven paganism\n[4502.4s] guys the intellect. Why dreaming of\n[4504.9s] heaven or spend Why is it doing what?\n[4507.9s] Dreaming of heaven or spend money to\n[4511.1s] procelite. Money to pro money to proite\n[4513.8s] means money to do what? To preach.\n[4526.8s] So question why of what uses the\n[4529.2s] preaching of the gospel on one day of\n[4530.8s] the week while six days out of seven\n[4533.0s] paganism guys the intellect why is she\n[4535.4s] dreaming of heaven or spend money to\n[4537.8s] proite while pagan education leads your\n[4540.3s] own children by the hand okay even your\n[4543.1s] children again\n[4546.4s] weaves about their find a network of\n[4548.4s] theories which blind their eyes to\n[4550.2s] spiritual\n[4551.7s] truths or students wake up to study how\n[4556.0s] many dogs how many teeth does a dog\n[4560.9s] have many dogs evolution\n[4565.8s] there's wait in the word of the pres\n[4568.3s] president ha of Chicago university say\n[4571.4s] it is difficult to prophesy what the\n[4573.4s] result of our present method education\n[4575.4s] the youth will be in 50 Yes, we are\n[4578.4s] training the mind in our public school.\n[4580.8s] But the moral side of the child's nature\n[4583.0s] is almost entirely neglected.\n[4586.5s] The Roman Catholic cons insist on\n[4589.4s] remedying the this manifest evil. But\n[4592.9s] our Protestant churches seems to ignore\n[4595.4s] it completely. They expect the Sunday\n[4598.4s] school to make good oral public school\n[4601.9s] live and die. And the consequence is\n[4604.4s] that we will look at danger as real as\n[4608.0s] us as any we had to face. Imagine that\n[4611.9s] is what parents are doing to us.\n[4621.8s] You need to\n[4628.3s] teach why you in discipline is this one\n[4631.6s] of use and then you school\n[4638.2s] teachers next time on I think if a\n[4641.4s] parent has refused getting this there's\n[4643.9s] no need of bringing those children to\n[4645.9s] come and destroy people's children who\n[4647.6s] are\n[4648.3s] struggling.\n[4650.3s] Hallelujah. Times when may God help us.\n[4653.7s] I don't want to talk much these things.\n[4655.3s] I I don't want to rob them their power\n[4657.4s] in Jesus name. Amen.\n[4668.5s] We s over these\n[4670.3s] things. Do you know one of the signs of\n[4672.6s] the last days when Christ was about to\n[4674.2s] go to heaven, he used to tell his\n[4675.7s] disciples that I will be arrested,\n[4679.2s] persecuted and on the third day and they\n[4681.7s] were sad and after the sec few hours\n[4685.4s] they were fighting for who is greatest.\n[4688.3s] So one of\n[4689.3s] the says that one of the we need to\n[4692.5s] study closely the life of Jesus\n[4694.2s] especially in the\n[4696.4s] last week is final scene final scene is\n[4700.5s] that the things will be taught to the\n[4702.0s] people of\n[4706.0s] God and then after 3\n[4710.3s] days and then next\n[4715.2s] time and then the following that Sign of\n[4718.2s] the last\n[4719.1s] days something for few minutes I\n[4723.7s] know please God has given this ministry\n[4727.0s] powerful message and those who would\n[4730.2s] want to go to heaven will have to\n[4731.8s] separate let me tell you the pioneers\n[4735.3s] did a great work some were teachers some\n[4737.9s] were medical missionaries they ate and\n[4740.1s] they were working all their money that\n[4741.8s] the money they were getting was for the\n[4743.1s] work of God and their families did not\n[4745.3s] sleep hungry today we don't believe in\n[4747.2s] that in churches some like in Nairobi\n[4750.7s] and other places is they taught that oh\n[4753.0s] Daniel the same word of Daniel it is\n[4754.8s] being used by the GC\n[4759.4s] the pray for us there's a announcement\n[4763.7s] in our people want to be taken managers\n[4767.2s] so\n[4769.8s] manag don't dream of\n[4772.6s] heaven that is those are not my words so\n[4776.2s] sum Amen.\n[4802.0s] Even if all even if we are going to get\n[4804.5s] lost but the name of God is glorified.\n[4807.2s] Amen. That is\n[4810.2s] called he tells he was praying when we\n[4812.8s] were starting young evangelist. You\n[4814.5s] remember that old one who came said even\n[4817.2s] if I get lost let the name of God be\n[4819.8s] what? glorified that grace of God was\n[4823.3s] sufficient to me and I rejected.\n[4834.4s] So, Amen.\n[4845.9s] Don't dream of\n[4853.1s] heaven. I wish no heaven in Jesus name.\n[4858.0s] Other questions tomorrow in Jesus name\n[4861.4s] or any time the committee will decide to\n[4863.5s] put questions and answer. Was the\n[4865.4s] question good? Is there somebody who has\n[4868.3s] made a\n[4870.1s] step? May God help us in\n[4873.2s] Jesus. Who from those questions? Who has\n[4877.0s] a special prayer for God's grace? Who\n[4880.1s] has got you have realized you are not a\n[4882.5s] church\n[4884.4s] member and you want God to help you to\n[4887.0s] be a church member, come forward. This\n[4890.6s] is you know you are those are calls that\n[4893.2s] people can\n[4895.4s] come come\n[4898.7s] for\n[4900.4s] marvelous mar 109 as people stand\n[4905.7s] up\n[4908.5s] 109 109\n[4910.7s] here schools have greatest influence"

why most of the time we give Mission reports to remind us of the today I want to give a very large report since the ministry of evangelist was Oran begin first we have the Advent movement Advent movement that were preaching that Christ was to come in 22nd October 1844 they were preaching that the sanctuary was to be cleansed by the end of3 days sadly enough they never understood that there was also sanctuary in heaven the Advent movement you know was disappointed in the year 1844 but there was a group that remained to study the scriptures a group led by you know that was given a vision that Christ was to go to the most holy place and they went back and stud the sanctuary basing the illustration from the book of HEBs and from that God gave them Revelations and visions and the Sabbath message came to them in 1847 after which they went on with studying the scriptures they began to preach having publishing houses remember we were told that James White began the publishing house was given name sth Day Adventist 18637 Adventist organized into a general conference 1872 18 from 1872 ADV James declare fundamental principles and that the sth Adventist believed on one true God and his son Jesus Christ and the spirit of God the power of God that is why to can have of one true God 1872 1874 another fundamental principle is written 189 another fundamental principle is written allow me just take you briefly on this history as the time was going on things were changing AB you know 1956 there was a question by evangelicals asking if Adventist are remember the first to be discussed the of trity by some people known [Music] as you realize that the sth Adventist began to deny some points of their fath that made them a distinct people realize that the sctu message was denied wison General Conference president by then announced publicly before the sth day Adventist because they are now adopted the Trinity that belong to Catholics there was another another Universal and truly Catholic church called [Music] the will tell the booked messages B4 204 religion was changed but according to the principles of God's government in the book upward Luke 131 we are told that God will always generation to car with the work if the first generation CH proved unfaithful to God now that there group of people that were to study the Bible in the S ADV to give them light to be able to go back to the true principles of and by this allow me tell you that God has been leading a group of people and a brief history just on how evangelist was organized I know there are very many groups that are taking the message but allow me give you the history of people with church members who are sitting here today so that we might know how the Lord has led us in the past now there was a school opened by the general conference confence somewhere in the school was called in it short form in this school people stud the Bible and God gave them light and by this movement of young evangelist was organized in the year 2018 I'll try to be brief because of time so in 2018 the Evangelist Ministry was organized but you see the Church of God had been there before I I I had told you that it began from the Advent movement in 184 it began from 1844 down down the lineing that principle that I that God will choose another generation so the chist in 201 was organized and they began preaching the thirs message within the general conference churches in November 2018 Ministry was expelled from the general conference you can remember most of them were coming from conference so they were expelled from the conference some of them were just chased literally from churches they were expelled and they could not preach in those churches they came to and there was a church that welcome them and that

changing\n[436.6s] AB you know\n[443.1s] 1956 there was a question by\n[445.3s] evangelicals asking if Adventist are\n[453.6s] remember the first to be discussed the\n[455.5s] of\n[461.4s] trity by

God will always\n[557.8s] generation to car with the\n[563.6s] work if the first generation\n[567.0s] CH proved unfaithful to God\n[574.8s] now that there group of people that were\n[578.5s] to study the Bible in the S\n[584.6s] ADV to give them\n[588.4s] light to be able to go back to the true\n[591.2s] principles\n[594.8s] of and by this allow me tell you\n[599.6s] that God has been leading a group of\n[603.7s] people and a brief history just on how\n[606.9s] evangelist was\n[612.7s] organized I know there are very many\n[615.0s] groups that are taking the\n[620.4s] message but allow me give you the\n[622.5s] history of people\n[629.5s] with church members who are sitting here\n[633.4s] today so that we might know how the Lord\n[635.5s] has led us in the\n[638.4s] past now there was a school opened by\n[641.4s] the general\n[645.2s] conference confence somewhere\n[648.5s] in the school was called in it short\n[654.5s] form in this school people stud the\n[657.0s] Bible\n[660.5s] and God gave them\n[663.0s] light and by\n[666.3s] this movement of young evangelist was\n[669.2s] organized in the year\n[675.7s] 2018 I'll try to be brief because of\n[680.2s] time so in 2018 the Evangelist Ministry\n[683.2s] was\n[686.8s] organized but you see the Church of God\n[688.9s] had been there\n[691.5s] before I I I had told you that it began\n[696.1s] from the Advent movement in\n[706.2s] 184 it began from 1844 down down the\n[712.8s] lineing that principle that\n[716.0s] I that God will choose another\n[718.3s] generation\n[720.9s] so the chist in 201 was\n[726.8s] organized and they began preaching the\n[729.0s] thirs message within the general\n[730.5s] conference\n[736.7s] churches in November\n[742.5s] 2018 Ministry was expelled from the\n[745.1s] general conference\n[752.1s] you can remember most of them were\n[753.6s] coming from\n[758.6s] conference so they were expelled from\n[761.0s] the\n[763.4s] conference some of them were just chased\n[766.2s] literally from\n[769.8s] churches they were expelled and they\n[771.8s] could not preach in those\n[775.1s] churches they came to and there was a\n[778.1s] church that welcome\n[781.7s] them and that is called\n[785.2s] Church they preach\n[788.6s] there in that\n[793.5s] church2 that church also expelled\n[799.7s] them in 201 when the ministry was\n[806.3s] organized they went and visited a place\n[808.9s] in\n[815.3s] they dist books and\n[822.7s] bibles together with cloes for those\n[828.9s] who the second second mission in they\n[835.3s] went by this time they were together\n[837.6s] with brother sad brother\n[840.0s] and\n[844.1s] [Music]\n[846.2s] together but today we still don't have\n[849.4s] other people within this group but they\n[850.6s] are also preaching somewhere\n[854.3s] else so missions there are several\n[856.7s] missions and several\n[861.8s] conventions in\n[864.8s] 2019 several conventions were held and\n[867.6s] people were coming into this convention\n[869.3s] to\n[873.8s] be and in\n[877.0s] 2019 they went and\n[884.1s] preach total number of 42 members were\n[890.7s] baptized\n[893.0s] uh a total number of 42 people were\n[896.1s] baptized\n[899.9s] and they established a church\n[903.4s] there that church was called Amazing\n[905.8s] Grace I\n[908.5s] think we have members from that\n[919.0s] place thank you\n[926.0s] for sometimes you can forget but thank\n[928.7s] God pioneers of the\n[934.8s] ministry I see the import of P by the\n[938.5s] [Music]\n[941.0s] way no apy apas\n[948.9s] comes so there are several missions that\n[952.3s] were\n[954.7s] done me come to20\n[959.4s] mission was done now\n[963.5s] in members\n[966.6s] baptized I remember\n[970.1s] there for\n[978.1s] Ministry Ministry is the ministry of our\n[980.8s] Elder Patrick\n[986.6s] there they met there\n[989.6s] by this time evangelist was preaching\n[995.2s] independently without the support of of\n[998.0s] these churches because they had been\n[1005.6s] expelled and allow me allow me allow me\n[1008.4s] come to 2021 because I see time is\n[1010.5s] running so\n[1013.0s] fast now\n[1015.6s] 2021 having been expelled from the\n[1018.1s] conference\n[1020.7s] we were asking ourselves how to how will\n[1022.9s] our camp\n[1027.3s] meetings according to the concept that\n[1029.5s] was\n[1037.5s] given the first

        "full_transcript": "to work for the salvation of men and women without presenting them the need of breaking away from the sinful gratifications which destroy what? So anything that is going to destroy health and debates the soul and prevent divine truth from impressing the mind must be discarded because what injures the health? It hinders physical, mental and what? spiritual and for us to be well all these things must be in harmony. Now in the education of children and youth because we are in a Bible convention. So it is very clear when you read that is child guidance page 392 paragraph 2 this is what it says in the education of children and youth they should be done what they should be taught that the habits of number one number two and number three dressing which have been formed after the world's standard are not in accordance with the laws of health and what and life they must be taught. Now read with me this book. This is a book of Romans 12 from verse one. 12:1 the book of Romans. What does it say? 12:1 the book of Romans. Someone from the congregation. As the Bible says, hey, beseech you therefore, I beseech you therefore, hey, by the mercies of God, it says, allow me to read. I beseech you, bre therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto which is your reasonable what? Service. So it means that God is calling us to present our bodies as a dead or a dying sacrifice living. As a living, what will happen when we present a dying or a dead sacrifice? Will it be acceptable unto God? No. So for it to be accepted, we must work diligently to give a living and a what? Read with me. That you present your bodies as a living sacrifice. Number one, holy and acceptable unto. Do you know that God, he cannot accept your service then reject you? Praise God. God will accept you with your sacrifice. Let me give you an example of Cain. God rejected accepted the sacrifice of Abel. And he also accepted Abel. When he rejected the sacrifice of Cain, he also rejected who? So God cannot actually accept your sacrifice then reject you. He first accepts you then accept the s the sacrifice because sacrifice cannot come by itself. It must come from you. So when we are called that we present our bodies, it is not actually spiritual. It is very physical and it should be understood in a literal way that we present this body as a living because God wants people who are healthy so that they may preach the gospel that he has given them. Praise God. And I know that we are going to see some of the things that are restoring our health. Be it the minutest of it, we are going to correct so that we be healthy the way God want us to be. Because when we are seeing sin, what are we seeing? We are seeing when we are seeing disease, we are seeing sin and its consequences. J. So when we are seeing sin, when we are seeing diseases, what should come in our minds? Sin. Now continue here. What will you say? You know many people you are telling them to come out of the what? To get out of the road. Why? Because there is something coming. What is he saying? What what is he saying? So what is it that is always common to us as human beings? When we are corrected, we are saying we are judged. When someone is correcting you not to fornicate, you are saying don't judge misjudgment or sin. When you are told to wear this and wear this, you are saying God's judgment is coming. And when you are corrected, you are saying don't judge me. Do you think this person is going to remain alive? Do you think will he remain alive? No. The same thing is coming because when we are not going to follow the laws of health here, what is going to result are diseases that is going to destroy our body and we are going to lose all our money. We are going to lose all our time in hospitals trying to restore that which you could have corrected with that simple change of lifestyle and when Christ is going to come you are going to suffer the consequences of misusing the health that he has given you. So my friends that is what is coming and when we are warning you to come out of it we are not judging anyone. So when we are going to say that braiding is not godly, it is something that is from men, it is devilish by nature itself, then we need to accept because God's judgment is coming to they that are calling his his name. But to believers and to not believe, then believe us. So don't say you are judged, but accept the call that you may move out of the way to be safe when the judgment come judgment comes. Praise God. Now this is how the pastor is preaching. This is how things happen when uh the preaches the truth is presented. God is just concerned with your heart. The way I dress does not matter. What did we read last time that our address are constant what? Constant preachers. Now let me continue. When you read this book testimonies to South Africa, this is 87 paragraph 2. It says, \"Educate, educate, educate in the what?\" In the dress, the words of scriptures in regard to dress should be carefully where you not talking should be carefully considered. We need to understand that which that which the Lord of heaven appreciates even the dressing of the bo of the body. So they must be carefully considered. When you don't consider them my friends, the the service you are offering it is not going to be accepted by God. You can be a good carer with a good voice. You can transpose your tenor but the way you dress makes God not to accept your your service. Another thing the working of the spirit of God uh the working of the spirit of God inwardly will show a change outward. That is why we read the book evangelism to 72 where we said that the question of grace will not be the main what because we have a lot of things that we need to be what to be studying or to be pointing to people that is that is Christ. So we said very well that it should be working from inward out. When Christ is in the art it will be shown outwardly. Now the fashion because this is the problem. The fashion. Where's my phone? The fashion. The fashion eco. I want to read you something here. The fashion. Mhm. Now when you read here uh the fashion is a tyrannical mistress. The fashion is a tyrant. Do you know someone who is a tyrant? Tyrant is like a dictator. This is the spirit of papacy. Tyrant is like a dictator. He dictates. He will not allow you to he will not give actually the room for argument. When he has said right right when he said left left, he will not allow the room for what? for argument. So you need to understand that fashion is a tyrannical what? Mistress. I want to give you something here. Passion being a tyrannical tyrannical mistress. Passion a tyrannical mistress. It says that fashion is deteriorating the intellect. Fashion is deteriorating the intellect and eating out the spirituality of our what? Of our people. You know the testimonies were not written to those people who are in the world. It were written to those people who are inside the church. So this message is for us. Can we be in the church yet fashion is eating our spirituality? Passion is deteriorating the intellect and eating out intellect and it is deteriorating the intellect and eating out the spirituality of our obedience to fashion is pervading our seventh day adventist. You know when we speaking of seventh day adventist churches we are not speaking of general conference because they are already in apostate they have become Babylon. So the seventh day adventist churches we are speaking about is you and I who have received the present what so we are seeing that obedience to fashion is pervading our seventh day Adventist church and is doing more than any other power to separate our people from who? So if there is a tool that the devil is going to use to separate us from God, what is it? So is it a subject that is worth consideration? Yes. Now get here. This is child guidance for 32 paragraph 1. It says fashion is a tyrannical ruler. That is the title. Fashion rules the world and she is a tyrannical mistress often compelling her devotees to submit to the greatest inconvenience and discomfort. fashion taxes without reason and collects without. Do you know tax? Are you getting the point now? It says that Uhhuh. He says that uhhuh often compelling her devotees to submit to the greatest inconvenience and discomfort. We are going to see how people are taxed into greatest inconvenience and their lives are being deteriorated and the only thing that they doing they're submitting to the to the fashion because as demanded she's a master. She's a master. And what is she paying is what is written in the book of Romans 6:23. The wages of sin is death. She will pay you debt. She will pay you diseases and she will make you to lie in nos and waste your time and resources. Now it's saying that fashion taxes without reason and collects without m. She has a fascinating power and stands ready to criticize. Do you know those people who love to who knows how to criticize when you tell him right? I think you know the critics he knows and stands ready to criticize and radical all who do not follow in her what in her wake but friends I've come to tell you that by following fashions we are not going to go far and in fact our people we are going to deteriorate at the greatest levels when our people are going to embrace fashions of the world. So we need to be very careful when it comes to issues of fashion because it was bringing a problem in the times of LG White and the same time it is bringing the problem today. Let me use the Babylonian 7th day Adventist while about their postit in a one in a in a in a in a choir you can find a video being recorded one single video of 3 minutes. Then in that one video it has the choir members by the end of the video change more than five there are more than what they're more than so are they advertising the clothes or what are they doing is it a fashion what how do you call it a fashion show where people are advertising the manner of clothes and people are competing of the of the fashion that have arrived of the beauty and everything. I want you to think of that and that is where you'll find that a member has 10 uniforms which the least amount is how many is how much 2,000 I'm 3,000 but does not have even a single B single Bible because people want to to reach the what the fashion very dangerous so fashion is a tyrannical mistress she's a dictator in fact the Bible says she not even he she is a a tyran helical mistress. Now when you read here there is a terrible curse by the way that is resting upon the church and as a people when we are not taking this in consideration there is a terrible curse coming. It says that a terrible curse rest upon the church for allowing improper dress in its what? In its members. He says there is a terrible sin upon us as a people that we have permitted our members to dress in a manner inconsistent with their what? So there is a dress that is consistent with our faith and there is a dress that is not inconsistent with our what? Now when we allow this dress to be in our place and we are not containing them, what will be the result? There is a terrible curse of God resting upon the responsible people. Praise God. Now, too little attention is generally given to the prevential preservation of health. It is far better to prevent disease than to know how to do what? How to treat it when contracted. When you read Proverbs 26:2, it says that we need to handle the disease from the cause to the what? To effect. Sor read this book, the book of Matthew 3:10. 3:10. The book of Matthew. Mhm. Verse 10, the Bible says, \"Uh-huh. And the Bible says, \"And now also, and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the what? Of the trees. Therefore, every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is healed down and cast into the what? Into the fire.\" So the tree by the way even when it comes to the principles of health the sister is giving us four principles to follow that the disease must be handled from the cost to what cause to effect and the same principle is being applied here because the book of Job says there is hope for a tree. It is only a tree that has not been cut from the root. That is that is the only tree that has hope. The same thing applies to the disease. The disease that has hope of coming back is a disease that has been handled from the what? From the effects to the cause. But when we handle a problem from its cause is like we are uprooting the tree. And when we uproot the tree there is no hope for that tree. It will never come back. And even for us today when these diseases that are disturbing people in their lives when we handle them from their courses then we have a sure result that they will never do what they will never come back. Now we need to be acquainted because the problem is we are not actually acquainted with our anatomy and what and our physiology the structure of how God created us. That is what is bringing the problem because for you to wear high heels that makes you now to walk this way. Do you think you understand your anatomy and physiology? You walk this way in the church. Do you think it is safe? Praise God. understood and that is the secret. Praise God. Let me continue. It says all need to become acquainted with their physical are you are you in class? They all need to become acquainted with their physical structure. That is anatomy and the laws that control natural laws and that is physio. He who remains in willing ignorance of the laws of phys is physical being and who violates them through ignorance is sinning against who? So ignorance concerning anatomy and physiology is a sin against who? So all of us must learn anatomy and what? So it says all should place themselves in the best possible relation to life and what our habits should be brought under the control of a mind that is itself under the control of God. So when you allow the tyrannical mistress to rule you, God is not ruling you. And that is why we are saying you are sinning against who? Against God. Now look upon this video. I want you to see I to see it kely. Down there. [Music] What time? Leave it. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] the video first. The body should be allowed to function as normal as possible. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Note that your body is the temple of who? Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of who? And you are not your what? You are bought with what? Therefore glorify God in your word and in your which are whose. So anything that is deteriorating our health, we need to correct on that. And that is why the spirit of prophecy is very clear that as the people of God dress message there is a need of us preaching the dress reform. When you read the book selected messages book two page 43 paragraph one it says that my sisters and my brothers there is a need of dress reform among us. We are wearing it is very wanting until there is no proper circulation of what? Of blood. Very dangerous. Now the other day I was speaking of the of the and I bring this to show you Go and look. I know one of us here. Are you seeing that? How many's parents feet are like that? I don't want to carry your hand. But how many wink s do you know the cause is because of small shoes? Get this. I want you to read with me this quotation. Uhhuh. This is a book uh the health reformer December 1st 1871 paragraph 10. It says the results of my friend's self-imposed miadom was the loss of health, peace of mind and natural beauty. She suffered the penalty of her folly in shattered nerves, swollen joints and deformed feet. The nails grew into her what? I could have showed you how the nails nails are growing inside the fle the flesh because do you think that is how God created that feet? What is the result? small small shoes this the nails. Okay. uh I don't know uh for example you see here when uh I I have a friend by the way in high school that he had to go to operation because of this go even in in Google Such such like for example a a a nail in the what? This is a a big a big toe I mean English nail in a big just you're going to see these things and they're going to see you to tell you even the effect the effects when this flesh many of the times It will not be the place of the what of the nail and you know the nail is growing naturally. So the the more the nail is growing and your grow and flesh it is not normal. They always feel pain and pass when pass and sometimes they go to operation so that this flesh to be cut so that the nail have a convenient space for it to grow and that is what is always happening there are medical research online and I've seen with my eyes those who know Evans I'm sorry for calling his name he suffered that thing in school. Now let me continue there. I think uh you now understand what I'm speaking about. Now let me continue here. I was reading health reformer page uh page what paragraph 10 that is pu 1871 December uh December 1st. It says that the nails grew into her flesh. That is a sup. The nails grew into her. The nails grew into her flesh. Nails can grow into your flesh when you compress your foot using your small shoes. The nails grew into her flesh. In ingrown tonally uh tone what? ing grown tonalist and caused the most extruding ex ex what excating suffering when I told her that this was in consequence of wearing what small so small shoes has a problem consequence of wearing small shoes she will not admit it she could not elevate is telling her So we need to correct that because you don't correct that it is a great problem and that is why the other time I was saying very well that when it comes to it is very dangerous for those people and you know when the leg is this way and I compress What? Do you see how it looks like the shape of a subooter? That is the thing. And says that these things make small shoes. It will not grow maturely the way it should be. That that is what will make a small child. Some of her easy to some are long and some deficient abnormal simply because they provide a good environment for it to grow natural. Naturally you are compressing it and that is very dangerous. Now I want to show you here what then should we teach? Teach the people how to prevent disease. Tell them to cease rebelling against what? Nature's laws. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of what? Of kiwa. An ounce of prevention is worth a what? A pound of of kiwa. Extremist or limbs should be covered. Now here another evil which custom fosters is the unequal distribution of clo of clothing. The feet and the limbs being removed from the vital organs should be especially guarded from cold by abundant water. Now the question can be asked that when the limbs should be because they are very far from the system they need to be covered more than anything. They need to be covered more than anything but most of us much of the stress all is okay. Now read here number one the health cannot be enjoyed where there is no unequal distribution of what circulation of the blood. Therefore we advocate that the limbs of women should not be exposed but sensibly neatly and comfortably what clad is the problem of the diseases. Another thing here what are the limbs? arms or what? Or legs of a person or a four-legged animal. So when I speak of the limbs, it is not actually but also the arms. Praise God. All of them are what are limbs. So when inspiration is saying that the limbs also should be covered, then does it does it say that we need to to cover both the arms and the feet? That is what it means. It is inappropriate. Uhhuh. Uh it says the limbs were not formed. That is 2T page 531 paragraph 3. The limbs were not formed by our creator to endure exposure as was the what? As was the face. They were not created to endure the same cold, to endure the same heat. It is only face protective to endure all those climates. But when it comes to the limbs, it was not it was not so. So when our limbs are facing the same environment, we are allowing them to face the same heat as is the what is the is the face then there is a problem. Another evil which are the feet another line there the feet and limbs being removed from the vital organs should be especially guarded from cold by abundant wash clothing. So from this do you think short sleeve? What do you think of short sleeve shirt? What do you think of short sleeve shirt? Sat shirt. What do you think of it? Praise God. What do you think of it? Is it dangerous to the health? Is it? Yes. Because the the limbs in no matter by the way sometimes when you go to these these places a lot of heatffected but the sometimes remains to be no to be normal and that is very dangerous in it is impossible to have health when the extremities are habitual what cooled for if there is too little blood in them there will be too much in the portions of the body and by the way headache not because there is of anything but because you've you've worn a a short sleeve shirt because once your arms are cold the blood is not going to be supplied there efficiently meaning that other parts of the body are going to have excess blood like the brain and that is what will be causing headache. Praise God. Now it says perfect health requires a perfect what but perfect circulation but this cannot be while there while three or four times as much clothing is worn upon the body as upon the feet and my friend is it so shortle in my chest and everything I've covered them But my limbs are they are free. Elen is saying you cannot have a perfect health because there is no way you can have three or four times as much clothing worn upon the body as upon the what the feet and and limbs. So when you read down the all of them we should give a equal distribution of heat in the in the body. Now let me give you another one here. The limbs and feet have large veins to receive large amount of blood that warmth, nutrition, elasticity and strength may be imparted to them. But when the blood is chilled from these extremities, the blood vessels contract which makes the circulation of the necessary amount of blood in them still more what? Difficult. So we need to give body actually easy time because when you don't give them easy time there is a problem. And we will be going to simply because of adaption or regular wearing of the long sleeved what charts. I want to read something here. Mhm. I want to give you something here. Uh-huh. The limbs. Our creator. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Just read. Our creator has formed. Our creator has formed the limbs with large veins and vessels to contain a large proportion of blood that the limbs may be sufficiently nourished and proportionately warmed with the other portions of the what? There must be equal distribution of heat in the bowl. But what robs the limbs of the coverings and the life current is chilled from its natural channel and thrown back upon its internal what? So what is depriving the limbs of what it requires passion there's a there is something I want to read for you so that you see all these things in a clear light. fashion child guidance for 27 paragraph one so that you see who brought these things we have sleeveless I didn't capture the photos here sleeveless cut book tople trousers short skirts All of those they are doing what? They're exposing our what? Our limbs. And we've said limbs concern the arms and the what? And the legs. Now read this quotation 427 paragraph one the book of what? Child guidance. It says Satan invented the fashions which leave the limbs exposed. may invent sleeveless may [Music] invents. Yes, by the way, the problem is do you think the arms are suffering? According to what we've read from the inspired word, they are suffering. So it says Satan invented the fashions which leave the limbs exposed chilling back the life current from its original course and parents bow at the shrine of fashion to uh and so clothe their children that the nerves and veins become contracted and do not answer the purpose that God designed they should. The result is habitually called feet and what hands. Those parents whose follow fashions instead of reason will have an account to render to God for thus robbing their children of health. This is parents being addressed. Do you know you'll have an account to render before God? By the way, most of the children and you know the Bible says that we need to teach our little children that God is not happy when seeing them in torn and filthy garments. Do you know that? And you know that the truth cannot place its delicate feet in the filthy environment. Praise God. So how will you convince this child up that he need to be neat? When he was young, you allowed him to roam around with torn garments and everything. Praise God. Very dangerous. So it says that parents, my friends, will have to give an account when you allow your children to roam around with what? with short-sleeved clothes. You don't cover their limbs well and they suffer diseases. You take them to hospital, they are dragged to death and some are laid under grave because of improper what? Immodesty dress. So we need to change and even for us for our ministers when you go to to buy a shirt from the inspiration you need actually to embrace the long sleeved what? Because it will be the one that will be complying to what is written. I want to show you something here. How do we clothe our bodies to maintain this proper what? Circulation. The limbs which should have even more covering than any other portion of the what? Because of their farthest from the center of the circulation are often not suitably protected while over the vital organs. Uhhuh. It says while over the vital organs where there is naturally more warmth than in any other portion of the body there is an undue proportion of what of covering from from the pain of inspiration we need to give burden upon clothing our limbs because they are far from heart and for them to maintain a proper circulation of the blood they need to be held by proper cover. Are we going back to the fig leaves or are we embracing the uh uh the the what the coats of skin that God clothed with Adam and Eve? That is the question I want you to read here. We must cover our limbs be it summer or what at all seasons bear arms and bear arms and leg. We think we think this mode of dressing must be recorded as one of the most prominent causes of uh prominent causes of summer compliance. In colder weather, congestion and inflammation of the lungs, congestion and inflammations of the brain, convulsions etc will result at all seasons. Congestion more or less is what is caused simply because of what is called uncovering of the limbs. I want to show you something here called the next list after this where I'm going to list the diseases that comes as a result that we are not closing our covering our limbs. So it says special attention special attention should be given to the extremities that they may be thoroughly they may be as thoroughly do you know what is thorough they may be as thoroughly clothed as the chest and the region over the what over the heart where the greatest amount of heat where is the greatest amount of the heat in order to equalize the circulation of the blood the clothing should be equally distributed upon the p upon the person that that equal warmth may be preserved in all parts of the what of the body. Now health problems related to not covering the arms and the limbs. The list is long but I've just given these ones for a start. Number one you have short shortness of breath for those who have experienced this. This is this is true. Many people are suffering this headaches, nose bleedings. You can just be nos bleeding because of this problem. The body is not is not heavenly distributed. We have the fullness in chest chest problem because of unequal distribution of heat in the body because we are not covering our limbs. Palputation of the heart. Irritation and restless heart failure. This thing my friends in a letter had what is called heart failure. Let me go back to children. The lips of our children should be done what? Thoroughly and score that should be thoroughly and sensibly covered or clad. Parents who dress their children with extremities naked or nearly so are sacrificing the health and the lives of their children to what? But you know that there is another altar here that people are sacrificing their children on. What is that altar? the order of her of not covering the limbs of the children. Let me repeat this quotation. Parents who parents who who dress their children with the extremities naked or merely so are sacrificing the health and their lives. Not just the health but also the what of their children to the what? To the fashion. Children are killed. Which commandment is that? Do not kill. Six cind get what the parents are doing? Children are killed by the manner in which they are watched. So when you have your siblings here, you need to take notes of this because many children are killed by the parents and by their siblings in which in the manner of which they what they are dressed left with bare arms and legs and with low naked what? dresses. It is a sin in the sight of heaven for parents to dress their children as the way they do. It is a sin before in the sight of heaven for parents to dress their children the way they are doing. Judgment shall run or shall rest upon the what? Upon the parents. How many are seeing that we need actually we need a reformation on this issue? May God help us because when God is not going to help us on this many of our children are going to be laid on grave because of very simple issues other related problems in digestion not because of but because of improper what you're not covering the extremities in a letter by the way praise Extraring constipating nerves and veins become contracted causing bad circulation. And by the way, this list comprises also when you're on a bad tight tight tight skin tight tight. Now it says uhhuh edma congestion of the lungs and everything. You can screenshot that it is online. I don't know our technician is not around. I don't know how we are helping those people online. Uhhuh. And many other more. Now I read this that who is the inventor of the sleeveless? Who is the inventor of the short sleeves? Who is the inventor of shorts? Who is the inventor of short skirts? Satan invents the version which leaves the limbs what? Exposed. It is Satan's design so to pervert every function of our being that life may be made miserable and God may be dishonored in the creation in the creatures he had he had created. Satan plans and pre premeditates ways that we can be made miserable. Satan kill a kill a time kill a time in how can I make the health of these people miserable very small praise God because he wants your health to be deteriorated because he knows that when your health is infled You cannot give God the perfect the perfect service that you ought to have given him. It is a solemn statement beloved on one a one that should take us to our knees. It is a it is a solemn statement one that should take us to our knees possibly before our wardrobe and make some decisions. Do you know that after this two weeks we need when we go back home we need to go back to our what our wardrobe. Do you know what is a wardrobe? Do you know that the some of us came with with clothes that we need to go back to our wardrobes and make a decision? It says certain plans and pre pre what meditates ways that we can be made miserable. How many are miserable because they are not dressing properly? How many? millions. It is a solemn statement, one that should take us to our knees. It is a solemn statement that should take us to our knees possibly be uh before our wardrobes and make what? Some decisions. Praise God. Charity. Which charity? Which charity is that? Is it charity? Is it a charitable work? What is the solution for that? If medical books are banned, what of dress? They need to be another thing. Because my friends there are some by the way you can modify so that and by the way you have some short sleeves maybe I don't say because we have this these are small you can put that short sleeve inside inside it is presentable for that praise God and it will help you to to distribute it heavenly now dress from reason and what don't just dress because don't just dress. Sometimes you need even to pray before you dress. It is manifest that most women do not think and act in reverence to dress from reason and reflect. They accept without questioning that which imposes upon what? Upon them. You are not dressing out of reason and reflection. You need to dress out of reason and what? Reflection. Another point in the preparation of the clothing, can you actually seek God's blessings on that? Do you think you can do that? May you bless this that God thank you for how many are always praying. Praise God. How many always pray? Let me connect this with the first angel's message. And I I saw another angel that is Revelation 14:6. And I saw another angel flying in the midst of what? Having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the on the what? And to and to every nation kindred and and he said with what? with a loud voice that we need to do what? We need to fear God. Number one to fear and give glory. Why? For the hour of his judgment is what? Did you see the guy showed you is the hour of judgment is coming? Yes. What should we do? We should we need to fear God and give glory. And what does the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 10:31, what does it say? Uh-huh. Whatsoever. Uh-huh. Let me read it. Says, \"Wherefore whatsoever you eat or drink or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of who?\" Of God. So, by the way, is dressing something we do? Yes. Now when we are dressing we need to do it to the glory of and that is why when we are dressing up we need even to give we need to pray over it so that our dressing be of good influence upon nonbelievers and also upon the believers. We need to ask God is my dress giving glory and honor to you because when it is not doing that then it is contrary to the spirit of the gospel. To bring this to a close, it says when they really desire, I would ask, let me start in the preparation of their clothing, can they seek the Lord's blessing? I would ask of today who profess to believe present truth when they really desire an article of dress or some of convenience. Do they lay the matter before the Lord in prayer? Do you present that before that when you go sanctioned to know if his spirit will sanction that now beloved we need actually to make a change because when you don't make a change in this there is a great issue that is awaiting us and God is calling upon his children and when God is calling upon on his children. It is very serious. It is something that is worth consideration. It is worth consideration and I'll not talk of that. Women are always what are too often tempters. They are too often tempters. If women would only elevate their lives, they will be less danger through their what? Through their influence. Do you know that there are many people who are in the nin they are in the they're in the prisons because of how someone dressed somewhere. Do you know that they're in prisons because of how someone dressed somewhere and he was tempted and he raped today is in prison maybe for 30 years because someone who professed to be a seventh day Adventist somewhere somewhere and I wish that God may help us. We need to be daughters of Zion and we need not the daughters of God of Babylon. And it is time to change you. What was what was what was our topic? The Christian modesty. What was the subtopic? Dress, fashion, and what? And health. How many have understood something? May God bless us in Jesus name. Allow me to pray. Our heavenly father in heaven, we thank you because of your love that you have given us. I thank you because of the message of dress which is an index to our heart. May you help your children to be convicted upon their thoughts to make a sound decision that shall glorify your name. Forgive us of our past ignorances and where we had messed up and multiply us grace to ensure that we comply to your will which is the demands of heaven. Be with us I pray in Jesus holy name. Thank you. I to give uh uh some",
        "timestamped_transcript": "[0.6s] to work for the salvation of men and\n[2.9s] women without presenting them the need\n[5.4s] of breaking away from the sinful\n[8.8s] gratifications which destroy what? So\n[11.9s] anything that is going to destroy health\n[14.2s] and debates the soul and prevent divine\n[16.9s] truth from impressing the mind must be\n[21.6s] discarded because what injures the\n[24.1s] health? It hinders physical, mental and\n[28.2s] what? spiritual and for us to be well\n[31.5s] all these things must be in harmony. Now\n[35.4s] in the education of children and youth\n[38.2s] because we are in a Bible convention. So\n[40.6s] it is very clear when you read that is\n[42.3s] child guidance page 392 paragraph 2 this\n[46.9s] is what it says in the education of\n[49.3s] children and youth they should be done\n[52.2s] what they should be taught that the\n[55.5s] habits of number one number two and\n[59.4s] number three dressing which have been\n[63.0s] formed after the world's standard are\n[65.6s] not in accordance with the laws of\n[67.2s] health and what and life they must be\n[71.0s] taught. Now read with me this book. This\n[72.9s] is a book of Romans 12 from verse\n[77.7s] one. 12:1 the book of\n[81.0s] Romans. What does it\n[84.0s] say? 12:1 the book of Romans. Someone\n[87.4s] from the\n[90.0s] congregation. As the Bible\n[92.2s] says, hey, beseech you therefore, I\n[95.4s] beseech you therefore,\n[98.7s] hey, by the mercies of\n[103.1s] God, it says, allow me to read. I\n[105.7s] beseech you, bre therefore, brethren, by\n[108.0s] the mercies of God that you present your\n[110.6s] bodies a living sacrifice, holy,\n[114.1s] acceptable\n[115.3s] unto which is your reasonable what?\n[118.2s] Service. So it means that God is calling\n[122.0s] us to present our bodies as a dead or a\n[125.4s] dying sacrifice\n[127.2s] living. As a\n[129.5s] living, what will happen when we present\n[132.3s] a dying or a dead\n[134.4s] sacrifice? Will it be acceptable unto\n[136.9s] God? No. So for it to be accepted, we\n[140.4s] must work diligently to give a living\n[144.3s] and a what?\n[146.6s] Read with me. That you present your\n[148.8s] bodies as a living sacrifice. Number\n[152.0s] one, holy and acceptable unto. Do you\n[156.6s] know that\n[157.5s] God, he cannot accept your\n[160.4s] service then reject you? Praise God. God\n[164.7s] will accept you with your sacrifice. Let\n[167.7s] me give you an example of\n[169.6s] Cain. God rejected accepted the\n[173.9s] sacrifice of Abel.\n[176.6s] And he also accepted\n[179.6s] Abel. When he rejected the sacrifice of\n[182.6s] Cain, he also rejected who? So God\n[186.4s] cannot actually accept your sacrifice\n[189.0s] then reject you. He first accepts you\n[193.3s] then accept the s the sacrifice because\n[196.1s] sacrifice cannot come by itself. It must\n[198.4s] come from you. So when we are called\n[202.3s] that we present our bodies, it is not\n[204.6s] actually spiritual. It is very physical\n[206.6s] and it should be understood in a literal\n[208.3s] way that we present this body as a\n[211.7s] living because God wants people who are\n[215.0s] healthy so that they may preach the\n[217.2s] gospel that he has given them. Praise\n[218.8s] God. And I know that we are going to see\n[221.5s] some of the things that are restoring\n[222.9s] our health. Be it the minutest of it, we\n[225.4s] are going to correct so that we be\n[226.9s] healthy the way God want us to be.\n[229.4s] Because when we are seeing sin, what are\n[231.0s] we seeing? We are seeing when we are\n[233.7s] seeing disease, we are seeing sin and\n[235.8s] its\n[236.9s] consequences.\n[243.0s] J. So when we are seeing sin, when we\n[245.8s] are seeing diseases, what should come in\n[247.4s] our\n[248.4s] minds?\n[250.0s] Sin. Now continue\n[252.6s] here. What will you say? You know many\n[256.2s] people you are telling them to come out\n[258.6s] of the\n[260.0s] what? To get out of the road. Why?\n[263.6s] Because there is something\n[273.7s] coming. What is he\n[277.2s] saying? What what is he\n[279.9s] saying? So what is it that is always\n[282.6s] common to us as human beings? When we\n[284.2s] are corrected, we are saying we are\n[287.0s] judged. When someone is correcting you\n[289.3s] not to fornicate, you are saying don't\n[292.4s] judge misjudgment or sin. When you are\n[294.6s] told to wear this and wear this, you are\n[296.8s] saying God's judgment is coming. And\n[299.5s] when you are corrected, you are saying\n[302.0s] don't judge\n[304.0s] me. Do you think this person is going to\n[306.3s] remain alive?\n[308.6s] Do you\n[309.6s] think will he remain\n[315.0s] alive? No. The same thing is\n[318.4s] coming because when we are not going to\n[321.5s] follow the laws of health here, what is\n[323.8s] going to result are\n[326.0s] diseases that is going to destroy our\n[328.6s] body and we are going to lose all our\n[331.4s] money. We are going to lose all our time\n[334.0s] in hospitals trying to restore that\n[336.2s] which you could have corrected with that\n[338.0s] simple change of\n[339.5s] lifestyle and when Christ is going to\n[341.7s] come you are going to suffer the\n[343.4s] consequences of misusing the health that\n[345.4s] he has given you. So my friends that is\n[348.0s] what is coming and when we are warning\n[350.0s] you to come out of it we are not judging\n[353.4s] anyone. So when we are going to say that\n[356.0s] braiding is not godly, it is something\n[358.7s] that is from men, it is devilish by\n[361.8s] nature itself, then we need to accept\n[363.8s] because God's judgment is coming to they\n[366.0s] that are calling his his name. But to\n[368.6s] believers and to not believe, then\n[371.0s] believe us. So don't say you are judged,\n[373.4s] but accept the call that you may move\n[375.4s] out of the way to be safe when the\n[377.1s] judgment come judgment comes. Praise\n[379.4s] God.\n[380.8s] Now this is how the pastor is\n[387.6s] preaching. This is how things happen\n[391.0s] when uh the preaches the truth is\n[393.6s] presented. God is just concerned with\n[395.8s] your heart. The way I dress does not\n[398.5s] matter. What did we read last time that\n[401.9s] our address are constant what? Constant\n[404.2s] preachers. Now let me continue. When you\n[406.4s] read this book testimonies to South\n[408.2s] Africa, this is 87 paragraph 2. It says,\n[411.6s] \"Educate, educate, educate in the what?\"\n[415.8s] In the dress, the words of scriptures in\n[418.3s] regard to dress should be\n[422.5s] carefully where you not talking should\n[424.9s] be carefully considered. We need to\n[427.7s] understand that which that which the\n[429.9s] Lord of heaven appreciates even the\n[433.3s] dressing of the bo of the body. So they\n[436.0s] must be carefully considered. When you\n[438.7s] don't consider them my friends, the the\n[440.9s] service you are offering it is not going\n[442.6s] to be accepted by God. You can be a good\n[444.9s] carer with a good voice. You can\n[446.6s] transpose your tenor but the way you\n[449.2s] dress makes God not to accept your your\n[453.8s] service. Another thing the working of\n[456.3s] the spirit of God uh the working of the\n[459.4s] spirit of God inwardly will show a\n[462.5s] change outward. That is why we read the\n[465.7s] book evangelism to 72 where we said that\n[469.4s] the question of grace will not be the\n[470.9s] main what because we have a lot of\n[473.0s] things that we need to be what to be\n[474.9s] studying or to be pointing to people\n[476.4s] that is that is Christ. So we said very\n[479.2s] well that it should be working from\n[481.2s] inward out. When Christ is in the art it\n[484.7s] will be shown outwardly.\n[490.3s] Now the\n[492.4s] fashion because this is the problem. The\n[496.3s] fashion. Where's my phone? The\n[499.6s] fashion. The\n[504.4s] fashion eco. I want to read you\n[507.7s] something\n[511.7s] here. The\n[515.5s] fashion. Mhm.\n[517.9s] Now when you read here uh the fashion is\n[521.0s] a tyrannical mistress. The fashion is a\n[525.3s] tyrant. Do you know someone who is a\n[527.7s] tyrant? Tyrant is like a\n[530.4s] dictator. This is the spirit of papacy.\n[533.6s] Tyrant is like a dictator. He dictates.\n[537.3s] He will not allow you to he will not\n[539.8s] give actually the room for argument.\n[541.8s] When he has said right right when he\n[543.7s] said left left, he will not allow the\n[546.0s] room for what? for argument. So you need\n[548.1s] to understand that fashion is a\n[549.5s] tyrannical what? Mistress. I want to\n[551.7s] give you something here. Passion being a\n[554.9s] tyrannical\n[556.7s] tyrannical\n[558.3s] mistress. Passion a\n[560.9s] tyrannical mistress.\n[572.6s] It says that fashion is\n[575.8s] deteriorating the intellect.\n[583.2s] Fashion is deteriorating the intellect\n[587.0s] and eating out the spirituality of our\n[590.1s] what? Of our people. You know the\n[592.7s] testimonies were not written to those\n[594.3s] people who are in the world. It were\n[597.0s] written to those people who are inside\n[598.3s] the church. So this message is for us.\n[602.2s] Can we be in the church yet fashion is\n[604.2s] eating our\n[605.9s] spirituality? Passion is deteriorating\n[608.4s] the intellect and eating out\n[611.6s] intellect and it is deteriorating the\n[614.8s] intellect and eating out the\n[616.6s] spirituality of\n[618.6s] our obedience to fashion is pervading\n[622.3s] our seventh day adventist.\n[625.0s] You know when we speaking of seventh day\n[626.7s] adventist churches we are not speaking\n[628.2s] of general conference because they are\n[630.2s] already in apostate they have become\n[632.5s] Babylon. So the seventh day adventist\n[634.6s] churches we are speaking about is you\n[636.3s] and I who have received the present what\n[639.5s] so we are seeing that obedience to\n[641.7s] fashion is pervading our seventh day\n[644.3s] Adventist church and is doing more than\n[646.9s] any other power to separate our people\n[649.8s] from\n[650.8s] who? So if there is a tool that the\n[653.8s] devil is going to use to separate us\n[655.6s] from God, what is\n[657.2s] it? So is it a subject that is worth\n[660.8s] consideration? Yes. Now get here. This\n[664.5s] is child guidance for 32 paragraph 1. It\n[666.3s] says fashion is a tyrannical ruler. That\n[669.3s] is the title. Fashion rules the world\n[672.0s] and she is a tyrannical mistress often\n[676.0s] compelling her devotees to submit to the\n[679.1s] greatest inconvenience and discomfort.\n[682.2s] fashion taxes without reason and\n[685.0s] collects\n[686.0s] without. Do you\n[700.8s] know\n[703.7s] tax? Are you getting the point now? It\n[706.7s] says that Uhhuh. He says\n[711.2s] that uhhuh often compelling her devotees\n[715.0s] to submit to the greatest inconvenience\n[717.4s] and discomfort. We are going to see how\n[719.8s] people are taxed into greatest\n[722.5s] inconvenience and their lives are being\n[724.9s] deteriorated and the only thing that\n[726.8s] they doing they're submitting to the to\n[729.0s] the\n[732.6s] fashion because as\n[736.0s] demanded she's a master. She's a master.\n[740.2s] And what is she paying is what is\n[742.5s] written in the book of Romans 6:23. The\n[745.2s] wages of sin is death. She will pay you\n[748.3s] debt. She will pay you diseases and she\n[750.3s] will make you to lie in nos and waste\n[752.2s] your time and\n[753.6s] resources. Now it's saying that fashion\n[756.6s] taxes without reason and collects\n[758.6s] without m. She has a fascinating power\n[762.4s] and stands ready to\n[764.8s] criticize. Do you know those people who\n[766.7s] love to who knows how to\n[768.8s] criticize when you tell him\n[771.9s] right? I think you know the critics he\n[775.8s] knows and stands ready to criticize and\n[778.7s] radical all who do not follow in her\n[781.2s] what in her wake but friends I've come\n[783.8s] to tell you that by following fashions\n[786.9s] we are not going to go far and in fact\n[789.7s] our people we are going to\n[794.0s] deteriorate at the greatest levels when\n[797.0s] our people are going to embrace fashions\n[799.0s] of the world. So we need to be very\n[801.4s] careful when it comes to issues of\n[803.6s] fashion because it was bringing a\n[805.4s] problem in the times of LG White and the\n[807.8s] same time it is bringing the problem\n[809.3s] today. Let me use the Babylonian 7th day\n[811.9s] Adventist while about their\n[814.9s] postit in a one in a in a in a in a\n[818.3s] choir you can find a video being\n[821.2s] recorded one single video of 3 minutes.\n[824.9s] Then in that one video it has the choir\n[829.6s] members by the end of the\n[832.6s] video change more than\n[835.3s] five there are more than what they're\n[838.6s] more\n[839.6s] than so are they advertising the clothes\n[843.3s] or what are they doing is it a fashion\n[845.1s] what how do you call it a fashion show\n[848.4s] where people are advertising the manner\n[850.2s] of clothes and people are competing of\n[852.2s] the of the fashion that have arrived of\n[854.5s] the beauty and\n[855.7s] everything. I want you to think of that\n[858.6s] and that is where you'll find that a\n[860.1s] member has 10 uniforms which the least\n[863.4s] amount is how many is how much 2,000 I'm\n[868.2s] 3,000 but does not have even a single B\n[871.4s] single Bible because people want to to\n[873.9s] reach the what the fashion very\n[876.5s] dangerous so fashion is a tyrannical\n[879.5s] mistress she's a dictator in fact the\n[882.7s] Bible says she not even he she is a a\n[886.2s] tyran helical\n[888.0s] mistress. Now when you read\n[891.6s] here there is a terrible curse by the\n[894.8s] way that is resting upon the church and\n[897.4s] as a people when we are not taking this\n[899.1s] in consideration there is a terrible\n[901.2s] curse coming. It says that a terrible\n[903.8s] curse rest upon the church for allowing\n[906.3s] improper dress in its\n[908.3s] what? In its members. He says there is a\n[912.0s] terrible sin upon us as a people that we\n[915.5s] have permitted our members to dress in a\n[918.7s] manner inconsistent with their what? So\n[922.0s] there is a dress that is consistent with\n[923.9s] our faith and there is a dress that is\n[926.2s] not inconsistent with our what? Now when\n[929.0s] we allow this dress to be in our place\n[931.5s] and we are not containing them, what\n[933.6s] will be the result? There is a terrible\n[935.6s] curse of God resting upon the\n[937.6s] responsible\n[939.3s] people. Praise God.\n[943.8s] Now, too little attention is generally\n[947.2s] given to the prevential preservation of\n[949.9s] health. It is far better to prevent\n[952.5s] disease than to know how to do what? How\n[955.8s] to treat it when contracted. When you\n[958.9s] read Proverbs 26:2, it says that we need\n[962.1s] to handle the disease from the cause to\n[965.0s] the what? To effect. Sor read this book,\n[969.0s] the book of Matthew\n[970.7s] 3:10. 3:10. The book of Matthew.\n[978.6s] Mhm.\n[980.9s] Verse 10, the Bible says,\n[986.3s] \"Uh-huh.\n[990.5s] And the Bible says, \"And now also, and\n[993.8s] now also the axe is laid unto the root\n[997.5s] of the what? Of the trees. Therefore,\n[1001.2s] every tree which bringeth not forth good\n[1004.0s] fruit is healed down and cast into the\n[1007.4s] what? Into the fire.\" So the tree by the\n[1010.8s] way even when it comes to the principles\n[1012.6s] of health the sister is giving us four\n[1015.6s] principles to follow that the disease\n[1018.0s] must be handled from the cost to what\n[1020.8s] cause to effect and the same principle\n[1023.5s] is being applied here because the book\n[1025.1s] of Job says there is hope for a tree. It\n[1028.8s] is only a tree that has not been cut\n[1030.9s] from the root. That is that is the only\n[1032.6s] tree that has hope. The same thing\n[1034.5s] applies to the disease. The disease that\n[1036.6s] has hope of coming back is a disease\n[1039.0s] that has been handled from the what?\n[1041.8s] From the effects to the cause. But when\n[1044.2s] we handle a problem from its cause is\n[1047.2s] like we are uprooting the tree. And when\n[1049.9s] we uproot the tree there is no hope for\n[1052.0s] that tree. It will never come back. And\n[1055.0s] even for us today when these diseases\n[1057.8s] that are disturbing people in their\n[1059.1s] lives when we handle them from their\n[1062.0s] courses then we have a sure result that\n[1064.6s] they will never do what they will never\n[1066.7s] come back. Now we need to be acquainted\n[1071.0s] because the problem is we are not\n[1073.5s] actually acquainted with our anatomy and\n[1075.5s] what and our physiology the structure of\n[1079.2s] how God created us. That is what is\n[1081.7s] bringing the problem because for you to\n[1084.2s] wear high heels that makes you now to\n[1086.4s] walk this way. Do you think you\n[1088.0s] understand your anatomy and physiology?\n[1089.8s] You walk this way in the church.\n[1110.5s] Do you think it is safe? Praise\n[1121.2s] God.\n[1122.8s] understood and that is the\n[1129.6s] secret. Praise\n[1132.2s] God. Let me continue. It says all need\n[1135.2s] to become acquainted with their\n[1138.1s] physical are you are you in class? They\n[1141.8s] all need to become acquainted with their\n[1144.7s] physical structure. That is\n[1147.5s] anatomy and the laws that control\n[1150.4s] natural laws and that is physio. He who\n[1154.6s] remains in willing ignorance of the laws\n[1158.1s] of phys is physical being and who\n[1160.5s] violates them through ignorance is\n[1163.0s] sinning against who? So ignorance\n[1166.0s] concerning anatomy and physiology is a\n[1167.8s] sin against who? So all of us must learn\n[1170.8s] anatomy and what? So it says all should\n[1174.4s] place themselves in the best possible\n[1177.6s] relation to life and what our habits\n[1181.4s] should be brought under the control of a\n[1183.5s] mind that is itself under the control of\n[1186.3s] God. So when you allow the tyrannical\n[1189.0s] mistress to rule you, God is not ruling\n[1191.8s] you. And that is why we are saying you\n[1193.7s] are sinning against who? Against God.\n[1196.1s] Now look upon this\n[1201.5s] video. I want you to see\n[1219.2s] I to see it kely.\n[1277.2s] Down there.\n[1282.0s] [Music]\n[1318.6s] What\n[1320.8s] time? Leave it.\n[1332.6s] [Music]\n[1352.0s] Heat.\n[1353.6s] [Music]\n[1359.4s] Heat. Heat. Heat.\n[1365.7s] [Music]\n[1397.0s] the video first.\n[1466.3s] The body should be allowed to function\n[1468.5s] as normal as possible.\n[1483.1s] [Music]\n[1495.0s] Heat. Heat.\n[1496.9s] [Music]\n[1528.6s] Note that your body is the temple of\n[1531.2s] who? Your body is the temple of the Holy\n[1534.6s] Ghost which is in you which you have of\n[1538.1s] who? And you are not your what? You are\n[1542.0s] bought with what? Therefore glorify God\n[1544.9s] in your word and in your which are\n[1548.6s] whose. So anything that is deteriorating\n[1551.3s] our health, we need to correct on that.\n[1554.8s] And that is why the spirit of prophecy\n[1557.2s] is very clear that as the people of God\n[1559.8s] dress message there is a need of us\n[1562.6s] preaching the dress reform. When you\n[1564.2s] read the book selected messages book two\n[1565.8s] page 43 paragraph one it says that my\n[1569.0s] sisters and my brothers there is a need\n[1571.8s] of dress reform among us.\n[1575.9s] We are\n[1582.4s] wearing it is very\n[1588.5s] wanting until there is no proper\n[1590.5s] circulation of what? Of blood. Very\n[1593.6s] dangerous. Now the other day I was\n[1596.9s] speaking of the of\n[1598.9s] the and I bring this to show you\n[1607.0s] Go and\n[1608.4s] look. I know one of us\n[1614.7s] here. Are you seeing that? How many's\n[1617.5s] parents feet are like\n[1619.2s] that? I don't want to carry your hand.\n[1622.2s] But how many wink\n[1625.5s] s do you know the cause is because of\n[1628.1s] small\n[1629.2s] shoes? Get this. I want you to read with\n[1632.0s] me this\n[1635.4s] quotation. Uhhuh. This is a book uh the\n[1638.2s] health reformer December 1st 1871\n[1641.2s] paragraph 10. It says the results of my\n[1643.4s] friend's self-imposed miadom was the\n[1647.8s] loss of health, peace of mind and\n[1651.2s] natural beauty. She suffered the penalty\n[1654.3s] of her folly in shattered nerves,\n[1657.7s] swollen joints and deformed feet. The\n[1661.8s] nails grew into her what? I could have\n[1665.2s] showed\n[1666.6s] you how the\n[1668.8s] nails nails are growing inside the fle\n[1672.5s] the flesh\n[1675.3s] because do you think that is how God\n[1677.4s] created that\n[1678.7s] feet? What is the result?\n[1682.4s] small small\n[1686.8s] shoes this the\n[1691.1s] nails. Okay. uh I don't know\n[1696.2s] uh for example you see here when uh I I\n[1700.6s] have a friend by the way in high school\n[1702.2s] that he had to go to operation because\n[1704.2s] of\n[1717.3s] this go even in in Google\n[1721.4s] Such such like for\n[1724.4s] example a a a nail in the what? This is\n[1729.0s] a a big a big toe I mean English nail in\n[1734.0s] a big just you're going to see these\n[1735.8s] things and they're going to see you to\n[1737.9s] tell you even the effect the effects\n[1740.6s] when this\n[1745.2s] flesh many of the times\n[1752.2s] It will not\n[1758.2s] be the place of the what of the nail and\n[1761.3s] you know the nail is growing\n[1763.4s] naturally. So the the more the nail is\n[1766.1s] growing and\n[1770.4s] your\n[1772.4s] grow\n[1774.7s] and flesh it is not normal. They always\n[1777.8s] feel pain\n[1783.7s] and pass when pass and sometimes they go\n[1787.8s] to operation so that this flesh to be\n[1790.0s] cut so that the nail have a convenient\n[1793.8s] space for it to grow and that is what is\n[1796.6s] always\n[1797.4s] happening there are medical research\n[1800.1s] online and I've seen with my eyes those\n[1802.7s] who know Evans I'm sorry for calling his\n[1805.6s] name he suffered that thing in\n[1809.7s] school. Now let me continue there. I\n[1813.0s] think uh you now understand what I'm\n[1815.2s] speaking\n[1816.9s] about.\n[1818.4s] Now let me continue\n[1822.8s] here. I was reading health reformer page\n[1825.7s] uh page what paragraph 10 that is pu\n[1828.6s] 1871 December\n[1831.4s] uh December 1st. It says that the nails\n[1834.8s] grew into her flesh. That is a sup. The\n[1837.6s] nails grew into her. The nails grew into\n[1841.3s] her flesh. Nails can grow into your\n[1843.0s] flesh when you compress your foot using\n[1846.2s] your small\n[1847.4s] shoes. The nails grew into her\n[1851.9s] flesh. In ingrown tonally uh tone what?\n[1859.4s] ing grown tonalist and caused the most\n[1863.4s] extruding ex ex what excating suffering\n[1868.2s] when I told her that this was in\n[1870.2s] consequence of wearing what\n[1873.8s] small so small shoes has a\n[1876.6s] problem consequence of wearing small\n[1879.4s] shoes she will not admit\n[1883.6s] it she could not elevate is telling her\n[1893.2s] So we need to correct that because you\n[1895.8s] don't correct that it is a great problem\n[1898.6s] and that is why the other time I was\n[1900.2s] saying very well that when it comes to\n[1903.5s] it is very dangerous for those\n[1912.5s] people and you know when the leg is this\n[1915.6s] way and I compress\n[1923.6s] What? Do you see how it looks\n[1926.2s] like the shape of a subooter? That is\n[1929.6s] the\n[1931.4s] thing. And says that these things\n[1936.9s] make small\n[1942.4s] shoes. It will not grow maturely the way\n[1945.6s] it should\n[1947.0s] be. That that is what will make a small\n[1950.0s] child. Some of her easy to some are long\n[1955.3s] and some deficient abnormal simply\n[1959.1s] because they provide a good environment\n[1961.8s] for it to grow natural. Naturally you\n[1964.2s] are compressing it and that is very\n[1966.9s] dangerous. Now I want to show you here\n[1969.0s] what then should we teach? Teach the\n[1971.0s] people how to prevent disease. Tell them\n[1973.7s] to cease rebelling against what?\n[1977.5s] Nature's\n[1979.3s] laws. An ounce of prevention is worth a\n[1982.6s] pound of\n[1983.9s] what?\n[1986.7s] Of kiwa. An ounce of prevention is worth\n[1990.8s] a what? A pound of of kiwa. Extremist or\n[1995.8s] limbs should be covered. Now here\n[1998.4s] another evil which custom fosters is the\n[2003.2s] unequal distribution of clo of clothing.\n[2006.4s] The feet and the limbs being removed\n[2008.3s] from the vital organs should be\n[2010.2s] especially guarded from cold by abundant\n[2013.4s] water. Now the question can be asked\n[2017.2s] that when the\n[2019.7s] limbs should be because they are very\n[2022.7s] far from the system they need to be\n[2024.3s] covered more than anything. They need to\n[2026.9s] be covered more than anything but most\n[2029.0s] of\n[2031.6s] us much of the\n[2035.7s] stress all is okay. Now read here number\n[2038.2s] one the health cannot be enjoyed where\n[2040.3s] there is no unequal distribution of what\n[2042.6s] circulation of the blood. Therefore we\n[2045.2s] advocate that the limbs of women should\n[2047.8s] not be exposed but sensibly neatly and\n[2051.4s] comfortably what\n[2056.6s] clad is the problem of the\n[2060.0s] diseases. Another thing here what are\n[2062.8s] the limbs? arms or what? Or legs of a\n[2066.2s] person or a four-legged animal. So when\n[2068.4s] I speak of the limbs, it is not\n[2072.9s] actually but\n[2074.9s] also the arms. Praise God. All of them\n[2078.5s] are what are limbs. So when inspiration\n[2080.7s] is saying that the limbs also should be\n[2083.7s] covered, then does it does it say that\n[2086.1s] we need to to cover both the arms and\n[2088.8s] the feet? That is what it means.\n[2092.3s] It is\n[2093.6s] inappropriate. Uhhuh. Uh it says the\n[2097.6s] limbs were not formed. That is 2T page\n[2099.8s] 531 paragraph 3. The limbs were not\n[2102.2s] formed by our creator to endure exposure\n[2105.1s] as was the what? As was the face. They\n[2108.6s] were not created to endure the same\n[2110.1s] cold, to endure the same heat. It is\n[2112.9s] only face protective to endure all those\n[2116.2s] climates. But when it comes to the\n[2118.1s] limbs, it was not it was not so. So when\n[2121.3s] our limbs are facing the same\n[2123.1s] environment, we are allowing them to\n[2125.2s] face the same heat as is the what is the\n[2129.3s] is the face then there is a problem.\n[2131.4s] Another evil which are the feet another\n[2134.0s] line there the feet and limbs being\n[2136.0s] removed from the vital organs should be\n[2138.2s] especially guarded from cold by abundant\n[2140.6s] wash\n[2143.6s] clothing. So from this do you\n[2147.7s] think short sleeve? What do you think of\n[2149.9s] short sleeve\n[2154.0s] shirt? What do you think of short sleeve\n[2156.4s] shirt? Sat shirt. What do you think of\n[2160.1s] it? Praise\n[2162.0s] God. What do you think of\n[2164.5s] it? Is it dangerous to the\n[2167.9s] health? Is\n[2169.9s] it? Yes.\n[2172.1s] Because the the limbs in no matter by\n[2177.0s] the way sometimes when you go to these\n[2179.3s] these\n[2182.4s] places a lot\n[2184.6s] of\n[2199.5s] heatffected but the sometimes remains to\n[2202.2s] be no to be normal and that is very\n[2204.6s] dangerous in it is impossible to have\n[2207.1s] health when the extremities are habitual\n[2209.2s] what cooled for if there is too little\n[2211.9s] blood in them there will be too much in\n[2214.0s] the portions of the body and by the\n[2216.5s] way headache not because there is of\n[2220.2s] anything but because you've you've worn\n[2222.6s] a a short\n[2223.9s] sleeve shirt because once your arms are\n[2228.4s] cold the blood is not going to be\n[2230.9s] supplied there\n[2232.1s] efficiently meaning that other parts of\n[2234.2s] the body are going to have excess blood\n[2236.5s] like the brain and that is what will be\n[2238.6s] causing\n[2240.0s] headache. Praise God. Now it says\n[2243.6s] perfect health requires a perfect what\n[2246.4s] but perfect circulation but this cannot\n[2250.8s] be while there while three or four times\n[2254.9s] as much clothing is worn upon the body\n[2257.1s] as upon the feet\n[2259.4s] and my\n[2264.5s] friend is\n[2266.2s] it so\n[2269.1s] shortle in my chest and everything I've\n[2271.5s] covered them But my limbs\n[2274.0s] are they are free. Elen is saying you\n[2277.1s] cannot have a perfect health because\n[2279.0s] there is no way you can have three or\n[2280.5s] four times as much clothing worn upon\n[2282.9s] the body as upon the what the feet and\n[2286.0s] and limbs. So when you read down\n[2288.0s] the all of them we should give a equal\n[2292.4s] distribution of heat in the in the body.\n[2295.7s] Now let me give you another one here.\n[2297.4s] The limbs and feet have large veins to\n[2300.2s] receive large amount of blood that\n[2302.8s] warmth,\n[2304.4s] nutrition, elasticity and strength may\n[2307.9s] be imparted to them. But when the blood\n[2310.7s] is chilled from these extremities, the\n[2313.2s] blood vessels contract which makes the\n[2315.5s] circulation of the necessary amount of\n[2317.0s] blood in them still more what?\n[2319.8s] Difficult. So we need to give body\n[2321.9s] actually easy time because when you\n[2323.8s] don't give them easy time there is a\n[2325.8s] problem.\n[2327.4s] And we will be going to simply because\n[2330.0s] of adaption or regular wearing of the\n[2333.4s] long sleeved what charts. I want to read\n[2336.2s] something\n[2336.9s] here.\n[2340.1s] Mhm. I want to give you something\n[2350.9s] here. Uh-huh. The\n[2354.0s] limbs. Our\n[2358.1s] creator.\n[2360.8s] Uh-huh.\n[2363.6s] Uh-huh. Just read. Our creator has\n[2369.8s] formed. Our creator has formed the limbs\n[2372.3s] with large veins and vessels to contain\n[2374.8s] a large proportion of blood that the\n[2378.6s] limbs may be\n[2380.1s] sufficiently nourished and\n[2382.3s] proportionately warmed with the other\n[2384.1s] portions of the what? There must be\n[2386.5s] equal distribution of heat in the bowl.\n[2388.9s] But\n[2389.8s] what robs the limbs of the\n[2392.8s] coverings and the life current is\n[2395.9s] chilled from its natural channel and\n[2398.4s] thrown back upon its internal what? So\n[2401.6s] what is depriving the limbs of what it\n[2403.6s] requires\n[2407.2s] passion there's a there is something I\n[2409.6s] want to read for you so that you see all\n[2412.5s] these things in a clear light.\n[2416.4s] fashion child guidance for 27 paragraph\n[2420.5s] one so that you see who brought these\n[2423.2s] things we have sleeveless I didn't\n[2424.6s] capture the photos here\n[2427.2s] sleeveless cut book\n[2440.4s] tople trousers short skirts\n[2444.5s] All of those they are doing what?\n[2446.2s] They're exposing our what? Our limbs.\n[2449.2s] And we've said limbs concern the arms\n[2451.3s] and the what? And the legs. Now read\n[2453.4s] this quotation 427 paragraph one the\n[2455.8s] book of what? Child guidance. It says\n[2458.4s] Satan invented the fashions which leave\n[2462.0s] the limbs exposed.\n[2465.7s] may invent\n[2467.5s] sleeveless may\n[2471.8s] [Music]\n[2473.3s] invents.\n[2475.1s] Yes, by the\n[2478.8s] way, the problem\n[2485.6s] is do you think the arms are suffering?\n[2488.8s] According to what we've read from the\n[2490.1s] inspired word, they are suffering. So it\n[2492.6s] says Satan invented the fashions which\n[2495.1s] leave the limbs exposed chilling back\n[2497.8s] the life current from its original\n[2499.8s] course and parents bow at the shrine of\n[2503.3s] fashion to uh and so clothe their\n[2506.2s] children that the nerves and veins\n[2508.6s] become contracted and do not answer the\n[2511.6s] purpose that God designed they should.\n[2514.3s] The result is habitually called feet and\n[2517.3s] what hands. Those parents whose follow\n[2521.4s] fashions instead of reason will have an\n[2523.8s] account to render to God for thus\n[2526.2s] robbing their children of health. This\n[2529.3s] is parents being addressed. Do you know\n[2531.5s] you'll have an account to render before\n[2533.6s] God? By the way, most of the\n[2553.2s] children and you know the Bible says\n[2555.1s] that we need to teach our little\n[2556.6s] children that God is not happy when\n[2558.8s] seeing them in torn and filthy\n[2561.1s] garments. Do you know that?\n[2564.2s] And you know that the truth cannot place\n[2566.5s] its delicate feet in the filthy\n[2568.8s] environment. Praise God. So how will you\n[2571.9s] convince this child up that he need to\n[2573.9s] be neat? When he was young, you allowed\n[2576.2s] him to roam around with torn\n[2579.6s] garments and everything. Praise God.\n[2582.5s] Very\n[2583.2s] dangerous. So it says that parents, my\n[2585.8s] friends, will have to give an account\n[2588.0s] when you allow your children to roam\n[2589.5s] around with what? with short-sleeved\n[2593.4s] clothes. You don't cover their limbs\n[2595.2s] well and they suffer diseases. You take\n[2597.5s] them to hospital, they are dragged to\n[2599.1s] death and some are laid under grave\n[2601.9s] because of improper what? Immodesty\n[2606.1s] dress. So we need to change and even for\n[2609.3s] us for our ministers when you go to to\n[2611.6s] buy a shirt from the inspiration you\n[2614.0s] need actually to embrace the long\n[2615.6s] sleeved what? Because it will be the one\n[2618.1s] that will be complying to what is\n[2619.5s] written.\n[2620.9s] I want to show you something\n[2622.9s] here. How do we clothe our bodies to\n[2625.8s] maintain this proper what? Circulation.\n[2628.2s] The limbs which should have even more\n[2630.3s] covering than any other portion of the\n[2634.4s] what? Because of their farthest from the\n[2638.8s] center of the circulation are often not\n[2641.5s] suitably protected while over the vital\n[2644.7s] organs. Uhhuh. It says while over the\n[2647.5s] vital organs where there is naturally\n[2650.0s] more warmth than in any other portion of\n[2652.4s] the body there is an undue proportion of\n[2655.1s] what of covering from from the pain of\n[2657.7s] inspiration we need to give burden upon\n[2661.2s] clothing\n[2662.4s] our limbs because they are far from\n[2666.2s] heart and for them to maintain a proper\n[2669.1s] circulation of the blood they need to be\n[2671.1s] held by proper cover. Are we going back\n[2674.7s] to the fig leaves or are we embracing\n[2677.5s] the uh uh the the what the coats of skin\n[2680.6s] that God clothed with Adam and Eve? That\n[2683.4s] is the question I want you to read here.\n[2686.4s] We must cover our limbs be it summer or\n[2690.0s] what at all\n[2693.2s] seasons bear arms and bear arms and leg.\n[2697.4s] We think we think this mode of dressing\n[2700.4s] must be recorded as one of the most\n[2702.6s] prominent causes of uh prominent causes\n[2706.6s] of summer compliance. In colder weather,\n[2710.3s] congestion and inflammation of the\n[2712.2s] lungs, congestion and inflammations of\n[2714.3s] the brain, convulsions etc will result\n[2718.2s] at all seasons. Congestion more or less\n[2721.6s] is what is caused simply because of what\n[2724.3s] is called uncovering of the limbs. I\n[2726.3s] want to show you something here called\n[2728.3s] the next list after this where I'm going\n[2730.5s] to list the diseases that comes as a\n[2732.3s] result that we are not closing our\n[2734.4s] covering our limbs. So it says special\n[2738.4s] attention special attention should be\n[2740.7s] given to the extremities that they may\n[2744.2s] be thoroughly they may be as thoroughly\n[2747.2s] do you know what is\n[2748.4s] thorough they may be as thoroughly\n[2751.0s] clothed as the chest and the region over\n[2753.2s] the what over the heart where the\n[2757.3s] greatest amount of heat where is the\n[2759.7s] greatest amount of the heat in order to\n[2761.7s] equalize the circulation of the blood\n[2764.2s] the clothing should be equally\n[2766.5s] distributed upon the p upon the person\n[2769.0s] that that equal warmth may be preserved\n[2772.5s] in all parts of the what of the body.\n[2776.3s] Now health problems related to not\n[2778.6s] covering the arms and the limbs. The\n[2780.4s] list is long but I've just given these\n[2782.6s] ones for a start. Number one you have\n[2784.5s] short shortness of breath for those who\n[2788.0s] have experienced this. This is this is\n[2792.0s] true. Many people are suffering this\n[2794.4s] headaches, nose bleedings. You can just\n[2797.0s] be nos bleeding because of this problem.\n[2799.9s] The body is not is not heavenly\n[2803.8s] distributed. We have the fullness in\n[2806.1s] chest chest problem because of unequal\n[2810.5s] distribution of heat in the body because\n[2812.3s] we are not covering our limbs.\n[2813.9s] Palputation of the heart. Irritation and\n[2816.3s] restless heart failure. This thing my\n[2819.4s] friends in a letter had what is called\n[2821.8s] heart failure. Let me go back to\n[2824.4s] children. The lips of our children\n[2827.0s] should be done what?\n[2829.9s] Thoroughly and score that should be\n[2834.3s] thoroughly and\n[2836.1s] sensibly covered or clad. Parents who\n[2839.5s] dress their children with extremities\n[2842.1s] naked or nearly so are\n[2845.9s] sacrificing the health and the lives of\n[2848.5s] their children to\n[2858.6s] what? But you know that there is another\n[2861.0s] altar here that people are sacrificing\n[2863.6s] their children on. What is that altar?\n[2865.4s] the order of her of not covering the\n[2868.6s] limbs of the\n[2870.0s] children. Let me repeat this quotation.\n[2874.0s] Parents who parents who who dress their\n[2878.8s] children with the\n[2881.3s] extremities naked or merely so are\n[2884.9s] sacrificing the health and their lives.\n[2887.5s] Not just the health but also the what of\n[2890.2s] their children to the what? To the\n[2892.2s] fashion.\n[2893.8s] Children are killed. Which commandment\n[2896.0s] is that? Do not\n[2897.8s] kill. Six cind get what the parents are\n[2901.4s] doing? Children are killed by the manner\n[2904.6s] in which they are watched. So when you\n[2907.0s] have your siblings here, you need to\n[2909.4s] take notes of this because many children\n[2912.1s] are killed by the parents and by their\n[2913.7s] siblings in which in the manner of which\n[2916.6s] they what they are dressed left with\n[2919.0s] bare arms and legs and with low naked\n[2921.8s] what?\n[2924.0s] dresses. It is a sin in the sight of\n[2927.4s] heaven for parents to dress their\n[2929.4s] children as the way they\n[2936.4s] do. It is a sin before in the sight of\n[2940.9s] heaven for parents to dress their\n[2943.0s] children the way they are doing.\n[2945.9s] Judgment shall run or shall rest upon\n[2948.7s] the what? Upon the parents. How many are\n[2951.2s] seeing that we need actually we need a\n[2952.8s] reformation on this issue?\n[2956.6s] May God help us because when God is not\n[2959.6s] going to help us on this many of our\n[2962.2s] children are going to be laid on grave\n[2964.2s] because of very simple\n[2967.5s] issues other related problems in\n[2971.2s] digestion not because\n[2974.0s] of but because of improper\n[2978.2s] what you're not covering the extremities\n[2981.0s] in a letter by the\n[2983.6s] way praise\n[2994.7s] Extraring constipating nerves and veins\n[2998.0s] become contracted causing bad\n[3000.2s] circulation. And by the way, this list\n[3001.8s] comprises also when you're on a bad\n[3003.8s] tight tight tight skin tight tight. Now\n[3008.6s] it\n[3009.3s] says uhhuh edma congestion of the lungs\n[3013.6s] and everything. You can screenshot that\n[3015.9s] it is online. I don't know our\n[3018.4s] technician is not around. I don't know\n[3020.1s] how we are helping those people online.\n[3022.0s] Uhhuh. And many other more. Now I read\n[3026.6s] this that who is the inventor of the\n[3028.9s] sleeveless? Who is the inventor of the\n[3031.0s] short sleeves? Who is the inventor of\n[3033.6s] shorts? Who is the inventor of short\n[3035.8s] skirts? Satan invents the version which\n[3038.4s] leaves the limbs what? Exposed. It is\n[3041.9s] Satan's design so to pervert every\n[3044.4s] function of our being that life may be\n[3046.7s] made miserable and God may be dishonored\n[3049.9s] in the creation in the creatures he had\n[3052.4s] he had created. Satan plans and pre\n[3057.0s] premeditates ways that we can be made\n[3060.6s] miserable. Satan kill a kill a time kill\n[3064.2s] a time in how can I make the health of\n[3067.4s] these people\n[3075.2s] miserable very\n[3082.1s] small praise God because he wants your\n[3085.1s] health to be\n[3087.6s] deteriorated because he knows that when\n[3089.8s] your health is infled You cannot give\n[3092.2s] God the perfect the perfect service that\n[3094.8s] you ought to have given him. It is a\n[3096.8s] solemn statement\n[3098.4s] beloved on one a one that should take us\n[3103.0s] to our knees. It is a it is a solemn\n[3105.9s] statement one that should take us to our\n[3108.6s] knees possibly before our wardrobe and\n[3111.8s] make some decisions. Do you know that\n[3114.8s] after this two weeks we need when we go\n[3118.0s] back home we need to go back to our what\n[3120.8s] our wardrobe. Do you know what is a\n[3122.8s] wardrobe? Do you know that the some of\n[3125.0s] us came with with clothes that we need\n[3127.0s] to go back to our wardrobes and make a\n[3128.8s] decision? It says certain plans and pre\n[3133.0s] pre what meditates ways that we can be\n[3136.6s] made miserable. How many are miserable\n[3139.6s] because they are not dressing properly?\n[3141.8s] How many? millions. It is a solemn\n[3145.2s] statement,\n[3146.7s] one that should take us to our knees. It\n[3150.2s] is a solemn statement that should take\n[3151.9s] us to our knees possibly be uh before\n[3155.4s] our wardrobes and make what? Some\n[3165.0s] decisions. Praise God.\n[3171.0s] Charity. Which\n[3174.0s] charity? Which charity is\n[3179.6s] that? Is it charity? Is it a charitable\n[3183.3s] work? What is the solution for\n[3187.2s] that? If medical books are banned, what\n[3189.8s] of\n[3190.7s] dress? They need to\n[3194.4s] be another thing. Because my friends\n[3198.1s] there are some by the way you can modify\n[3199.6s] so\n[3200.5s] that and by the way you have some short\n[3202.8s] sleeves maybe I don't say because we\n[3206.1s] have this these are\n[3208.6s] small you can put that short sleeve\n[3210.8s] inside inside it is presentable for that\n[3213.8s] praise God and it will help you to to\n[3216.5s] distribute it heavenly\n[3220.4s] now dress from reason and what don't\n[3225.2s] just dress because don't just dress.\n[3228.6s] Sometimes you need even to pray before\n[3229.8s] you dress. It is manifest that most\n[3232.8s] women do not think and act in reverence\n[3235.0s] to dress from reason and\n[3238.6s] reflect. They accept without questioning\n[3241.8s] that which imposes upon what? Upon\n[3247.5s] them. You are not dressing out of reason\n[3250.3s] and reflection. You need to dress out of\n[3252.8s] reason and what? Reflection. Another\n[3255.0s] point in the preparation of the\n[3257.5s] clothing, can you actually seek God's\n[3260.2s] blessings on\n[3261.9s] that? Do you think you can do\n[3267.1s] that? May you bless\n[3270.8s] this that God thank you for how many are\n[3274.6s] always\n[3276.7s] praying. Praise\n[3278.7s] God. How many always\n[3282.0s] pray? Let me connect this with the first\n[3284.4s] angel's message. And I I saw another\n[3287.5s] angel that is Revelation 14:6. And I saw\n[3290.7s] another angel flying in the midst of\n[3292.9s] what? Having the everlasting gospel to\n[3295.5s] preach unto them that dwell on the on\n[3297.6s] the what? And\n[3301.6s] to and to every nation\n[3305.3s] kindred and and he said with what? with\n[3309.9s] a loud voice that we need to do what? We\n[3313.0s] need to fear God. Number one to\n[3315.9s] fear and give glory. Why? For the hour\n[3320.5s] of his judgment is what? Did you see the\n[3323.1s] guy showed you is the hour of judgment\n[3325.4s] is\n[3326.4s] coming? Yes. What should we do? We\n[3329.4s] should we need to fear God and give\n[3332.4s] glory. And what does the book of 1\n[3334.7s] Corinthians chapter\n[3336.1s] 10:31, what does it say?\n[3342.0s] Uh-huh.\n[3344.0s] Whatsoever.\n[3346.4s] Uh-huh. Let me read it. Says, \"Wherefore\n[3351.0s] whatsoever you eat or drink or\n[3353.8s] whatsoever you do, do all to the glory\n[3356.6s] of who?\" Of God. So, by the way, is\n[3361.2s] dressing something we\n[3362.8s] do? Yes. Now when we are dressing we\n[3366.2s] need to do it to the glory of and that\n[3369.3s] is why when we are dressing up we need\n[3371.5s] even to give we need to pray over it so\n[3373.9s] that our dressing be of good influence\n[3376.8s] upon nonbelievers and also upon the\n[3379.9s] believers. We need to ask God is my\n[3382.4s] dress giving glory and honor to you\n[3385.2s] because when it is not doing that then\n[3387.1s] it is contrary to the spirit of the\n[3388.6s] gospel.\n[3390.2s] To bring this to a close, it says when\n[3393.3s] they really desire, I would ask, let me\n[3397.1s] start in the preparation of their\n[3398.8s] clothing, can they seek the Lord's\n[3401.0s] blessing? I would ask of today who\n[3404.3s] profess to believe present truth when\n[3406.6s] they really desire an article of dress\n[3409.0s] or some of convenience. Do they lay the\n[3412.5s] matter before the Lord in prayer?\n[3420.2s] Do you present that\n[3422.0s] before that when you\n[3425.7s] go\n[3428.0s] sanctioned to know if his spirit will\n[3431.1s] sanction\n[3432.7s] that now\n[3434.8s] beloved we need actually to make a\n[3437.8s] change because when you don't make a\n[3439.7s] change in this there is a great issue\n[3441.9s] that is awaiting us and God is calling\n[3444.2s] upon his children and when God is\n[3446.6s] calling upon on his children. It is very\n[3449.0s] serious. It is something that is worth\n[3453.6s] consideration. It is worth consideration\n[3456.2s] and I'll not talk of\n[3457.7s] that.\n[3459.4s] Women are always what are too often\n[3464.0s] tempters. They are too often tempters.\n[3467.7s] If women would only elevate their lives,\n[3470.0s] they will be less danger through their\n[3471.6s] what? Through their influence. Do you\n[3475.0s] know that there are many people who are\n[3477.2s] in the nin they are in the they're in\n[3480.5s] the prisons because of how someone\n[3482.0s] dressed somewhere. Do you know\n[3485.0s] that they're in prisons because of how\n[3488.5s] someone dressed somewhere and he was\n[3490.5s] tempted and he\n[3492.1s] raped today is in prison maybe for 30\n[3496.0s] years because someone who professed to\n[3498.6s] be a seventh day Adventist somewhere\n[3501.4s] somewhere and I wish that God may help\n[3503.8s] us. We need to be daughters of Zion and\n[3507.7s] we need not the daughters of God of\n[3510.1s] Babylon. And it is time to change you.\n[3513.4s] What was what was what was our\n[3516.0s] topic? The Christian modesty. What was\n[3519.4s] the subtopic? Dress, fashion, and what?\n[3523.8s] And health. How many have understood\n[3527.1s] something? May God bless us in Jesus\n[3529.7s] name. Allow me to\n[3536.7s] pray.\n[3540.2s] Our heavenly father in\n[3543.1s] heaven, we thank you because of your\n[3545.5s] love that you have given\n[3547.2s] us. I thank you because of the message\n[3550.2s] of\n[3551.1s] dress which is an index to our heart.\n[3555.4s] May you help your\n[3556.9s] children to be convicted upon their\n[3560.5s] thoughts to make a sound decision that\n[3563.1s] shall glorify your name. Forgive us of\n[3566.1s] our past ignorances and where we had\n[3568.9s] messed up and multiply us grace to\n[3572.4s] ensure that we comply to your will which\n[3576.1s] is the demands of heaven. Be with us I\n[3578.8s] pray in Jesus holy\n[3581.2s] name. Thank you. I to give uh uh some"

into your words to bring clarity to the controversies all around us blessed us for these few moments grant us Heavenly I Salve that we may discern truth that we may also identify error under any guise bless us now we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen I want to turn your attention to Luke Chapter 12. let's turn there Luke chapter 12. how many of you are anxious for tomorrow's service beginning of this final seven days on Earth experience seven Sanctuary feasts are you ready for it friends I'm ready by God's grace now this evening as we spend a few moments addressing these controversies I'm going to ask you kindly to get a writing instrument notepads and the questions that come to your mind as we go throughout this by God's grace at the end I will accommodate those questions I'm going to get my iPad by God's grace and those of you online can also tune in and send in your questions let's turn quickly to Luke chapter 12 and today we're going to continue from where we left off on this morning I was blessed this morning how about you were those points clear as we looked at the sanctuary you see friends everything that we profess to believe as Seventh-day Adventist we believe we can prove those truths from the Bible from the sanctuary am I right yes so what about the logo the actual brand of this church should we be able to prove that also from the sanctuary yes and that's why we are addressing this all-important subject that's not what God plays on his Tabernacle is that what he put dear friends some individuals have taken this logo and actually stated that apparent cross is actually inverted and inverted crosses are connected to witchcraft just follow the top end of that so-called cross when God speaks does he speak plainly and the churches with this and these logos on them if those Tabernacles were in the time of Moses and God inspired a sinner to bring his lamb what Christ have led that sinner to these Tabernacles why wrong address wrong address wrong symbol wrong address they call these three lines Three Angels they call that cherubims that is a disgrace to God there it is friends ecumenical ecumenical straight from Babylon now what if here at safe to serve one day you walked into the church and I had two logos in the front two logos in the center two logos on the walls The Three Angels on one side and the flickering Flame over a so-called book and a cross on the other side what would you think what would you think talk to me what what would come to your mind but I said you do not know what would have come to my mind you don't want to hear it what what would come to your mind if I lost my mind am I insane have I stepped off the platform what else am I confused do you know you have churches out there that claim to believe in present truth claim to be preaching the sermons and the messages for the hour and they have two logos why why would they have two logos The Three Angels on one side or maybe on a website that they oversee but at the actual church building they have that the flickering Flame from Babylon why would they do that what now double-minded want to please everybody that's called compromise one is of god Bible one is of Babylon of Satan that's compromise what would Elijah say if God be God serve him but if bail serve him how long hold you between two opinions not six friends that's called compromise that's called hypocrisy why because if you connect yourself with this organization they want to make sure you have that logo no there's several things I want to say here how many of you remember those days you went to some Churches especially if you are second third fourth generation SDA do you remember uh pardon me not that uh do you remember this logo here or even a rendition of it on the buildings the glass thin windows uh maybe I I took it out that the true logo right there in the center the true logo on the glass stand windows some Churches still had the logo there do you know why they have they have not gotten around to it yet to remodel it but soon they will and others may still have the logo but the message has changed the experience has changed am I right or wrong you know I'm speaking the truth as God lives and as you think about it as they have removed the logo they've also removed the message let's take a look at the first angel what says that first cherubim of chapter 14 of the Revelation verse 7 fear God right say it with me fear God give glory to him why the our office judgment is calm and worship him who made Heaven Earth sea and The Fountains of waters what's number one fear God what does it mean to fear God fear God fear God Victor overseen to despise and hate evil Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 13 the fear of the Lord is to hate evil Pride arrogancy how do we know they have changed the message are they not preaching we will never get victory over sin we'll be sinning until Christ comes what does that mean not only has the logo change but what the message has changed then comes give Glory what does that mean to give Glory Health reform dress reform tempering they are thrown out Health reform just reform Temperance what about judgment they've rejected October 22nd 1844. what about worship God on the seventh day Sabbath have you not heard do you not remember the actual cry that we want to hold Sabbath surfaces on Sunday mornings for those who have to work on Sabbath and cannot come to church on God's Sabbath day Sabbath you can come on Sunday mornings and our church why the logo has changed the merchandise has also changed that's it it would it would be weird as I said bizarre as I said this morning you walk into a Bed Bath and Beyond store and you see no what do they sell inside there so clothing they sell soap okay bath soap right okay and what else Etc you walk inside there and what are they selling watermelon cantaloupe come on now it's it's it's it's it's fall season okay broccoli collards right you would say where am I the sign is correct but the merchandise is incorrect or they don't have the sign and don't have the message Luke chapter 12 go to verse 1. it says be weary after laughing of whom the Pharisees which is what friends hypocrisy hypocrisy and that's why this morning I spent time on this this is God's true sign past that won't spend time on this okay everybody read the red words with me I was told that men will employ every policy to make less prominent the difference between the faith our Seventh-Day Adventists and those who observe the first day of the week past that all right friends okay now notice again they will say we must remove the banner or sign the banner or sign and what sign that God put on his building what sign is on new Jerusalem's Tabernacle the Angels at the gates on the Tabernacle gate and Tabernacle past that won't spend time on that okay I saw some reaching out their hands to remove the banner and to obscure fix that and to obscure its significance I don't want to keep you here too long all right let's move on from this we cannot know and what they want to say friends those who are standing faithful to God in observing the true message and the true logo that they are the ones who have started a new organization now I I wish I had something here on what side of the four corners or four sides of the sanctuary it was the good place on what side East Side so they traveled from where East to where West so what what direction did the Angels cherubims fly east to west from the gate to where the door of the Tabernacle holy Place inner Veil and then most holy is traveling we're east to west and that's why by God's grace we turn our logo with the angels with trumpets not going right to left but what not going left to right but what right to left East to West so when someone sees safe to serve's logo they'll ask a question why are your angels flying right to left what will you say let's go to the sanctuary these cherubims fly how right to left East to West will you say Amen friends we have to make sure we come as close to scripture as possible it's a sign what if someone says come meet me here and remove you remember we were going to evangelize and evangelist John Ryan sent me this uh the direction and instead of putting let's say other member of the address instead of putting uh John's Road he put John's Avenue well here we have John 1 and John's Avenue I'm looking for John's Avenue when it should be John's Road but John is correct but what's incorrect Avenue or road is it important now which direction you're flying or brothers and sisters is it important all right let's move on from that there it is friends you know what let's turn the first Timothy chapter three go there with me and First Timothy chapter three and verse number 16 God's word says uh without controversy great is the mystery of godliness greatest watch Friends the mystery of godliness and there is a controversy going on right now and that controversy is stay in the SDA churches versus come out of apostasy is that clear friends and those who give the latter cry come out of apostasy those in the former group who say you're calling people out of the SDA Church that's what they say that's hypocrisy that's not correct they are creating what we call a straw man because Andrew Enriquez yours truly have never said come out of SDA churches you have ordered me what have I always say come out of what a past State local SDA churches as well as come out of a prostate non-conference churches it goes both ways but when they preach and teach they're calling you to church organization volume 4 page two go to Isaiah chapter one where are you going to my friends Isaiah chapter one what makes our Seventh-day Adventist one more time red words notice how sister white quoted in the blue words the Three Angels messages of course she mentioned first and second that's present truth then she said a red word those who pass through these experiences are to be as firm as a rock to the principles that have made us what everybody Seventh Day Adventist volume what's that volume nine testimonies for the church volume 9 page 48 says let ministers and people bear in mind there may affect that their names are registered on the church's books will not save them oh but I thought if your name is not on a local conference SDA Church you're not going to be saved that was volume nine what page I gave you page 48 pass this won't spend time on that I covered that this morning we cannot now enter into any new Organization for this would mean a pass to see from the word everybody apostasy from the truth now watch this watch Carefree that is the the direction foreign come to me which which slideshow is this it looks weird it looks strange preacher let's see now does this day evening that was from you evangelist Ryan all right let's go to John chapter 15 why do you get that straight preacher preacher that's what I was looking for which direction are the Angels flying we're going to talk afterwards amen preacher come now let's reason and now I use the rod and the staff to comfort you amen they're flying away right to left East to West that's it yeah amen I'm like what's going on here amen all right let's pass this let's let's move past this friend let's go to where we're going now all right east to west amen amen all right watch this now beloved this is uh who is he by the way who is he of where down the show 10 of Three Angels Broadcast Network 3abn several days ago he did a presentation entitled if not now then when how should God's Church deal with homo and what else my friends infanticide and feet decide now notice Danny shoten lay down my he was protesting he was crying aloud he was spearing not no I didn't watch the video all of it I just saw the first portion I want to share with you a clip right here and I want you to tell me what you think about this clip in light off what has transpired with the logo controversy either from the world or should we be using the logo from the Bible no question does anybody know when they voted to change our logo hmm I was in New York City somewhere in 97 98 I'm not sure if my mother recalls that and a letter came to the home from the conference and we saw a small uh five by seven uh pamphlet and in it was described the changing of the logo now who who recalls the date when they voted to change the logo anybody so who changed it who gave them the authority to do so who voted and what reasons did they give to change it what Bible what Spirit of Prophecy and if I'm going to change something you know what they say if it's not broken come on finish it yeah so what's wrong with the Three Angels why do you want to change it who asked those pertinent questions by the way if you're alive and you had the answers just send in that comment there email me let's talk about it friends back to this preacher here Mr protester hear what he said in light of the logo listen so today for those who think I'm paranoid now I'm gonna get into some really heavy stuff right now for those of you who think I'm paranoid or just homophobic let me first give you a few real life examples of deceptions affecting the leadership even in this church I love this church I love this church I never intend to to leave this church right that's not my intentions if if if they start teaching things as a church as a body if we start teaching things it's not biblical I'm going to leave I'm leaving because my loyalty is to God where's your loyalty he's leaving where's he going look at what is situated on the bottom right of the screen what is that a logo what is that how many of you recall the first three ABN logo was that it come on what's that it was that it what is that imagine God saying sinner come to this Tabernacle with cherubims and he walks up and you see three lines where is the sign so he may need to pack his bags right but where is he going and the Very sins he's protesting against in Loma Linda elsewhere have been supported by leadership in the general conference why do I say that the mere fact that there are moaned and silent on the point it means that they're complicit with the same apostasis am I clear all the points playing let's pray for The Elder here let's move on my friends watch this this is a controversial statement that has been floating around seventh day adventism and normally in Sabbath afternoons this time around after evangelism we will go into question and answer question and answer so this question was posed was posed this statement is found on the white eg1 estate of egy writings all right friends now this red box two small paragraphs I'm gonna magnify those two paragraphs okay it was written in 1901 September 24th okay and many use this statement to say it doesn't matter what's happening in the church stay in the churches now watch there's no qualification given so if there's apostasy in that local church stay right there say right there supported supported we I don't teach that wherever apostasy is among leadership after you pray with after you consult with if they continue to promote and teach them the heresy you should not stay there based on the Bible and the spirit of Prophecy you should not find somewhere else and go you should not because by beholding you become one changed and once you stay there and support it you strengthen the apostates I'm not speaking about the pews leadership I'm talking about all right so we are going to be addressing this statement here watch carefully so friends here it is let not the professed people of God think it's a privilege to separate from conference organization that they may show their supposed efficiency and I think our sisters here who also asked this question several weeks ago red words this is entirely opposed to God's word this is what friends no no please talk back to me so I'm so I'm clear that you're following the bouncing ball this is entirely opposed to God's order what is entirely opposed to God's order to separate from what conference organization let's read on there is need of perfect unity and love and this will appear when we learn of Jesus it is the plan of God that every church and every conference shall cherish the feeling of reciprocal dependence what friends depending on each other or I depend on you you depend on me reciprocal okay let me ask you a question if I say to you that this statement in 1901 shouldn't you get every other statement in sister-watch writings about Ministries comma churches comma publishing houses comma medical missionary institutions comma not being under schools comma not being under the conference would you say Amen to that that one statement Must Destroy every other who with intelligence would reason like that you take one statement that says it's not in God's order to separate from the conference organization use that to destroy every other statement that says the opposite and say look when you read those are the statements they must be understood based on this one how could that be that's the same argument the Sunday people use to justify Sunday what year is that written in 1901 right September look at the statement here what year is this at the bottom 1907 to whom their sister went right Elder Daniels was actually the general conference president watch this statement when my advice was asked in reference to the Madison School the watch School now when you hear school you're thinking uh classroom setting theater style uh a lectern and teacher the Madison School means an Enterprise right setting up training centers and raising up schools churches medical missionary sites and Publishing houses watch this by the way let's go there because I put it in your mind listen located 10 miles Northeast of Nashville Madison was an important spot in early Southern Seventh-Day adventism the Madison property often referred to as a medicine farm so you have management School management Farm was purchased in what year 1904 with the financial assistance of Nelly uh Gillard and the prophetic vision of Ellen White it says spearheaded by EA Sutherland Percy Megan the medicine contingent contingent now would spawn a collection of what schools hospitals Industries and what churches around the South so what were they establishing all right watch careful now let's go right here I'll come back to that watch us now friends it says when my advice was asked in reference to the Madison School I said remain as you are there is danger in binding every working agency everyone Elder Buchanan I mean should I go there now you say no are you my conscience preacher listen I agree with you there is a danger in binding every working agency under the what friends the dictation of the conference the Lord did not design that this should be so friends which statement was inspired the 1901 or 1907 which one which one was inspired which one both were inspired so why the difference circumstances what's the difference circumstances now here is a counter argument to this statement here on the screen some would say well that's true that's how medicine began not with the conference but later on in years right later on maybe a decade after or so some of the various institutions they established came back under the conference so that means you must negate this instruction here who is in that way because circumstances changed does not destroy the council that was given have ever read in the Bible the Lord repented have you why would God repent that would be a good Bible question so let me not give too much on that okay but why did God repent because circumstances changed so he promised destruction right and what happened it was coming but they were they repented so God withheld it God repented oh that's the answer right dear friends can God sin so repent it doesn't mean to sin and repent and to convert amen so God changed because circumstances change he withheld destruction one example Nineveh minivan amen it's clear God withheld destruction let's continue it says the Lord did not design that this should be what are the next two words in blue the circumstances were such the burden-bearers in the Madison School could not bind up their work with the conference I knew their situation and when many of the leading men in our conferences ignore them because they did not Place their school under the the conference dictation I was shown that they would not be helped by making themselves amenable to what the conference they had better remain as led by God amenable to him to work out his plans but this matter need not be blazed abroad so friends what if the circumstances that were Rife and prevalent in this time 1907 when the instruction was given what if they are prevalent today would it be okay then to follow the same instructions or do you not believe in inspiration is inspiration it was given because of circle says are they alive in the world today so how could you negate the statement and because they can they say well later on some of those churches were brought under the conference does that negate the instruction sometimes men reason as if they are infants and it's either they are ignorant listen attentively either they are ignorant or they lack comprehension skills they lack intelligence or they have a Sinister agenda I wonder what it is which one let's move on Modern paragraph it says means have been held from them Madison because in the organization and management of the Madison School it was not placed under the control of the conference but the reason why this school wasn't owned and controlled by the conference have not been duly considered move on then she said watch carefully friends how much of this I want to give you watch carefully you want all of it some with all of it red words Huntsville first sentence Alabama Madison listen in the matter of the Madison School there has been a standing off from them because they were not under the ownership and control of some conference all right it says this is a question thou should sometimes be considered but it is not the Lord's plan that means should be withheld from medicine because they were what I want to ask you a question what antithesis do we hear to that statement every tithe every offering must go weird huh so you hear one thing but read something else Luke 12 verse 1 Beware of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees the leaven of the leaders hypocrisy that's what it says right there that means means can go to where institutions not connected to the conference let's read on the attitude with some of our Brethren have assumed toward this Enterprise shows it is not wise for every every working agency to be under the dictation of conference officers there are Harmony they're all is that what sister white wrote they're all no there are some Enterprises on the one certain conditions that will produce better results if one standing alone that's abc123 is that clear friends now that's why you you would never hear yours truly say every church is in apostasy or everybody come what I'm simply calling people out of War apostasy wherever it is conference lines or self-supporting lines now do we have to wait second do we have to wait to see apostasy and use that as the reason to stand alone no no no you don't have to give me a Biblical example of that where somebody didn't work with the conference the sanhegan council but yet stood alone in Ministry John the Baptist who was he by the way before I get to Christ who was he by the way John the Baptist whose son was he Zacharias who was Zacharias high priest so in the natural order of things what and who what office should John the Baptist have assumed high priest priesthood but what happened God didn't call him to become a high priest a pastor an elder in the Sanhedrin Conference of synagogues he had a self-supporting and independent Ministry of the conference song Enterprises can stand alone I'm going to say this many of these men they frame their talking points as if there's only one side that has an issue as if you folks over here who are self-supporting you despise the brethren in the conference and separate yourself you will never hear them look on the other angle and say those men in the conference don't want to hear truth hypocrisy and they in the conference will never invite some men to come and preach in their pulpits it's always one perspective Sinister agenda when you can be balanced you can be bought and sold you're a Slave let's move on from that I told you you're going to get it what year is this at the bottom what year what year do you remember hold on because everything I say I must give you receipts receipts you remember a man whose name is he's alive Bill not and he wrote an article says time to marginalize he says it's time to ostracize men like dog Bachelor anyone who preaches against women's ordination should not be brought into SDA pulpits what is that separation right let's come here what year is this on the screen friends 1903 okay notice now this is Ellen White and she's speaking of her son Edson white that's the first two sentences blue words just a white rights he it's in white her son will be accounted out of what out of line but many ought to be out of the lines that have been maintained to be the regular routine how many no some few many and unless they themselves the conference line come into line they will say we are God's Church so the conference Brethren will say we are God's Temple we are God's Church sister white says unless that Temple is purified cleansed and Sanctified God would not give them his presence in the temple of which they boast those who would have rejoiced to see something done were all determined to give one no recognition to whom it's in white as a person or the one his work why because he did not work in the break what is a regular lines the conference what year is that but they caught 1901. now which one which one came after 1901 oh friends listen God has presented before you how he regarded the regular lines it says it needs to be broken as a word a partridge vessel is broken and what reconstructed how could you say 1901 Must Destroy this statement put this reference down in great controversy 371 sister white rights she says not one statement should be used not once saying of Christ let's fix it properly not one thing of Christ should be used to destroy another you can't do that friends they're all inspired let's let's move on now look at this statement here what year is that at the bottom 1907 where was Sister white in 1907 or even before 1907 where was she because I mean that was when it was written where was she what was she doing she said the churches that her son established outside of the conference she was there to dedicate those churches 1907. now here is a counter argument yeah but some of those churches decades after were brought back into the conference does that negate the statement ignorance a lack of mental Acumen Lord have mercy let's move on from that and there it is stay as you are you don't need to unite with them all right what year is this first line blue words 1901 who is Sister what writing to who was A.G Daniels General Conference president and what does she write she says pharisaism red words Ferry says him in the Christian world is what not extinct she says in the SDA church we have a Pharisees him so she's connecting the Sanhedrin council with the General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists what year is that in 1901 what does she say the regular lines may prove a failure and a want a sneer conference lines for instance 1901. 1901 again she says shall the regular lines which say every mind shall be what what's the word controlled not every working agency church should be under the control of the conference 1903 1907 1901 how many more statements you want every mind shall be controlled by two or three Minds at Battle Creek continue to Bear Swift well oh pastor we have 13 divisions now we have more than two or three it's not the amount of men is what you're teaching and what they're supporting and promoting that's the problem because if you have how many how many men ruled Israel in the time of King Saul was it not Samuel was he faithful to God let's move on shall men go to the regular lines to see whether they will be permitted to labor or shall they go out and work as best they can depending on their own work we don't need their ordination nor their approval go to work for God all right friend how much more let me see something here all right 1901 James Edson white she says the Lord has blessed my son in the south second sentence God grant that the voices which have been so quickly raised to say that all the money invested in the work must go through the appointed Channel at Battle Creek shall what not be heard Battle Creek today is what now there in Spring Michigan or the one in in Maryland DC Silver Spring Maryland it is their privilege to give what direct Aid and what assistance to missions that's it friends it's clear there it is again Edson white past that friends write this down that reference please very very important it says it is as hard today to break away from what what did you all hear that everybody read words what it says it is as hard today to break away from the regular lines as it was in whose day in Christ's day what does Breakaway mean huh what does Breakaway mean listen we have had great light let us not become narrow let us break the bonds which bind us hard to break away from what the regular lines now is Sister white saying Everybody Must Break Free at the conference but where their circumstances you can stand how separate alone with Christ with Christ with Christ okay go to John 15. do you know what is startling among these men they give you several quotes and hardly no Bible no Bible and that's why their statements and arguments are convoluted as we would say Tom foodery where are we going to John what chapter go to John 15. what does verse 1 say in John 15 friends what does Christ saying I am the what the true vine listen to what sister white says Bible Spirit of Prophecy this is the Desire of Ages she writes I am the True Vine listen the Jews had always regarded the vine as the most noble of plants and a type of all that was powerful excellent and fruitful Israel had been what represented as a what Vine which God had planted red words the Jews based the hope of Salvation on the fact of what friends their connection with Israel can Church connection save anybody what saves What Not Who what saves truth who saves who is he the way the truth the life listen what Christ now says I am the real Vine think not that through a connection with the church you may become partakers of the life of God and inheritors of his promise so me alone a spiritual life received that Bible and spirit of Prophecy how then could you believe that sister white is going to write anything different John 15 let's move on sister white rights the Pharisees declared themselves the children of Abraham Christ told them that this claim could be established only by doing what the works of Abraham blue words a mere lineal descent from Abraham was of no value without a spiritual connection with Christ your connection means nothing and that's what they're preaching stay in the church they're preaching salvation through the church and people are eating and drinking that Hook Line and Sinker deceive they haven't read nor prayed over this for themselves one more statement all the Desire of Ages all right it says descent do I want this one you could take note of the reference I'll move on from this one okay argue for this one page 107 paragraph one John the Baptist said the ax is laid weird at the root red words not by its name but by its fruit is the value of a tree determined if the fruit is worthless the name cannot save the tree from oh would the name save you was Seventh-Day Adventists save you I cannot save you what must we have what must we reveal what must we manifest the fruit last sentence profession was profession is worthless if our lives and characters are not in harmony with God's law we are not his people and Christ made this statement John 15 before he was crucified and Christ's crucifixion typifies the sunderl it's relevant right now and applicable let me see how much more of this I can give you than I'll close go to Matthew 15. where are we going to friends Matthew 15. let's take this Matthew 15 look at verse 7. what did Christ preacher give me 10. what did Christ preach in verse 7 and call the leaders Hypocrites right Hypocrites skip one down with me to verse number nine what were they teaching men's doctrines all right for God's Commandments and they were worshiping God in vain skip on down to verse number verse number 12. the disciples came to Christ Lord you offended the leaders of the church Christ the Christ apologize he said nothing wrong he spoke present truth no need for apology look at verse number 14. what did Christ say now verse 13 every plan my father had not planted shall be won rooted up let them alone what look at the statement the disciples had been much disappointed that Jesus had not tried to secure what everybody the cooperation of the leaders in Israel they felt it was a mistake for Jesus not to strengthen his cause by securing the support of these influential men past Enriquez why do you not work with the conference leaders ask them the same question and reverse it and see what they tell you that's them watch it says the corporation of such men listen as the disciples were anxious to secure would have betrayed the work of God into the hands of its home birth enemies is that clear friends some people will see this and still say I don't see it do you know why they're blind they're blind they're blind they're blind let's go to Lou chapter nine Bible Spirit of Prophecy where we're going to France Luke Chapter now look what this says in Luke chapter 9. let them alone by the way by the way hold your place in Luke 9 go to Acts 2 leave them alone acts what chapter now Acts chapter 2. this is on the day of Pentecost right probation had not yet been closed on the Jewish Church look at Acts chapter 2 verse 40. the disciples said to the people save yourselves from this world unto Ward Generations what's untoward mean corrupt meaning leave them alone verse 41 they were baptized verse 42 the people after being baptized did they go back to those apostate leaders yes or no did they my friends no they fellowshipped with whom those who had truth those of Our Truth Bible do you remember in John chapter 6 when the majority of Christ disciples left him and Christ turned to the twelve and said to them will you also go what did Peter say to whom shall we go you have what the words of eternal life so what were they following truth truth truth but those men went right back to the conference of that day before I take Luke 9 have you ever heard people say to rebut this sister white died in the church I wonder which church you got in sister white preach in the Adventist churches SDA churches she had credentials in the SDA churches so that must be used to negate her statements do you see the fallacy in the reasoning so because she died a Seventh-Day Adventist that must you be used to negate that she says on the several circumstances it's okay for churches Enterprises to stand separate from the conference control who would reason that way want to ask a question did Christ preach in the synagogues did he yes he did did sister white preach in the SDA churches yes she did did Jesus also simultaneously set up a Ministry Church training school baptizing people not with the Sanhedrin yeah did sister white simultaneously support Ministries churches schools not with the conference yeah so where's the problem it's in your minds that's where it is you have a Sinister agenda it's clear for those who want to see it is the Bible true go to Luke 9. Luke 9 you have to use Bible and spread of Prophecy and some people still won't believe this I am simply making sure it's on the record let me hear some my footsteps Luke chapter 9 in verse 49 and John answered Master we saw one doing what casting out devils in thy name what happened we forbade him why because he did not follow us he was not with our ministry do you realize that these were disciples not with the conference and yet they were telling Christ please support seek the approval of the Sanhedrin many of you who are sitting here might have the same sentiment Pastor henriquez I come to save to serve but please work with the conference please the same thing with Christ 12 disciples nothing new Under the Sun nothing new here they are now in Luke 9. they are saying Master this man is not under our ministry and control so he should not be preaching let's do everything on social media to shut him down let's misconstrue statements publish them to deceive the people to stop listening and following him same situation here go to verse 15. what did Christ say now you have done well no forbid him not why listen what sister white says here friend she says watch carefully come on where is it all right she says Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and that man didn't follow us listen now James and John had taught James and John had thought that in checking this man they had had in view their Lord's honor and listen to me these preachers on social media in the SDA Church they called themselves champions of the faith we are champions for the conference do you know who they are they are modern day Dr EK again who was Dr EK against have you read the book great controversy who was Dr Eck again Martin Luther the Protestant reformer they are the modern day Dr Eric okay listen James and John had thought that in checking this man they had had in viewed their Lord's honor they began to see that their reward they were what so what was at the root of all those polls and videos jealousy jealousy but afterwards they acknowledge their error and accepted Christ's reproof listen none who showed themselves in any way friendly to Christ if they are preaching present truth leave them alone listen now when Jesus was no longer personally among them and the work was left in their hands they must not indulge award narrow exclusive spirit but manifest the same Farm reaching sympathy which they had seen in whom in their master I digress on that point beloved do you realize question for you which of these two men began their Ministry first Jesus or John the Baptist who John the Baptist was John's Ministry with the conference of that day no what about Christ no all right when Christ came on the scene did he say John you have to close up shop you gotta you got to stop Ministry and join me that happen what happened both were working even John disciples didn't say we would stop preaching and John cries no they had separate Ministries that's Bible brothers and sisters Bible Bible this idea of everyone coming under one head is potpourri that's what it is let's close let's close let's close let's close go to numbers 11. where are we going to numbers 11. so New Testament go to Old Testament now now I won't read this but put the reference down numbers 11 verse 25 pardon me verse 24 numbers 11 verse 25 through verse 29. God gave his spirit upon 70 elders to help Moses in the work and out of 70 68 went one way and two did not follow the 68. do you know what Joshua did yeah the same Joshua he ran to Moses Moses you need to check these two men they won't follow us and what did Moses say Joshua do you know what's in your heart for those two men Envy Envy Old Testament jealousy New Testament look at verse 29 with me where are we going to it says and Moses now said unto Joshua enviest thou for my sake what God not all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them let's close now I keep saying that here it is Friends it says that watch carefully these men will never give the right mode to other minds they have not grown up to the first stature of men and women in Christ they simply live the name of Christian but they are not fitted for the work of God and never will be until they are born again and learned their ABCs in the religion of Christ Jesus red words there is hope in One Direction take the young man and woman and place them where they will come as little as possible in contact with who no no Babylon no Babylon our churches so was Sister white calling for a separation from the conference here's my last Point hold on I'm going to step on a tour right now did you wear your steel toe boots listen volume eight page 310 Our Savior did not encourage any to attend the rabbinical schools of his day no I won't drop the mic I'm going to hold the mic you see the world drops mics we don't drop Mike amen we hold the mics amen the world drop mics we don't drop mics we give the trumpet a certain sound this thing sound what would the rabbinical schools of his day be today name them Andrews Southern Loma Linda awkward name them puc La Sierra name them Walla Walla name them uh the one in Jamaica there ncu same thing the rabbinical school's office day that's it friends he wouldn't he would not so would that be classified as calling people out of church and when they go to when they go to our schools do they leave without debt or in debt the majority that's not God's will not God's will okay let me close right here beloved I've heard people say only conference churches are going to finish the work only people in the conference listen watch only people in the conference are going to finish the work who believes that raise a hand not one hand come on who believes that only people in the SD a conference will finish the work anything that will transpire in the last days we should find it in the Bible First Advent or before that at the first Advent which men first receive the early reign oh so I'm speaking to myself so Andrew which man first received the early Reign at the first Advent Pentecost the Sanhedrin people or the ones with Christ which one which the latter group the 120 to 120. worthy in the upper room where were the others in the dark and synagogues 120. 120. they received the Holy Spirit first I wonder why what were they following truth what were the other folks following man-made tradition do you see his friends hold on but were there some good folks over there you remember Nicodemus Pastor you said you were closing huh you said you were a closing pastor neither Joseph nor Nicodemus had openly accepted Christ while he was living they knew that such a step would exclude them from the conference Sanhedrin and they hope to protect Christ by the influence in its councils what does that mean we can stay in the conference and still preach president truth for a Time they had seemed to succeed listen but the Wily priests seeing their favor to Christ had thwarted their plans in their absence Christ had been what condemned delivered to be crucified now that Christ was dead they no longer Nicodemus no longer what concealed their attachment to him here's my point there's some pastors right now in the SDA conference who are timid and a fruit to stand for all the truth they will stand later on a few a few will stand later on we are biblical example for that I feel that's why you would never hear me say all our in apostasy there are few who will have to come out when Nicodemus and Joseph came out they had to separate themselves from what the apostate leadership they had to the leadership they had to some will come out but those who think now we can stay right here a day is going to come you'll have to make a decision make what a decision that's New Testament what about Obadiah in the time of whom Elijah Obadiah go tell Ahab Elijah is here what if I go and preach the Elijah's message to Ahab Ahab will chop off my head and that's why many conference pastors like Obadiah will not preach the Elijah's message calling even their own superiors to repentance they won't do it why paycheck why retirement why uh what else accolades why they don't want to be diffract why ordination why all of it afraid they're selling out cries for 30 pieces of silver 120 I'm closing now 120 received the Holy Spirit first and then they went out and began to preach the majority of the Jews had the last opportunity the majority rejected some came in accept the truth among those who came in the Bible says there were priests who came in they were priests let's be faithful to the Bible we don't have to skew the Bible to suit our sinful agenda preach the word some of them will come out of error and stand on the platform of Truth okay what have we learned today were things clearer were things made plain where things may play So if you think only force in the conference will finish this work you are ignorant of the Bible The Men Who first received the early Reign were men not with the conference how will it be in the last days who first will get the lettering oh pastor guys I can't see that only those who are living and following present truth wherever they are they will be the ones and if they're faithful they're not going to be supported by those men and we pray for them do you think Christ prayed for Caiaphas of course he did of course but was he praying for himself no he was not and that's where I close we have to pray for ourselves study for What study for ourselves we cannot just say follow truth we must know truth so we can follow through study for yourselves let's pray Father in heaven thank you for these words this evening may we take heed to what we have heard may we be found faithful firmly standing upon the Bible and spirit of Prophecy what you have joined together may we not put asunder or separate in order to accommodate our jealousies Envy towards others and our Sinister ulterior motives may we Heavenly Father be found as living examples of your truth may we not keep the angels on the outside in books on buildings on papers but may we allow them to come into our hearts convict convert and may we now go and share with others may we not eat the leaven of the apostates may we shun it and call people to truth may this place be a lighthouse locally and internationally now Lord we pray as we meet this new week Keep Us Faithful may we claim Matthew 6 give us this day our daily bread and may we not doubt you will provide Lord we love you and we know

today\n[21.2s] We Gather here\n[23.3s] this afternoon to dig deep into your\n[25.7s] words\n[27.3s] to bring clarity\n[29.7s] to the controversies all around us\n[32.9s] blessed us for these few moments\n[35.3s] grant us Heavenly I Salve that we may\n[39.1s] discern truth\n[41.8s] that we may also identify error\n[45.7s] under any guise\n[47.5s] bless us now we pray\n[49.4s] in the name of Jesus Christ amen\n[54.1s] I want to turn your attention to Luke\n[56.0s] Chapter 12. let's turn there Luke\n[59.0s] chapter 12.\n[61.9s] how many of you are\n[64.8s] anxious for tomorrow's\n[67.8s] service\n[70.1s] beginning of this\n[72.6s] final seven days on Earth\n[76.1s] experience\n[78.1s] seven Sanctuary feasts are you ready for\n[81.3s] it friends\n[83.2s] I'm ready by God's grace now this\n[87.0s] evening as we spend a few moments\n[88.9s] addressing these controversies I'm going\n[92.6s] to ask you kindly to get a writing\n[94.3s] instrument notepads and the questions\n[97.5s] that come to your mind as we go\n[99.9s] throughout this by God's grace at the\n[103.2s] end I will accommodate those questions\n[106.8s] I'm going to get my\n[109.7s] iPad by God's grace and those of you\n[112.4s] online can also tune in and send in your\n[117.2s] questions let's turn quickly to Luke\n[119.8s] chapter 12 and today we're going to\n[122.8s] continue from where we left off on this\n[126.3s] morning I was blessed this morning how\n[128.5s] about you\n[130.0s] were those points clear\n[131.9s] as we looked at the sanctuary\n[134.5s] you see friends everything that we\n[136.6s] profess to believe as Seventh-day\n[139.8s] Adventist we believe we can prove those\n[144.1s] truths from the Bible from the sanctuary\n[147.1s] am I right\n[148.3s] yes so what about the logo\n[151.3s] the actual brand of this church should\n[154.9s] we be able to prove that also from the\n[157.8s] sanctuary\n[158.8s] yes and that's why we are addressing\n[162.2s] this all-important subject that's not\n[165.6s] what God plays on his Tabernacle\n[169.4s] is that what he put dear friends\n[171.6s] some individuals have taken this logo\n[174.8s] and actually stated that apparent cross\n[179.4s] is actually inverted\n[183.7s] and inverted crosses are connected to\n[187.5s] witchcraft\n[189.7s] just follow the top end of that\n[193.0s] so-called cross\n[195.8s] when God speaks does he speak plainly\n[199.9s] and the churches with this and these\n[202.6s] logos on them if those Tabernacles were\n[206.8s] in the time of Moses and God inspired a\n[210.4s] sinner to bring his lamb what Christ\n[213.2s] have led that sinner to these\n[215.6s] Tabernacles\n[217.1s] why\n[218.9s] wrong address wrong address\n[222.8s] wrong symbol wrong address\n[226.7s] they call these three lines Three Angels\n[230.3s] they call that cherubims\n[232.4s] that is\n[234.2s] a disgrace to God there it is friends\n[237.7s] ecumenical\n[239.3s] ecumenical\n[241.3s] straight from Babylon now what if here\n[244.5s] at safe to serve one day you walked into\n[247.4s] the church and I had two logos in the\n[250.6s] front two logos in the center two logos\n[254.1s] on the walls\n[255.5s] The Three Angels on one side and the\n[258.7s] flickering Flame\n[260.6s] over a so-called book and a cross on the\n[263.6s] other side what would you think\n[267.2s] what would you think talk to me what\n[268.8s] what would come to your mind\n[270.5s] but I said you do not know what would\n[272.6s] have come to my mind you don't want to\n[274.1s] hear it what what would come to your\n[275.9s] mind\n[278.4s] if I lost my mind\n[281.0s] am I insane\n[283.4s] have I stepped off the platform what\n[285.8s] else\n[287.4s] am I confused\n[289.4s] do you know you have churches out there\n[292.3s] that claim to believe in present truth\n[296.3s] claim to be preaching the sermons and\n[300.2s] the messages for the hour and they have\n[303.1s] two logos why\n[306.0s] why would they have two logos The Three\n[308.9s] Angels on one side or maybe on a website\n[312.5s] that they oversee but at the actual\n[315.2s] church building they have that the\n[317.5s] flickering Flame\n[319.5s] from Babylon why would they do that\n[322.4s] what now\n[324.4s] double-minded want to please everybody\n[326.4s] that's called compromise\n[330.4s] one is of god Bible one is of Babylon of\n[334.2s] Satan that's compromise what would\n[336.6s] Elijah say\n[338.2s] if God be God\n[340.0s] serve him but if bail\n[342.6s] serve him how long hold you between\n[347.8s] two opinions not six friends that's\n[350.4s] called compromise that's called\n[352.3s] hypocrisy why because if you connect\n[355.9s] yourself with this organization they\n[358.7s] want to make sure you have that logo\n[361.9s] no there's several things I want to say\n[363.8s] here how many of you remember those days\n[366.0s] you went to some Churches especially if\n[368.6s] you are second third fourth generation\n[372.2s] SDA do you remember uh pardon me not\n[375.2s] that\n[376.7s] uh do you remember this logo here\n[379.9s] or even a rendition of it\n[382.6s] on the buildings\n[384.4s] the glass thin windows\n[386.7s] uh maybe I I took it out that the true\n[390.8s] logo\n[392.0s] right there in the center the true logo\n[394.1s] on the glass stand windows\n[397.3s] some Churches still had the logo there\n[400.1s] do you know why they have they have not\n[402.7s] gotten around to it yet\n[405.2s] to remodel it\n[407.0s] but soon they will\n[408.8s] and others may still have the logo but\n[411.9s] the message has changed\n[415.4s] the experience has changed\n[419.0s] am I right or wrong\n[420.6s] you know I'm speaking the truth as God\n[422.7s] lives and as you think about it as they\n[425.9s] have removed the logo\n[427.7s] they've also removed the message let's\n[430.6s] take a look at the first angel\n[432.7s] what says that first cherubim of chapter\n[435.8s] 14 of the Revelation verse 7 fear God\n[439.3s] right say it with me fear God give glory\n[443.0s] to him why the our office judgment is\n[446.4s] calm and worship him who made Heaven\n[449.7s] Earth sea and The Fountains of waters\n[452.2s] what's number one\n[453.8s] fear God what does it mean to fear God\n[457.0s] fear God fear God\n[459.2s] Victor overseen to despise and hate evil\n[463.6s] Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 13 the fear\n[467.0s] of the Lord is to hate evil Pride\n[470.7s] arrogancy how do we know they have\n[473.4s] changed the message are they not\n[475.7s] preaching we will never get victory over\n[478.2s] sin we'll be sinning until Christ comes\n[481.3s] what does that mean\n[483.0s] not only has the logo change but what\n[485.9s] the message has changed\n[488.9s] then comes give Glory what does that\n[491.4s] mean to give Glory\n[493.5s] Health reform dress reform tempering\n[496.4s] they are thrown out Health reform just\n[499.4s] reform Temperance what about judgment\n[502.6s] they've rejected October 22nd 1844.\n[506.6s] what about worship God on the seventh\n[509.0s] day Sabbath have you not heard do you\n[512.2s] not remember the actual cry that we want\n[516.0s] to hold Sabbath surfaces on Sunday\n[519.3s] mornings for those who have to work on\n[521.9s] Sabbath and cannot come to church on\n[524.7s] God's Sabbath day Sabbath you can come\n[527.1s] on Sunday mornings\n[529.0s] and our church\n[531.1s] why the logo has changed the merchandise\n[535.2s] has also changed\n[538.1s] that's it\n[540.1s] it would it would be weird as I said\n[542.6s] bizarre as I said this morning you walk\n[545.3s] into a Bed Bath and Beyond store and you\n[548.5s] see no what do they sell inside there\n[553.1s] so clothing they sell soap\n[557.5s] okay bath soap right okay and what else\n[560.8s] Etc you walk inside there and what are\n[563.1s] they selling\n[564.5s] watermelon\n[566.2s] cantaloupe come on now it's it's it's\n[568.8s] it's it's fall season okay\n[572.1s] broccoli\n[573.5s] collards\n[575.1s] right you would say where am I\n[578.7s] the sign is correct but the merchandise\n[581.8s] is incorrect or they don't have the sign\n[586.3s] and don't have the message\n[589.1s] Luke chapter 12 go to verse 1. it says\n[592.2s] be weary after laughing of whom the\n[595.7s] Pharisees which is what friends\n[598.3s] hypocrisy hypocrisy and that's why this\n[601.7s] morning I spent time on this\n[606.4s] this is God's true sign\n[610.3s] past that won't spend time on this okay\n[612.8s] everybody read the red words with me I\n[615.8s] was told that men will employ every\n[619.4s] policy to make less prominent the\n[622.1s] difference between the faith our\n[624.1s] Seventh-Day Adventists and those who\n[626.6s] observe the first day of the week past\n[629.2s] that all right friends okay now notice\n[632.6s] again they will say we must remove the\n[636.4s] banner or sign the banner or sign and\n[641.2s] what sign that God put on his building\n[643.1s] what sign is on new Jerusalem's\n[646.5s] Tabernacle the Angels at the gates on\n[650.1s] the Tabernacle gate and Tabernacle past\n[652.1s] that won't spend time on that okay I saw\n[655.0s] some reaching out their hands to remove\n[657.2s] the banner and to obscure fix that and\n[660.4s] to obscure its significance I don't want\n[663.5s] to keep you here too long all right\n[664.8s] let's move on from this\n[666.8s] we cannot know and what they want to say\n[670.1s] friends those who are standing faithful\n[673.1s] to God\n[674.8s] in observing the true message and the\n[678.7s] true logo that they are the ones who\n[681.5s] have started a new organization\n[684.9s] now I I wish I had something here\n[688.5s] on what side of the four corners or four\n[692.1s] sides of the sanctuary it was the good\n[694.5s] place on what side\n[696.3s] East Side so they traveled from where\n[699.2s] East to where West so what what\n[703.4s] direction did the Angels cherubims fly\n[707.8s] east to west from the gate to where the\n[711.5s] door of the Tabernacle holy Place inner\n[714.8s] Veil and then most holy is traveling\n[717.4s] we're east to west and that's why by\n[719.8s] God's grace we turn our logo with the\n[723.6s] angels with trumpets not going right to\n[727.0s] left\n[728.3s] but what\n[730.1s] not going left to right but what right\n[733.4s] to left East to West so when someone\n[736.3s] sees safe to serve's logo\n[739.9s] they'll ask a question why are your\n[742.4s] angels flying right to left\n[745.2s] what will you say\n[746.9s] let's go to the sanctuary\n[749.7s] these cherubims fly how right to left\n[753.5s] East to West will you say Amen friends\n[755.8s] we have to make sure we come as close to\n[759.2s] scripture as possible\n[762.0s] it's a sign\n[766.1s] what if someone says come meet me here\n[768.6s] and remove you remember we were going to\n[772.0s] evangelize and evangelist John Ryan sent\n[775.9s] me this uh the direction\n[778.3s] and instead of putting let's say other\n[780.6s] member of the address instead of putting\n[782.4s] uh John's Road he put John's Avenue\n[787.2s] well here we have John 1 and John's\n[789.5s] Avenue\n[790.8s] I'm looking for John's Avenue when it\n[793.2s] should be John's Road\n[795.0s] but John is correct but what's incorrect\n[798.4s] Avenue or road is it important now which\n[802.0s] direction you're flying\n[804.4s] or brothers and sisters is it important\n[806.4s] all right let's move on from that there\n[809.8s] it is friends you know what let's turn\n[811.7s] the first Timothy chapter three go there\n[814.3s] with me and First Timothy chapter three\n[817.6s] and verse number 16 God's word says uh\n[822.3s] without controversy great is the mystery\n[827.0s] of godliness\n[828.8s] greatest watch Friends the mystery of\n[832.4s] godliness\n[834.6s] and there is a controversy going on\n[837.2s] right now\n[838.4s] and that controversy is stay in the SDA\n[842.9s] churches\n[844.1s] versus\n[847.2s] come out of apostasy is that clear\n[850.1s] friends\n[851.0s] and those who give the latter cry come\n[854.0s] out of apostasy\n[856.3s] those in the former group who say you're\n[859.3s] calling people out of the SDA Church\n[863.5s] that's what they say\n[865.3s] that's hypocrisy that's not correct they\n[868.4s] are creating what we call a straw man\n[872.2s] because Andrew Enriquez yours truly have\n[874.8s] never said come out of SDA churches\n[879.3s] you have ordered me what have I always\n[881.2s] say\n[882.6s] come out of what a past State local SDA\n[886.8s] churches\n[888.1s] as well as come out of a prostate\n[892.0s] non-conference churches it goes both\n[895.0s] ways\n[897.1s] but when they preach and teach they're\n[899.4s] calling you to church organization\n[902.9s] volume 4 page two go to Isaiah chapter\n[905.6s] one where are you going to my friends\n[908.2s] Isaiah chapter one what makes our\n[911.3s] Seventh-day Adventist one more time red\n[913.9s] words notice how sister white quoted in\n[917.1s] the blue words the Three Angels messages\n[920.3s] of course she mentioned first and second\n[923.1s] that's present truth then she said a red\n[926.3s] word those who pass through these\n[929.0s] experiences are to be as firm as a rock\n[932.5s] to the principles that have made us what\n[936.1s] everybody Seventh Day Adventist volume\n[939.5s] what's that volume nine\n[942.1s] testimonies for the church volume 9 page\n[945.2s] 48 says let ministers and people bear in\n[948.9s] mind there may affect that their names\n[952.0s] are registered on the church's books\n[956.5s] will not save them oh but I thought if\n[959.8s] your name is not on a local conference\n[962.8s] SDA Church you're not going to be saved\n[968.7s] that was volume nine what page I gave\n[971.0s] you page 48 pass this won't spend time\n[974.9s] on that I covered that this morning we\n[977.6s] cannot now enter into any new\n[980.2s] Organization for this would mean a pass\n[983.8s] to see from the word everybody apostasy\n[986.5s] from the truth now watch this

as a body if we start teaching things\n[1262.6s] it's not biblical I'm going to leave I'm\n[1264.6s] leaving because my loyalty is to God\n[1266.7s] where's your loyalty\n[1269.5s] he's leaving where's he going\n[1273.3s] look at what is situated\n[1276.9s] on the bottom right of the screen what\n[1279.3s] is that\n[1281.1s] a logo\n[1282.4s] what is that\n[1283.9s] how many of you recall the first three\n[1285.8s] ABN logo\n[1287.4s] was that it\n[1288.8s] come on what's that it\n[1290.5s] was that it what is that\n[1295.2s] imagine God saying sinner come to this\n[1298.0s] Tabernacle with cherubims and he walks\n[1300.6s] up and you see three lines\n[1302.2s] where is the sign\n[1306.8s] so he may need to pack his bags right\n[1309.7s] but where is he going\n[1311.8s] and the Very sins he's protesting\n[1314.2s] against\n[1315.9s] in Loma Linda elsewhere\n[1319.0s] have been supported by leadership in the\n[1322.0s] general conference why do I say that the\n[1324.6s] mere fact that there are moaned and\n[1327.3s] silent\n[1328.6s] on the point it means that they're\n[1330.7s] complicit with the same apostasis\n[1334.5s] am I clear\n[1335.9s] all the points playing let's pray for\n[1338.0s] The Elder here let's move on my friends\n[1340.0s] watch this this is a controversial\n[1343.0s] statement\n[1344.1s] that has been floating around seventh\n[1347.4s] day adventism\n[1349.2s] and normally in Sabbath afternoons this\n[1352.0s] time around after evangelism we will go\n[1355.1s] into question and answer question and\n[1358.0s] answer so this question was posed\n[1361.0s] was posed\n[1363.2s] this statement is found on the white eg1\n[1368.7s] estate of egy writings all right friends\n[1372.5s] now this red box two small paragraphs\n[1376.2s] I'm gonna magnify those two paragraphs\n[1379.6s] okay it was written in 1901 September\n[1383.8s] 24th okay and many use this statement to\n[1389.4s] say\n[1390.1s] it doesn't matter what's happening in\n[1392.5s] the church stay in the churches now\n[1394.9s] watch there's no qualification given\n[1399.7s] so if there's apostasy in that local\n[1403.2s] church stay right there\n[1405.6s] say right there supported supported we I\n[1408.7s] don't teach that\n[1409.9s] wherever apostasy is among leadership\n[1413.7s] after you pray with after you consult\n[1417.8s] with if they continue to promote and\n[1421.4s] teach them the heresy\n[1423.6s] you should not stay there based on the\n[1426.4s] Bible and the spirit of Prophecy you\n[1428.3s] should not find somewhere else and go\n[1430.3s] you should not because by beholding you\n[1433.5s] become one changed and once you stay\n[1436.7s] there and support it you strengthen the\n[1439.8s] apostates\n[1441.3s] I'm not speaking about the pews\n[1443.4s] leadership I'm talking about\n[1446.0s] all right so we are going to be\n[1448.3s] addressing this statement here watch\n[1450.6s] carefully so friends here it is let not\n[1453.6s] the professed people of God think it's a\n[1456.7s] privilege to separate from conference\n[1460.6s] organization that they may show their\n[1464.0s] supposed efficiency and I think our\n[1466.5s] sisters here who also asked this\n[1468.2s] question several weeks ago\n[1470.4s] red words this is entirely opposed to\n[1474.2s] God's word\n[1476.2s] this is what friends\n[1477.9s] no no please talk back to me so I'm so\n[1480.4s] I'm clear that you're following the\n[1482.2s] bouncing ball this is entirely opposed\n[1485.5s] to God's order what is entirely opposed\n[1487.9s] to God's order\n[1490.0s] to separate from what conference\n[1492.4s] organization let's read on there is need\n[1496.0s] of perfect unity and love and this will\n[1499.9s] appear when we learn of Jesus it is the\n[1503.5s] plan of God that every church and every\n[1506.7s] conference shall cherish the feeling of\n[1509.7s] reciprocal dependence what friends\n[1512.8s] depending on each other or I depend on\n[1515.6s] you you depend on me reciprocal okay let\n[1518.3s] me ask you a question\n[1519.5s] if I say to you that this statement in\n[1522.4s] 1901 shouldn't you get every other\n[1525.1s] statement in sister-watch writings about\n[1528.3s] Ministries comma churches comma\n[1532.7s] publishing houses comma medical\n[1535.9s] missionary institutions comma not being\n[1540.7s] under schools comma not being under the\n[1543.9s] conference would you say Amen to that\n[1546.2s] that one statement Must Destroy every\n[1548.8s] other\n[1551.2s] who with intelligence would reason like\n[1554.5s] that\n[1556.0s] you take one statement that says it's\n[1559.3s] not in God's order to separate from the\n[1562.3s] conference organization use that to\n[1565.2s] destroy every other statement\n[1567.7s] that says the opposite and say look when\n[1570.9s] you read those are the statements they\n[1573.2s] must be understood based on this one\n[1576.4s] how could that be\n[1578.7s] that's the same argument the Sunday\n[1581.1s] people use to justify Sunday\n[1585.4s] what year is that written in\n[1587.9s] 1901 right September look at the\n[1590.4s] statement here\n[1591.3s] what year is this at the bottom\n[1593.9s] 1907 to whom their sister went right\n[1598.8s] Elder Daniels was actually the general\n[1601.9s] conference president\n[1604.4s] watch this statement when my advice was\n[1607.5s] asked in reference\n[1609.3s] to the Madison School the watch School\n[1612.1s] now when you hear school you're thinking\n[1614.3s] uh classroom setting\n[1617.2s] theater style uh a lectern and teacher\n[1621.9s] the Madison School means an Enterprise\n[1625.2s] right setting up training centers and\n[1629.6s] raising up schools churches medical\n[1633.2s] missionary sites and Publishing houses\n[1636.8s] watch this by the way let's go there\n[1639.3s] because I put it in your mind listen\n[1642.0s] located 10 miles Northeast of Nashville\n[1645.3s] Madison was an important spot in early\n[1649.8s] Southern Seventh-Day adventism\n[1653.7s] the Madison property often referred to\n[1656.9s] as a medicine farm so you have\n[1658.6s] management School management Farm was\n[1661.2s] purchased in what year\n[1663.1s] 1904 with the financial assistance of\n[1667.3s] Nelly uh Gillard and the prophetic\n[1671.1s] vision of Ellen White it says\n[1673.9s] spearheaded by EA Sutherland Percy Megan\n[1679.1s] the medicine contingent contingent now\n[1682.6s] would spawn a collection of what schools\n[1686.4s] hospitals Industries and what churches\n[1689.9s] around the South\n[1691.9s] so what were they establishing\n[1695.6s] all right watch careful now let's go\n[1699.2s] right here I'll come back to that watch\n[1701.8s] us now friends it says when my advice\n[1704.7s] was asked in reference to the Madison\n[1707.7s] School I said remain as you are there is\n[1712.9s] danger in binding every working agency\n[1717.7s] everyone\n[1719.8s] Elder Buchanan I mean should I go there\n[1722.7s] now\n[1723.9s] you say no are you my conscience\n[1726.2s] preacher listen I agree with you there\n[1729.1s] is a danger in binding every working\n[1732.0s] agency under the what friends the\n[1735.4s] dictation of the conference the Lord did\n[1738.6s] not design that this should be\n[1742.3s] so friends which statement was inspired\n[1744.7s] the 1901 or 1907 which one\n[1750.0s] which one was inspired\n[1752.5s] which one\n[1754.0s] both were inspired\n[1756.4s] so why the difference circumstances\n[1760.5s] what's the difference\n[1762.4s] circumstances now here is a counter\n[1765.1s] argument to this statement here on the\n[1767.3s] screen\n[1768.8s] some would say well that's true that's\n[1771.9s] how medicine began\n[1774.7s] not with the conference but later on in\n[1777.9s] years right later on maybe a decade\n[1780.7s] after or so some of the various\n[1783.7s] institutions they established came back\n[1786.9s] under the conference\n[1788.8s] so that means you must negate this\n[1791.1s] instruction here\n[1792.6s] who is in that way\n[1794.7s] because circumstances\n[1797.3s] changed does not destroy the council\n[1801.8s] that was given\n[1804.9s] have ever read in the Bible the Lord\n[1807.7s] repented\n[1809.8s] have you\n[1811.6s] why would God repent\n[1814.1s] that would be a good Bible question\n[1817.4s] so let me not give too much on that okay\n[1819.6s] but why did God repent\n[1823.4s] because circumstances changed so he\n[1827.8s] promised destruction right and what\n[1830.1s] happened it was coming but they were\n[1833.6s] they repented so God withheld it God\n[1838.1s] repented oh that's the answer right dear\n[1839.9s] friends can God sin\n[1841.9s] so repent it doesn't mean to sin and\n[1843.9s] repent and to convert amen so God\n[1846.7s] changed because\n[1848.3s] circumstances change he withheld\n[1851.2s] destruction one example Nineveh\n[1854.7s] minivan amen it's clear\n[1858.5s] God withheld destruction let's continue\n[1861.0s] it says the Lord did not design that\n[1864.4s] this should be what are the next two\n[1866.7s] words in blue\n[1870.3s] the circumstances were such\n[1873.1s] the burden-bearers in the Madison School\n[1876.4s] could not bind up their work with the\n[1879.6s] conference\n[1881.7s] I knew their situation and when many of\n[1885.3s] the leading men in our conferences\n[1888.3s] ignore them because they did not Place\n[1891.8s] their school\n[1893.6s] under the\n[1895.6s] the conference dictation I was shown\n[1898.6s] that they would not be helped by making\n[1902.0s] themselves amenable to what the\n[1905.5s] conference they had better remain as led\n[1909.1s] by God amenable to him to work out his\n[1913.3s] plans but this matter need not be blazed\n[1919.0s] abroad\n[1920.5s] so friends what if the circumstances\n[1924.1s] that were Rife and prevalent in this\n[1929.1s] time 1907\n[1930.9s] when the instruction was given what if\n[1933.9s] they are prevalent today\n[1937.1s] would it be okay then to follow the same\n[1939.6s] instructions\n[1942.2s] or do you not believe in inspiration\n[1946.2s] is inspiration\n[1948.3s] it was given because of circle says\n[1952.2s] are they alive in the world today so how\n[1955.3s] could you negate the statement and\n[1957.3s] because they can they say well later on\n[1959.8s] some of those churches were brought\n[1962.6s] under the conference\n[1964.4s] does that negate the instruction\n[1968.0s] sometimes men reason as if they are\n[1972.6s] infants\n[1974.7s] and it's either they are ignorant listen\n[1977.4s] attentively either they are ignorant or\n[1980.5s] they lack comprehension skills they lack\n[1983.8s] intelligence or they have a Sinister\n[1986.8s] agenda\n[1988.6s] I wonder what it is which one let's move\n[1991.2s] on Modern paragraph\n[1993.0s] it says means have been held from them\n[1996.3s] Madison because in the organization and\n[2000.2s] management of the Madison School it was\n[2003.3s] not placed under the control of the\n[2006.6s] conference\n[2008.8s] but the reason why this school wasn't\n[2012.2s] owned and controlled by the conference\n[2014.7s] have not been duly considered move on\n[2019.1s] then she said watch carefully friends\n[2022.4s] how much of this I want to give you\n[2025.2s] watch carefully you want all of it some\n[2027.2s] with all of it red words Huntsville\n[2030.2s] first sentence\n[2032.1s] Alabama Madison listen in the matter of\n[2036.0s] the Madison School there has been a\n[2038.5s] standing off from them because they were\n[2041.0s] not under the ownership and control of\n[2044.8s] some conference\n[2046.4s] all right it says this is a question\n[2050.3s] thou should sometimes be considered but\n[2054.0s] it is not the Lord's plan\n[2056.7s] that means should be withheld from\n[2059.9s] medicine because they were what\n[2063.0s] I want to ask you a question\n[2065.1s] what\n[2067.7s] antithesis do we hear to that statement\n[2072.9s] every tithe every offering must go weird\n[2081.5s] huh so you hear one thing but read\n[2084.5s] something else\n[2086.6s] Luke 12 verse 1 Beware of the hypocrisy\n[2091.1s] of the Pharisees the leaven of the\n[2094.3s] leaders hypocrisy that's what it says\n[2096.5s] right there that means means can go to\n[2099.2s] where institutions not connected to the\n[2102.7s] conference\n[2104.4s] let's read on\n[2105.8s] the attitude with some of our Brethren\n[2110.4s] have assumed\n[2112.8s] toward this Enterprise shows it is not\n[2116.7s] wise for every every working agency to\n[2120.8s] be under the dictation of conference\n[2123.6s] officers there are Harmony they're all\n[2127.1s] is that what sister white wrote they're\n[2129.3s] all no there are some\n[2132.7s] Enterprises on the one certain\n[2135.9s] conditions that will produce better\n[2138.6s] results if one standing alone\n[2143.0s] that's abc123\n[2148.8s] is that clear friends\n[2151.5s] now that's why you you would never hear\n[2154.4s] yours truly say\n[2156.7s] every church is in apostasy or everybody\n[2159.8s] come what I'm simply calling people out\n[2163.6s] of War apostasy wherever it is\n[2166.7s] conference lines or self-supporting\n[2169.8s] lines\n[2171.1s] now do we have to wait second do we have\n[2175.0s] to wait to see apostasy\n[2178.2s] and use that as the reason to stand\n[2181.1s] alone\n[2182.2s] no no no you don't have to give me a\n[2186.5s] Biblical example of that\n[2188.4s] where somebody didn't work with the\n[2191.2s] conference the sanhegan council but yet\n[2193.7s] stood alone in Ministry John the Baptist\n[2197.4s] who was he by the way before I get to\n[2199.7s] Christ who was he by the way John the\n[2201.3s] Baptist whose son was he\n[2204.4s] Zacharias who was Zacharias\n[2207.1s] high priest so in the natural order of\n[2210.5s] things\n[2211.4s] what and who what office should John the\n[2215.6s] Baptist have assumed\n[2219.3s] high priest priesthood but what happened\n[2221.8s] God didn't call him to become a high\n[2224.7s] priest a pastor an elder in the\n[2227.9s] Sanhedrin Conference of synagogues he\n[2231.5s] had a self-supporting and independent\n[2234.0s] Ministry of the conference\n[2239.7s] song\n[2240.9s] Enterprises can stand alone\n[2244.5s] I'm going to say this\n[2247.0s] many of these men\n[2249.3s] they frame their talking points as if\n[2253.3s] there's only one side\n[2255.8s] that has an issue\n[2257.9s] as if you folks over here who are\n[2260.4s] self-supporting you despise the brethren\n[2263.9s] in the conference and separate yourself\n[2266.6s] you will never hear them look on the\n[2268.9s] other angle\n[2270.3s] and say those men in the conference\n[2272.7s] don't want to hear truth\n[2276.9s] hypocrisy\n[2279.1s] and they in the conference will never\n[2281.8s] invite some men to come and preach in\n[2284.1s] their pulpits\n[2286.3s] it's always one perspective\n[2289.5s] Sinister agenda\n[2291.7s] when you can be balanced\n[2293.9s] you can be bought and sold you're a\n[2297.1s] Slave\n[2298.5s] let's move on from that I told you\n[2301.4s] you're going to get it\n[2303.0s] what year is this at the bottom what\n[2305.1s] year\n[2306.9s] what year\n[2308.9s] do you remember hold on because\n[2310.3s] everything I say I must give you\n[2312.4s] receipts receipts you remember a man\n[2315.6s] whose name is he's alive Bill not\n[2319.5s] and he wrote an article says time to\n[2323.4s] marginalize\n[2325.2s] he says it's time to ostracize men like\n[2329.4s] dog Bachelor\n[2331.9s] anyone\n[2333.4s] who preaches against women's ordination\n[2338.2s] should not be brought into SDA pulpits\n[2341.6s] what is that\n[2343.4s] separation right\n[2346.4s] let's come here what year is this on the\n[2349.7s] screen friends\n[2350.9s] 1903 okay notice now this is Ellen White\n[2355.4s] and she's speaking of her son Edson\n[2358.5s] white that's the first two sentences\n[2361.3s] blue words just a white rights he it's\n[2364.9s] in white her son will be accounted out\n[2368.3s] of what\n[2369.4s] out of line but many\n[2373.1s] ought to be out of the lines that have\n[2376.2s] been maintained to be the regular\n[2378.8s] routine\n[2380.5s] how many\n[2381.8s] no some few many and unless they\n[2386.9s] themselves the conference line come into\n[2390.2s] line they will say we are God's Church\n[2395.2s] so the conference Brethren will say we\n[2398.3s] are God's Temple we are God's Church\n[2401.4s] sister white says unless that Temple is\n[2404.7s] purified cleansed and Sanctified God\n[2407.6s] would not give them his presence in the\n[2410.3s] temple of which they boast\n[2412.9s] those who would have rejoiced to see\n[2415.4s] something done\n[2416.7s] were all determined to give one no\n[2420.2s] recognition to whom it's in white as a\n[2423.6s] person or the one his work\n[2426.6s] why because he did not work in the\n[2431.8s] break what is a regular lines the\n[2434.0s] conference what year is that\n[2437.2s] but they caught 1901.\n[2440.3s] now which one\n[2442.3s] which one came after 1901\n[2445.9s] oh friends listen God has presented\n[2449.7s] before you how he regarded the regular\n[2453.5s] lines it says it needs to be broken as a\n[2458.0s] word a partridge vessel is broken\n[2461.0s] and what reconstructed how could you say\n[2464.3s] 1901 Must Destroy this statement\n[2468.1s] put this reference down\n[2470.1s] in great controversy\n[2474.8s] 371 sister white rights she says\n[2479.5s] not one statement should be used not\n[2484.4s] once saying of Christ let's fix it\n[2486.7s] properly not one thing of Christ should\n[2490.6s] be used to destroy another you can't do\n[2494.8s] that friends they're all inspired let's\n[2497.6s] let's move on\n[2499.0s] now look at this statement here what\n[2502.2s] year is that at the bottom\n[2505.5s] 1907\n[2507.0s] where was Sister white in 1907 or even\n[2510.3s] before 1907 where was she because I mean\n[2513.5s] that was when it was written where was\n[2515.0s] she what was she doing she said the\n[2518.7s] churches\n[2519.8s] that her son established outside of the\n[2523.8s] conference she was there to dedicate\n[2526.1s] those churches\n[2528.1s] 1907.\n[2529.8s] now here is a counter argument yeah but\n[2532.9s] some of those churches decades after\n[2535.8s] were brought back into the conference\n[2538.1s] does that negate the statement\n[2543.0s] ignorance a lack of mental Acumen Lord\n[2547.1s] have mercy let's move on from that and\n[2549.8s] there it is\n[2551.2s] stay as you are you don't need to unite\n[2554.3s] with them\n[2555.3s] all right what year is this first line\n[2558.5s] blue words\n[2560.1s] 1901 who is Sister what writing to\n[2564.6s] who was A.G Daniels\n[2567.2s] General Conference president and what\n[2570.2s] does she write she says pharisaism red\n[2573.8s] words Ferry says him in the Christian\n[2576.5s] world is what not extinct\n[2580.1s] she says in the SDA church we have a\n[2583.8s] Pharisees him\n[2585.8s] so she's connecting\n[2588.4s] the Sanhedrin council with the General\n[2592.2s] Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists\n[2597.6s] what year is that in 1901 what does she\n[2601.1s] say the regular lines may prove a\n[2605.0s] failure and a want a sneer\n[2608.1s] conference lines for instance 1901.\n[2611.2s] 1901 again she says shall the regular\n[2616.0s] lines which say every mind shall be what\n[2620.2s] what's the word controlled\n[2623.5s] not every working agency church should\n[2627.8s] be under the control of the conference\n[2630.6s] 1903 1907 1901 how many more statements\n[2635.6s] you want\n[2637.0s] every mind shall be controlled by two or\n[2639.7s] three Minds at Battle Creek continue to\n[2642.7s] Bear Swift well oh pastor we have 13\n[2645.5s] divisions now\n[2647.2s] we have more than two or three\n[2649.8s] it's not the amount of men is what\n[2651.9s] you're teaching\n[2653.3s] and what they're supporting and\n[2654.8s] promoting that's the problem because if\n[2657.2s] you have how many how many men\n[2660.0s] ruled Israel in the time of King Saul\n[2665.1s] was it not Samuel\n[2666.7s] was he faithful to God\n[2668.8s] let's move on shall men go\n[2671.9s] to the regular lines to see whether they\n[2675.6s] will be permitted to labor or shall they\n[2678.6s] go out and work as best they can\n[2683.0s] depending on their own work\n[2686.9s] we don't need their ordination nor their\n[2690.2s] approval go to work for God all right\n[2693.6s] friend how much more let me see\n[2696.2s] something here all right 1901 James\n[2700.1s] Edson white she says the Lord has\n[2703.4s] blessed my son in the south\n[2705.5s] second sentence God grant that the\n[2709.0s] voices which have been so quickly raised\n[2712.7s] to say that all the money\n[2716.0s] invested in the work must go through the\n[2720.6s] appointed Channel at Battle Creek shall\n[2723.5s] what\n[2725.1s] not be heard\n[2726.5s] Battle Creek today is what now\n[2730.2s] there in Spring\n[2731.9s] Michigan or\n[2734.4s] the one in in Maryland DC\n[2737.6s] Silver Spring Maryland it is their\n[2741.1s] privilege to give what direct Aid and\n[2744.3s] what assistance to missions that's it\n[2747.5s] friends it's clear\n[2749.1s] there it is again Edson white past that\n[2752.1s] friends write this down that reference\n[2754.8s] please very very important\n[2757.2s] it says it is as hard today\n[2761.1s] to break away from what what\n[2764.6s] did you all hear that everybody read\n[2768.3s] words what it says it is as hard today\n[2773.5s] to break away from the regular lines as\n[2779.0s] it was in whose day in Christ's day\n[2782.5s] what does Breakaway mean\n[2786.5s] huh what does Breakaway mean\n[2792.2s] listen we have had great light let us\n[2796.4s] not become narrow let us break the bonds\n[2800.7s] which bind us\n[2803.5s] hard to break away from what\n[2806.3s] the regular lines\n[2810.6s] now is Sister white saying Everybody\n[2812.6s] Must Break Free at the conference\n[2815.1s] but where their circumstances you can\n[2817.8s] stand how separate alone with Christ\n[2821.4s] with Christ with Christ okay go to John\n[2825.5s] 15.\n[2827.0s] do you know what is startling among\n[2828.8s] these men\n[2830.3s] they give you several quotes and hardly\n[2834.0s] no Bible\n[2836.2s] no Bible\n[2837.5s] and that's why their statements and\n[2840.7s] arguments are convoluted\n[2844.5s] as we would say Tom foodery\n[2846.7s] where are we going to John what chapter\n[2848.5s] go to John 15. what does verse 1 say in\n[2852.0s] John 15 friends what does Christ saying\n[2855.5s] I am the what the true vine listen to\n[2859.8s] what sister white says Bible Spirit of\n[2861.9s] Prophecy this is the Desire of Ages\n[2866.1s] she writes I am the True Vine listen the\n[2870.0s] Jews had always regarded\n[2873.4s] the vine as the most noble of plants\n[2877.8s] and a type of all that was powerful\n[2881.5s] excellent and fruitful\n[2884.6s] Israel had been what\n[2887.0s] represented as a what Vine\n[2890.3s] which God had planted red words the Jews\n[2895.2s] based the hope of Salvation on the fact\n[2899.1s] of what friends their connection with\n[2902.0s] Israel\n[2904.9s] can Church connection save anybody\n[2909.0s] what saves What Not Who what saves truth\n[2913.1s] who saves\n[2914.6s] who is he the way the truth the life\n[2918.6s] listen what Christ now says I am the\n[2922.7s] real Vine think not that through a\n[2927.0s] connection with the church you may\n[2929.8s] become partakers of the life of God and\n[2934.2s] inheritors of his promise\n[2937.1s] so me alone a spiritual life received\n[2941.9s] that Bible and spirit of Prophecy\n[2946.0s] how then could you believe that sister\n[2948.8s] white is going to write anything\n[2950.6s] different\n[2953.2s] John 15 let's move on\n[2956.1s] sister white rights the Pharisees\n[2958.9s] declared themselves the children of\n[2962.1s] Abraham\n[2964.5s] Christ told them that this claim could\n[2967.9s] be established only by doing what the\n[2971.5s] works of Abraham\n[2974.1s] blue words a mere lineal descent from\n[2978.8s] Abraham was of no value without a\n[2983.1s] spiritual connection with Christ your\n[2986.1s] connection means nothing\n[2989.8s] and that's what they're preaching stay\n[2992.1s] in the church they're preaching\n[2994.2s] salvation through the church\n[2996.6s] and people are eating and drinking that\n[2999.6s] Hook Line and Sinker deceive they\n[3002.5s] haven't read nor prayed over this for\n[3005.3s] themselves\n[3006.7s] one more statement all the Desire of\n[3009.2s] Ages\n[3010.3s] all right it says descent do I want this\n[3014.1s] one\n[3015.7s] you could take note of the reference\n[3018.1s] I'll move on from this one okay\n[3020.9s] argue for this one page 107 paragraph\n[3024.0s] one John the Baptist said the ax is laid\n[3028.3s] weird at the root\n[3030.5s] red words not by its name but by its\n[3035.3s] fruit is the value of a tree determined\n[3040.1s] if the fruit is worthless\n[3044.2s] the name cannot save the tree from\n[3048.6s] oh\n[3050.6s] would the name save you was Seventh-Day\n[3054.1s] Adventists save you I cannot save you\n[3056.8s] what must we have what must we reveal\n[3059.9s] what must we manifest the fruit last\n[3063.7s] sentence profession was profession is\n[3068.8s] worthless\n[3071.2s] if our lives and characters are not in\n[3075.2s] harmony with God's law we are not his\n[3079.2s] people\n[3083.3s] and Christ made this statement John 15\n[3086.7s] before he was crucified\n[3090.1s] and Christ's crucifixion typifies the\n[3093.1s] sunderl\n[3095.5s] it's relevant right now and applicable\n[3097.6s] let me see how much more of this I can\n[3099.6s] give you than I'll close\n[3102.6s] go to Matthew 15.\n[3105.1s] where are we going to friends\n[3107.6s] Matthew 15.\n[3109.4s] let's take this Matthew 15 look at verse\n[3113.1s] 7.\n[3114.7s] what did Christ preacher give me 10.\n[3118.7s] what did Christ preach in verse 7 and\n[3121.7s] call the leaders\n[3123.7s] Hypocrites right Hypocrites skip one\n[3126.9s] down with me to verse number nine what\n[3129.5s] were they teaching\n[3132.9s] men's doctrines\n[3135.4s] all right for God's Commandments and\n[3138.8s] they were worshiping God in vain skip on\n[3141.1s] down to verse number verse number 12.\n[3145.3s] the disciples came to Christ Lord you\n[3148.9s] offended\n[3150.6s] the leaders of the church\n[3153.7s] Christ the Christ apologize\n[3157.3s] he said nothing wrong he spoke present\n[3160.3s] truth no need for apology look at verse\n[3163.7s] number 14. what did Christ say now verse\n[3166.0s] 13 every plan\n[3168.0s] my father\n[3169.5s] had not planted shall be won rooted up\n[3172.6s] let them alone what\n[3176.0s] look at the statement\n[3177.7s] the disciples had been much disappointed\n[3182.0s] that Jesus had not tried to secure what\n[3186.6s] everybody\n[3189.2s] the cooperation of the leaders in Israel\n[3194.0s] they felt it was a mistake for Jesus not\n[3199.1s] to strengthen his cause by securing the\n[3203.2s] support\n[3204.3s] of these influential men\n[3207.9s] past Enriquez why do you not work with\n[3211.6s] the conference leaders\n[3214.6s] ask them the same question\n[3216.8s] and reverse it and see what they tell\n[3219.4s] you\n[3220.4s] that's them\n[3223.4s] watch it says the corporation of such\n[3228.4s] men\n[3229.7s] listen as the disciples were anxious to\n[3234.2s] secure would have betrayed the work of\n[3238.0s] God into the hands of its home birth\n[3242.0s] enemies\n[3244.7s] is that clear friends\n[3249.0s] some people will see this and still say\n[3251.5s] I don't see it do you know why\n[3255.8s] they're blind\n[3257.6s] they're blind\n[3259.0s] they're blind\n[3260.8s] they're blind\n[3262.3s] let's go to Lou chapter nine\n[3265.4s] Bible Spirit of Prophecy where we're\n[3267.3s] going to France\n[3269.0s] Luke Chapter now look what this says in\n[3271.1s] Luke chapter 9. let them alone by the\n[3275.3s] way by the way hold your place in Luke 9\n[3277.6s] go to Acts 2 leave them alone\n[3280.9s] acts what chapter now\n[3282.9s] Acts chapter 2. this is on the day of\n[3286.9s] Pentecost right\n[3289.1s] probation had not yet been closed on the\n[3292.7s] Jewish Church look at Acts chapter 2\n[3295.1s] verse 40.\n[3297.9s] the disciples said to the people\n[3301.3s] save yourselves from this world unto\n[3304.9s] Ward Generations what's untoward mean\n[3308.2s] corrupt\n[3309.5s] meaning leave them alone verse 41 they\n[3313.7s] were baptized\n[3315.3s] verse 42 the people after being baptized\n[3320.0s] did they go back\n[3323.6s] to those apostate leaders yes or no did\n[3326.7s] they my friends no they fellowshipped\n[3329.8s] with whom\n[3331.1s] those who had truth\n[3333.6s] those of Our Truth Bible do you remember\n[3336.8s] in John chapter 6\n[3340.6s] when the majority of Christ disciples\n[3343.5s] left him\n[3345.9s] and Christ turned to the twelve and said\n[3349.0s] to them will you also go\n[3351.7s] what did Peter say\n[3354.0s] to whom shall we go\n[3356.2s] you have what the words of eternal life\n[3359.8s] so what were they following\n[3362.3s] truth\n[3363.7s] truth truth but those men went right\n[3366.7s] back to the conference of that day\n[3370.7s] before I take Luke 9 have you ever heard\n[3373.6s] people say\n[3374.7s] to rebut this sister white died in the\n[3378.1s] church\n[3378.9s] I wonder which church you got in\n[3382.5s] sister white preach in the Adventist\n[3384.8s] churches SDA churches\n[3387.2s] she had credentials in the SDA churches\n[3391.3s] so that must be used to negate her\n[3395.0s] statements\n[3396.4s] do you see the fallacy in the reasoning\n[3400.1s] so because she died a Seventh-Day\n[3402.8s] Adventist\n[3404.4s] that must you be used to negate that she\n[3407.4s] says on the several circumstances\n[3411.9s] it's okay for churches Enterprises to\n[3416.2s] stand separate\n[3417.8s] from the conference control\n[3421.6s] who would reason that way\n[3424.4s] want to ask a question\n[3425.9s] did Christ preach in the synagogues\n[3429.2s] did he yes he did did sister white\n[3432.1s] preach in the SDA churches yes she did\n[3436.0s] did Jesus also simultaneously set up a\n[3440.6s] Ministry Church training school\n[3443.5s] baptizing people not with the Sanhedrin\n[3446.9s] yeah did sister white simultaneously\n[3450.1s] support Ministries churches schools not\n[3454.7s] with the conference yeah\n[3461.0s] so where's the problem\n[3463.2s] it's in your minds\n[3464.9s] that's where it is you have a Sinister\n[3467.2s] agenda\n[3468.8s] it's clear for those who want to see it\n[3472.6s] is the Bible true\n[3474.3s] go to Luke 9. Luke 9 you have to use\n[3477.9s] Bible and spread of Prophecy\n[3480.4s] and some people still won't believe this\n[3482.5s] I am simply making sure it's on the\n[3485.8s] record let me hear some my footsteps\n[3487.8s] Luke chapter 9 in verse 49 and John\n[3492.2s] answered\n[3494.0s] Master we saw one doing what casting out\n[3498.3s] devils in thy name\n[3500.4s] what happened we forbade him why\n[3505.0s] because he did not follow us he was not\n[3509.0s] with our ministry\n[3512.9s] do you realize that these were disciples\n[3516.2s] not with the conference\n[3518.6s] and yet they were telling Christ please\n[3520.9s] support seek the approval of the\n[3524.8s] Sanhedrin many of you who are sitting\n[3527.3s] here might have the same sentiment\n[3530.5s] Pastor henriquez I come to save to serve\n[3533.8s] but please work with the conference\n[3535.7s] please\n[3537.5s] the same thing with Christ 12 disciples\n[3542.2s] nothing new Under the Sun\n[3545.1s] nothing new here they are now in Luke 9.\n[3548.9s] they are saying Master this man is not\n[3552.5s] under our ministry and control so he\n[3556.5s] should not be preaching\n[3558.2s] let's do everything on social media to\n[3562.0s] shut him down\n[3563.6s] let's misconstrue statements publish\n[3567.1s] them to deceive the people to stop\n[3569.8s] listening and following him\n[3572.1s] same situation here\n[3574.1s] go to verse 15. what did Christ say now\n[3576.8s] you have done well no\n[3579.3s] forbid him not why\n[3584.4s] listen what sister white says here\n[3586.1s] friend she says watch carefully come on\n[3588.9s] where is it\n[3593.0s] all right\n[3594.8s] she says Master we saw one casting out\n[3598.8s] devils in thy name\n[3600.5s] and that man didn't follow us listen now\n[3603.7s] James and John had taught James and John\n[3608.1s] had thought that in checking this man\n[3611.8s] they had had in view their Lord's honor\n[3615.7s] and listen to me these preachers on\n[3618.8s] social media in the SDA Church they\n[3621.6s] called themselves champions of the faith\n[3624.5s] we are champions for the conference\n[3627.4s] do you know who they are\n[3629.0s] they are modern day Dr EK\n[3632.2s] again\n[3633.8s] who was Dr EK against\n[3637.2s] have you read the book great controversy\n[3640.0s] who was Dr Eck again\n[3642.4s] Martin Luther the Protestant reformer\n[3646.0s] they are the modern day Dr Eric\n[3649.6s] okay listen James and John had thought\n[3653.0s] that in checking this man they had had\n[3656.0s] in viewed their Lord's honor they began\n[3658.7s] to see that their reward\n[3661.4s] they were what so what was at the root\n[3664.3s] of all those polls and videos jealousy\n[3670.2s] jealousy\n[3671.6s] but afterwards they acknowledge their\n[3674.2s] error and accepted Christ's reproof\n[3678.0s] listen none who showed themselves in any\n[3681.4s] way friendly to Christ if they are\n[3684.2s] preaching present truth leave them\n[3687.8s] alone\n[3690.1s] listen now when Jesus was no longer\n[3693.6s] personally among them\n[3695.7s] and the work was left in their hands\n[3698.8s] they must not indulge award narrow\n[3703.3s] exclusive spirit\n[3705.5s] but manifest the same Farm reaching\n[3709.2s] sympathy which they had seen in whom in\n[3712.6s] their master\n[3714.4s] I digress on that point\n[3716.9s] beloved do you realize question for you\n[3721.0s] which of these two men began their\n[3723.7s] Ministry first\n[3725.9s] Jesus or John the Baptist\n[3729.2s] who\n[3730.7s] John the Baptist was John's Ministry\n[3733.3s] with the conference of that day no what\n[3735.4s] about Christ no all right when Christ\n[3738.4s] came on the scene did he say John you\n[3740.6s] have to close up shop\n[3742.1s] you gotta you got to stop Ministry and\n[3744.3s] join me\n[3745.9s] that happen\n[3747.2s] what happened\n[3748.7s] both were working\n[3750.9s] even John disciples didn't say we would\n[3754.4s] stop preaching and John cries no they\n[3757.1s] had separate Ministries\n[3759.8s] that's Bible brothers and sisters Bible\n[3763.6s] Bible\n[3765.2s] this idea of everyone

right mode to other minds they have not\n[3868.3s] grown up to the first stature of men and\n[3871.9s] women in Christ they simply live the\n[3875.2s] name of Christian but they are not\n[3877.8s] fitted for the work of God\n[3880.6s] and never will be until they are born\n[3884.1s] again and learned their ABCs in the\n[3888.1s] religion of Christ Jesus red words there\n[3891.6s] is hope in One Direction\n[3894.2s] take the young man and woman and place\n[3897.7s] them where they will come as little as\n[3901.3s] possible in contact with who\n[3904.4s] no no Babylon\n[3906.5s] no

the rabbinical school's\n[3987.9s] office day that's it friends he wouldn't\n[3991.1s] he would not\n[3993.1s] so would that be classified as calling\n[3995.5s] people out of church\n[3997.0s] and when they go to when they go to our\n[3999.7s] schools do they leave\n[4002.5s] without debt or in debt the majority\n[4006.2s] that's not God's will\n[4008.0s] not God's will okay let me close right\n[4009.9s] here\n[4010.7s] beloved\n[4012.0s] I've heard people say\n[4014.5s] only conference churches are going to\n[4017.8s] finish the work\n[4019.7s] only people in the conference listen\n[4022.4s] watch\n[4026.2s] only people in the conference are going\n[4028.6s] to finish the work\n[4030.5s] who believes that raise a hand\n[4032.6s] not one hand come on who believes that\n[4035.0s] only people in the SD a conference will\n[4038.6s] finish the work\n[4040.9s] anything that will transpire in the last\n[4043.8s] days we should find it in the Bible\n[4046.8s] First Advent or before that\n[4049.3s] at the first Advent\n[4051.9s] which men first receive the early reign\n[4059.1s] oh so I'm speaking to myself so Andrew\n[4061.6s] which man first received the early Reign\n[4064.5s] at the first Advent Pentecost the\n[4067.8s] Sanhedrin people or the ones with Christ\n[4072.8s] which one\n[4074.2s] which the latter group the 120\n[4078.3s] to 120.\n[4082.5s] worthy in the upper room\n[4086.0s] where were the others\n[4087.8s] in the dark and synagogues 120. 120.\n[4092.2s] they received the Holy Spirit first\n[4095.5s] I wonder why what were they following\n[4099.3s] truth\n[4100.8s] what were the other folks following\n[4103.7s] man-made tradition do you see his\n[4106.2s] friends\n[4107.1s] hold on but were there some good folks\n[4109.2s] over there\n[4110.5s] you remember Nicodemus\n[4114.1s] Pastor you said you were closing\n[4117.6s] huh you said you were a closing pastor\n[4120.6s] neither Joseph nor Nicodemus had openly\n[4125.3s] accepted Christ while he was living\n[4129.9s] they knew that such a step\n[4133.7s] would exclude them from the conference\n[4137.4s] Sanhedrin and they hope to protect\n[4140.4s] Christ by the influence in its councils\n[4144.0s] what does that mean we can stay in the\n[4146.9s] conference and still preach president\n[4148.5s] truth\n[4150.9s] for a Time they had seemed to succeed\n[4155.8s] listen\n[4157.3s] but the Wily priests\n[4159.9s] seeing their favor to Christ had\n[4162.7s] thwarted their plans\n[4164.6s] in their absence Christ had been what\n[4167.9s] condemned delivered to be crucified now\n[4171.8s] that Christ was dead\n[4173.9s] they no longer Nicodemus no longer what\n[4178.8s] concealed their attachment to him here's\n[4181.6s] my point there's some pastors right now\n[4185.5s] in the SDA conference\n[4187.9s] who are timid\n[4190.0s] and a fruit to stand for all the truth\n[4193.2s] they will stand later on a few a few\n[4196.8s] will stand later on we are biblical\n[4199.2s] example for that I feel that's why you\n[4201.6s] would never hear me say all our in\n[4203.5s] apostasy\n[4204.7s] there are few who will have to come out\n[4207.3s] when Nicodemus and Joseph came out\n[4211.3s] they had to separate themselves from\n[4213.4s] what the apostate leadership they had to\n[4215.8s] the leadership they had to\n[4217.8s] some will come out but those who think\n[4220.3s] now we can stay right here a day is\n[4223.6s] going to come you'll have to make a\n[4225.9s] decision\n[4227.5s] make what a decision\n[4230.7s] that's New Testament what about Obadiah\n[4235.8s] in the time of whom Elijah\n[4239.1s] Obadiah go tell Ahab Elijah is here what\n[4243.3s] if I go and preach the Elijah's message\n[4248.5s] to Ahab Ahab will chop off my head\n[4253.6s] and that's why many conference pastors\n[4256.4s] like Obadiah will not preach the\n[4259.8s] Elijah's message calling even their own\n[4263.3s] superiors to repentance they won't do it\n[4267.0s] why paycheck why retirement why uh what\n[4272.6s] else accolades why they don't want to be\n[4275.7s] diffract why ordination why all of it\n[4279.3s] afraid they're selling out cries for 30\n[4283.0s] pieces of silver\n[4287.1s] 120\n[4288.7s] I'm closing now\n[4291.4s] 120 received\n[4294.6s] the Holy Spirit first and then they went\n[4298.3s] out and began to preach\n[4300.4s] the majority of the Jews had the last\n[4303.7s] opportunity the majority rejected\n[4307.0s] some came in accept the truth among\n[4310.1s] those who came in the Bible says there\n[4312.9s] were priests who came in\n[4315.3s] they were priests let's be faithful to\n[4317.2s] the Bible we don't have to skew the\n[4319.9s] Bible to suit our sinful agenda preach\n[4323.7s] the word\n[4324.9s] some of them will come out of error and\n[4328.3s] stand on the platform of Truth\n[4331.0s] okay what have we learned today\n[4335.0s] were things clearer\n[4337.7s] were things made plain\n[4340.0s] where things may play So if you think\n[4341.9s] only force in the conference will finish\n[4345.2s] this work\n[4346.3s] you are ignorant of the Bible\n[4349.5s] The Men Who first received the early\n[4351.8s] Reign were men not with the conference\n[4355.1s] how will it be in the last days\n[4357.1s] who first will get the lettering\n[4361.3s] oh pastor\n[4362.9s] guys I can't see that\n[4365.4s] only those who are living and following\n[4368.8s] present truth wherever they are they\n[4372.3s] will be the ones and if they're faithful\n[4373.9s] they're not going to be supported by\n[4377.5s] those men and we pray for them\n[4380.8s] do you think Christ prayed for Caiaphas\n[4383.1s] of course he did\n[4385.7s] of course but was he praying for himself\n[4388.0s] no he was not and that's where I close\n[4390.3s] we have to pray for ourselves study for\n[4392.8s] What study for ourselves\n[4395.1s] we cannot just say follow truth we must\n[4398.1s] know truth so we can follow through\n[4400.9s] study for yourselves let's pray\n[4409.5s] Father in heaven\n[4413.1s] thank you for these words this evening\n[4416.4s] may we take heed\n[4418.6s] to what we have heard may we be found\n[4421.1s] faithful\n[4422.6s] firmly standing upon the Bible and\n[4425.6s] spirit of Prophecy\n[4427.1s] what you have joined together may we not\n[4430.2s] put asunder or separate in order\n[4433.7s] to accommodate our jealousies Envy\n[4437.8s] towards others and our Sinister\n[4441.1s] ulterior motives\n[4443.3s] may we Heavenly Father\n[4446.5s] be found as living examples of your\n[4449.2s] truth may we not keep the angels\n[4453.1s] on the outside\n[4454.6s] in books on buildings on papers\n[4458.9s] but may we allow them to come into our\n[4461.5s] hearts convict convert and may we now go\n[4465.2s] and share with others may we not eat the\n[4468.6s] leaven\n[4469.6s] of the apostates may we shun it and call\n[4473.1s] people to truth\n[4474.9s] may this place be a lighthouse\n[4477.6s] locally and internationally\n[4481.2s] now Lord we pray as we meet this new\n[4484.1s] week\n[4486.4s] Keep Us Faithful may we claim Matthew 6\n[4490.6s] give us this day our daily bread and may\n[4495.1s] we not doubt you will provide\n[4498.4s] Lord we love you\n[4500.1s] and we know you love us\n[4502.2s] may we grow to love you more reflect\n[4505.5s] your character more\n[4507.8s] we will face crises daily this week but\n[4511.7s] may we remember to claim your promises\n[4514.8s] put pep in our Step Prayer endurance\n[4518.2s] patience with a song to remove\n[4520.6s] discouragement\n[4522.5s] we thank you for hearing us prepare us\n[4525.0s] for tomorrow midday power surge wherein\n[4528.3s] We Begin the series\n[4530.7s] seven last days on

the more they would multiply the more is Chuck the Lesser his chances of succeeding is kingdom is always going down that is what he knew the Bible says exitingly Mighty and the land was filled with them foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign you see when I came to adventism adventism is my friends foreign we took our time to study because I knew he didn't uh but one thing religious is a system of Truth yes the Lord has given us all the treasures of Truth at our Command amen amen and the wife knows it but the problem was our people Adventists imagine imagine foreign foreign so the king of Egypt akasema how about and they are mightier than us in terms of strength yeah I have to reformers they are stronger than us okay skills commonly wisdom in fact the king of Babylon said go to the Hebrews foreign he knows the Bible says in verses number 10 come on let us deal wisely with them to attend a quake yes they multiply and it came to pass that when they are failing out any War they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land ing tonight foreign that is the plan of the devil the last days I was surprised wakati president and neutral conference president moja police you know how many president Macaulay into religious councils of Kenya akiyambia was a battle where thank you foreign and that is the exact thing that happened in the times when Jesus was being born again same here Moses the devil wanted to reduce the numbers of the people when Jesus was being born the same scenario was happening again so it shall be in the last days haha getting the point so that is where the world is God's people should stand on the platform of Eternal truth you see God will only protect his people as we do everything in our powers to obey every lies that God has himself only those who are living up to the right they have will receive additional light is now the Lord has laid in his word the exact part that you would want his people to follow the path of self-denight the path of righteousness and holiness and to the Lord is misery now wow after the ten place they had witnessed the power and the Providence of God had wrote miraculously in their behalf Anya maku they had seen the ten plagues fall in Egyptians it was the greatest miracles of all miracles they had seen the sea coming together and cover their enemies what are the Miracles what they do it and the Bible is specific in the Book of Micah chapter 6 verse 4 let us begin our discourse now Micah chapter 6 verses number four Micah we are reading some will call it Mika or Mica Micah chapter six amen amen Micah chapter six verse verse 4 the Bible says for I brought thee up out of the land of egyptia and redeemed thee out of the house of servantsima and I sent before thee one Moses two Aaron three Miriam atinami ni katum God is a god of order amen one of USI but I know it says some have advanced the thought that as we near the close of this arts history every child of God will work independently of any religious organization but I have been told that nothing of the list of such consistency shall be it will not work who are pressed together people should press together and have an organization for carrying forward God's work amen foreign uh right now we are dealing with how to organize God's work Where We Gather some one true God will leave us together we are trying to organize God's work in Nairobi we've organized God's work and I pray that also these sides and kakamega we also organize God's work Bitcoin organizations because alone we must organize God's work amen amen amen there were these three Messengers to help them to organize God's work because the three Messengers foreign foreign to help us organize God's work you see yeah and the past history of God's people those messages because all our Pioneers are together and they organize God's work in a systematic manner amen are we together so the history [Applause] the early hours the Ali are the beginnings of God's work s Alias 80 s that is our adventism and that is how Israel established Illinois says Jesus was the foundation of the Jewish economy amen yes hello yes they have to have Miriam so the first second and third Angels messages had to go before them now when adventism was being organized I'm sorry to say their foundations how the Lord and led them you see this quotation about there is nothing to fear for them for the future except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us and his teachings in our past history not not only see your village to establish the foundation of Israel The Ten Commandments the health message why don't you appoint others foreign are we together so Moses played the role Aaron played a role and Miriam also played a role in the establishment of the work and their Journey safariyao Kanan to the three Messengers foreign ERS the three messages the first second and third Angel's messages that God has given us to establish Us in the present truth 46 Exodus 24 15. to verses to The Last of Us the villain is 46. that is the same pattern when the Roman papacy was ruling 538 to 1798 the total of 60 period of Darkness spiritual Babylon that captivity foreign and then foreign that is John chapter 2 verse 19 amen yes for three days fast second and third Angels messages 1798 to 1844 46 years that is our foundation foundational truth of adventism should not be removed from those I saw somebody very high in the medical position man suggesting that the Timbers were laid longer haha Illinois says I Saw Three Steps one two three whoa and to anyone who shall remove D I saw some approaching the platform and they thought that the Timbers were later on adjusting that improvements would be made and be mentioned specifically in the same as somebody hi in the medical who was that yes the kind of crisis before I go back to AKA man so that is has has done what has sought to bring in the supposition that a great Reformation was to take place among Seventh-Day Adventists one SM two or four paragraphs and that this Reformation would consist in giving up the doctrines that stand as the pillars of our faith and engage in the process of re organization what is Reformation qualities things to take place go to the results the principles of truth that God in his wisdom has given to the remnant Church would be discarded our religion will be changed books of a new order will be a system of intellectual philosophy would be introduced a new organization would be established so clearly clear the steps that is why when Joshua Anna India because Moses did not did not participate in taking the children of Israel to Ghana's India because of the mistake and funny Moses Illinois says the Lord has showed me that the work of my husband is likened to Moses James White read the spiritual progress he was about them with the burden of the people [Music] James whites California Spalding and Madame collection you use such the work of my husband is likely to Moses James White did a lot in establishing the work at the beginning but guess what James White foreign but there were some issues which occurred later on in his ministry and that is why he used to be likened to Moses the pain of inspiration says that um stability but finally the work must progress God's people must go back you see even if Moses would strike the rock twice against God's will it does not mean that there are no faithful people still to carry forward God's word are we together yes when Illinois says let the Pioneer speak he knows she knows what she's saying because that history is very important but wait a minute Moses died the time to conquer the last enemies yes they had to be a fourth message apart from Moses hello Animalia goja to raise the fourth message to conquer now I've been interacting with many people the work of the fourth messenger first of all was to establish God's people in their Foundation experience in that's all foreign quiet look for the way marks us passing one by one look forward foreign [Music] [Music] eyes on the moon and that is what the Pioneers knew let us look at the remarks and let us be established in the truths that married as a people is let us not forget about the way much that is the autonomy chapter 31. [Music] now what your neighbor people how many years can you look at the content of their songs the contents none of them is singing our foundational truths you see the autonomy that one amen ities their song was specifically for their experience in their Journey the way the Lord had made it and his teachings in their past history that was the song God had designed the autonomy chapter number 30 [Music] verses number 19. the Bible says now therefore writing this who for you and teach it the children of Israel put it in their mouths that the soul may be a witness for me against the children of Israel I um foreign foreign [Music] corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you and evil will be for you in the latter days because he will do evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands and most respect in the ears of the congregation of Israel the words of the song until they were ended Musa foreign [Music] our foundational truth foreign they didn't understand his work we are going to conquer the last City to India they need to know the work of Nehemiah Nehemiah was given the fourth degree amen the first decree was given under King Darius the second degree to rebuild Jerusalem Babylon was given under King Cyrus Ezra 6 14. the third degree and the success the city of Jerusalem was built under three degrees to come in foreign [Music] I'm trying to bring these things to attention to establish so that when we move forward in unison in one mind Ezra chapter 6 verse 14. amen are we together the Bible says on the Elders of the Jews build it and they Prosper until one of you both through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of edothada foreign [Music] God of Israel and to the command Cyrus and Darius and after success king of pasia one tattoo okay this is the only decrease that were given and were used to complete the building no pretty hard the declare of Nehemiah the 40 degree are we together the days of the himaya and it will trouble us times [Music] the walls shall be revealed in Travelers times foreign [Music] [Music] foreign and Nairobi Tuesday to make a maternal Nairobi Town City Center Grove today we want to evangelize the cities [Music] there's no money but azima to Japan let your Travelers times we are leading our times foreign we should earnestly pray like the pioneers God will literally bring angels to provide for the means the exact money that he needed for that food so we should pray tomorrow I'm reading the statements of Illinois she says the Lord has his money in the hands of politicians Governors they have his money and if these people would approached well Karma Waters we pray and approach them is drugs so we want to establish a center of influence away from another cities we take the young people away from that place restoration and healing and we train them for the gospel Ministries God has really assisted us the correct sitting MCA or you're white so you pray with us I I don't know how I forgot that prayer request but we really want to yes just remember you pray with us also we need um thank you okay yes now you see Illinois says in the hands of politicians with Patrick and others because it 31 billion Shilling dinner to raise money for his campaigns videos [Music] we should not lack faith in these last days we should pray and act hour okay that is what we are doing this is and we explain to them the great controversy and the urgency of the work angels will come literally [Music] go to your government and very fast which might it might mean we pray first due to end God is interested in those who give their all to Father his work so we take heart and after college we just they just sit there you can share some little tips but uh be assured God has a lot of money in the hands is and it will surprise you those who shall bring in money to sustain God's work in the last days and that's what I'm working towards traveler's times the walls were being rebuilt okay Nehemiah is the fourth messenger just like Joshua and in the times of Joshua their crisis all of Israel has sinned against me they are not fit for the loud Cry of the Guardian they have seen the corporate here [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] at the second circumcision if the god of Israel is going to guide us to the final battle then we must understand him fully cowboy and the church adopted the Trinity God of Babylon watu wengi holy protest when the final Reformation of the first Angel's message is restoring back the worship of the true God God's people who are convicted in their hearts worry about what is they must accept baptism into the true worship of the Living God Joshua kasema watch anywhere foreign foreign thing for akan the son of karmi the son of zombie the son of Zera the tribe of Judah took the attached things and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel and Joshua sent men from Jericho to I ate Yeshua um which is besides but the heaven on the east side of better go up and view the country and the man went up and they returned to Joshua and said unto him let not all the people go up on let me jump to verse 5 and the man of ice molded them about 30 and six men for they chased them from before the gates foreign foreign and Joshua say the last oh Lord God wherefore verse 7. [Applause] the amorites to be destroyed by them unto God we had been content and dwell on the other side of Jordan oh Lord what shall I say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies what was the reason verse 10 the Lord said unto Joshua Yeshua get the up wherefore lies now that's upon thy face you know Israel Israel and they have also transgressed my Covenant which I commanded them for they have even taken off their casting I'm a Qatar neither will I be with you and I have also they have also stolen and dissembled also and they have put it even among their own staff you see total separation when God calls us to separate from sin and sinners he means it was do you see the formation is very great when the leaders of God's people the misery and to take even the education system of Egypt the end time reformers must restore every present Troop including education reform amen I think it scared the December church and state in our Uganda it's because of the education system of the state in the co-influenced the Roman purpose foreign they would find ways that means that is one of the reasons as to why organizations let the churches have their own School establish other churches and then sell them today what was the any idea chat School we have our church school yes we must do Reformation just bring it that is what people should understand you see akan had foreign [Music] foreign yes yes I will show the necessity of those who believe that they have the present true to be separate and distinct from those who are daily imbibing new heirs I saw that or old should attend their meetings or it was deadly and poisoned their souls that is why there is to be a total separation from Evil workers from sin from era guess what happened before I read this is yes it is under Joshua's Ministry that that that particular investigative judgment begins in the house of God every family must be investigated in the times of Joshua to fit them for the local families do you have any babylonious issues in your house what do you feel what do you watch foreign so that is why they have they have to be are an investigation of the families who profess the worship of the true God you know so only those who qualify this is we have a controversy with the leadership of admittism because they are not clear what part of Babylon is still alive they are not clear by the way are they clearly or not welcome clear no they are not clear you see Revelation 18 is a message that we should go to the world but first it must begin at home and that is what most Adventists will not accept Illinois says the work of these angels come in at the right time and joins in the voice of the third Angel to prepare God's people to start and thus God's people are prepared to stand in the hour of Temptation that is yes to come before them the work of this Angel this Angel the the message of the second Angel is repeated with the additional mention of the Corruptions that have been entering the various churches since 1844 so should we just speak of the Corruptions that were there then no we should continue with that I additional mental Corruptions infiltration additional mentions foreign foreign that was the mistake that is foreign [Music] only those who are the worshipers of the true God [Music] that is and that is why the true messages they can never be found in the leadership of all these people in this business foreign and the Catholic Bishops to bring them on board what part of Babylon is still alive is it fallen or there is some part which is still alive so the corporate Adventist is not sure whether Babylon is falling in short s [Music] to be honest and I say Ma I'm reading the last thoughts as we bring this to a close doesn't matter what God wants when I read this first in pamphlets ph081s now th is which these are publics yes yeah these are complexes zero eighty one I think it's series number eight one page that seven I read the paragraph two [Music] let me begin from paragraph one it says the early reformers amen this is a common quotation right this is the early reformers realized that they could not hope to succeed if their children were educated by the Roman Catholic teachers it requires faith and he was about to live I was also one of them are we a reformers children are being educated it's very sad the early reformers realized that they could not hope to succeed if their children were educated by the Roman Catholic teachers Luther says that the Bible must be studied teachers must be provided schools must be established he felt that to strengthen their information it was a requisite to work on the young to improve schools amen let us work on them let's put our energy our that is what we are told and to propagate through Christiano the knowledge necessary for the profound study of the Holy scriptures this accordingly was one of the objects of his life he saw it in particular at the period which we have reached and wrote the councilors of all the cities of Germany calling on them to found Christian Schools amen the early reformers found it necessary to have their own causes of study textbooks teachers methods principles Etc they separated themselves completely from the popular schools of the day it required courage and faith in those days to take such a stand and it will require even more courage and Faith for those who are preparing for translation to take the stand which the testimonies are pleading for them to take they knew that if their children should go to the schools where the popular education was given they would receive the mark of the beasts those who are leading up to the light at the present time will see even more clearly that if their children continue to go to these popular schools They will receive such principles as will compare them to assist in giving life to the image of the beasts anyone who has a knowledge of the third Angel's message and who will take the trouble to examine this and studies the methods of the popular systems of Education can see that the books are filled with those eras which will oblite those who are receiving their education from them to take the Dreadful step which will bring upon the world are religious and civil Darkness greater than has ever been known before as we continue to work on our information to establish of the present truth of the first second third Angel's message we should never forget of our children let us pray that God will open doors for us to establish our church school so that our children may be trained and taught by our own may the Lord bless us in Jesus name the way Max I don't know which number it was but five minutes look for the women's so brother it's here this idea we sing it unitedly then we'll

problem was our people\n[942.2s] Adventists imagine imagine\n[948.8s] foreign\n[982.3s] foreign\n[984.4s] so\n[985.8s] the king of Egypt\n[988.3s] akasema how about and they are mightier\n[992.0s] than us\n[994.4s] in terms of strength yeah I have to\n[998.1s] reformers they are stronger than us\n[1001.0s] okay\n[1004.8s] skills commonly wisdom\n[1008.9s] in fact the king of Babylon said go to\n[1011.7s] the Hebrews\n[1016.2s] foreign\n[1048.5s] he knows\n[1049.9s] the Bible says in verses number 10 come\n[1052.4s] on\n[1057.2s] let us deal wisely with them to attend a\n[1060.7s] quake\n[1061.9s] yes\n[1070.2s] they multiply and it came to pass that\n[1074.6s] when they are failing out any War\n[1078.3s] they join also unto our enemies and\n[1080.8s] fight against us and so get them up out\n[1083.9s] of the land\n[1090.1s] ing\n[1093.6s] tonight\n[1104.5s] foreign\n[1107.6s] that is the plan of the devil the last\n[1109.9s] days\n[1112.0s] I was surprised\n[1116.1s] wakati\n[1118.0s] president and neutral conference\n[1120.0s] president moja police you know how many\n[1121.9s] president Macaulay\n[1130.5s] into religious councils of Kenya\n[1133.8s] akiyambia was a battle where\n[1141.7s] thank you foreign\n[1167.7s] and that is the exact thing that\n[1169.6s] happened in the times when Jesus was\n[1172.3s] being born again\n[1174.0s] same here Moses\n[1178.3s] the devil wanted to reduce the numbers\n[1180.2s] of the people\n[1181.6s] when Jesus was being born the same\n[1183.5s] scenario was happening again\n[1192.9s] so it shall be in the last days\n[1208.0s] haha\n[1209.8s] getting the point so that is where the\n[1212.3s] world is\n[1222.6s] God's people should stand on the\n[1225.5s] platform of Eternal truth you see God\n[1227.9s] will only protect his people as we do\n[1229.9s] everything in our powers\n[1231.8s] to obey every lies that God has\n[1234.6s] himself\n[1247.1s] only those who are living up to the\n[1249.5s] right

advanced\n[1437.5s] the thought\n[1438.5s] that as we near the close of this arts\n[1440.9s] history every child of God will work\n[1443.9s] independently of any religious\n[1446.3s] organization\n[1447.9s] but I have been told that nothing of the\n[1451.5s] list of such consistency shall be it\n[1454.6s] will not work\n[1456.3s] who are pressed together\n[1458.7s] people should press together and have an\n[1462.3s] organization for carrying forward God's\n[1464.7s] work amen\n[1466.1s] foreign\n[1472.1s] uh right now we are dealing with how to\n[1475.0s] organize God's work\n[1478.1s] Where We Gather some\n[1480.6s] one true God will leave us together we\n[1483.0s] are trying to organize God's work\n[1484.9s] in Nairobi we've organized God's work\n[1487.0s] and I pray that also these sides and\n[1489.3s] kakamega we also organize God's work\n[1491.9s] Bitcoin organizations because\n[1500.0s] alone\n[1505.2s] we must organize God's work amen\n[1507.9s] amen\n[1522.2s] amen there were these three Messengers\n[1524.5s] to help them to organize God's work\n[1526.9s] because the three Messengers\n[1534.6s] foreign\n[1535.8s] foreign\n[1549.3s] to help us organize God's work\n[1552.9s] you see yeah\n[1555.9s] and the past history of God's people\n[1558.8s] those messages\n[1565.7s] because all our Pioneers are together\n[1567.9s] and they organize God's work in a\n[1570.4s] systematic manner amen\n[1572.6s] are we together so the history\n[1576.1s] [Applause]\n[1581.0s] the early hours the Ali are the\n[1584.2s] beginnings of God's work\n[1587.6s] s Alias 80 s\n[1590.8s] that is our adventism\n[1593.6s] and that is how Israel established\n[1597.9s] Illinois says Jesus was the foundation\n[1601.2s] of the Jewish economy\n[1603.7s] amen yes\n[1612.2s] hello\n[1620.6s] yes they have to have Miriam\n[1624.8s] so the first second and third Angels\n[1627.9s] messages had to go before them now\n[1632.5s] when adventism was being organized I'm\n[1635.9s] sorry to say\n[1639.4s] their foundations how the Lord and led\n[1643.1s] them\n[1644.7s] you see this quotation about\n[1647.0s] there is nothing to fear for them\n[1650.4s] for the future except\n[1652.7s] as we shall forget\n[1654.9s] the way the Lord has led us and his\n[1658.7s] teachings in\n[1661.2s] our past history\n[1663.7s] not not only see your village\n[1676.6s] to establish the foundation of Israel\n[1682.6s] The Ten Commandments the\n[1687.0s] health message\n[1694.2s] why don't you appoint others foreign\n[1703.4s] are we together so Moses played the role\n[1706.7s] Aaron played a role\n[1709.1s] and Miriam also played a role in the\n[1711.5s] establishment of the work and their\n[1713.1s] Journey safariyao\n[1717.6s] Kanan\n[1726.7s] to the three Messengers\n[1730.0s] foreign\n[1739.9s] ERS the three messages\n[1742.2s] the first second and third Angel's\n[1744.1s] messages\n[1746.8s] that God has given us to establish Us in\n[1751.1s] the present truth\n[1760.0s] 46 Exodus 24 15.\n[1765.1s] to verses to The Last of Us the villain\n[1767.5s] is\n[1778.6s] 46.\n[1784.0s] that is the same pattern\n[1787.6s] when the Roman papacy was ruling 538 to\n[1791.7s] 1798 the total of 60 period of Darkness\n[1797.5s] spiritual Babylon\n[1799.9s] that captivity foreign\n[1830.4s] and then foreign\n[1844.2s] that is John chapter 2 verse 19 amen\n[1852.7s] yes\n[1856.2s] for three days fast\n[1858.8s] second and third Angels messages 1798\n[1863.8s] to 1844 46 years that is our foundation\n[1869.8s] foundational truth of adventism\n[1878.7s] should not be removed from those\n[1882.4s] I saw somebody very high in the medical\n[1887.8s] position man\n[1889.8s] suggesting that the Timbers were laid\n[1891.9s] longer\n[1892.9s] haha Illinois says I Saw Three Steps one\n[1897.6s] two three\n[1899.5s] whoa and to anyone who shall remove\n[1907.3s] D I saw some approaching the platform\n[1909.3s] and they thought that the Timbers were\n[1911.9s] later on\n[1914.0s] adjusting that improvements would be\n[1915.9s] made\n[1917.3s] and be mentioned specifically in the\n[1919.0s] same as somebody hi in the medical\n[1922.7s] who was that\n[1925.1s] yes the kind of crisis\n[1928.8s] before I go back to AKA man\n[1932.4s] so that is\n[1943.7s] has has done what\n[1946.6s] has sought to bring in the supposition\n[1948.7s] that a great Reformation was to take\n[1951.5s] place among Seventh-Day Adventists one\n[1953.9s] SM two or four paragraphs and that this\n[1957.0s] Reformation would consist in giving up\n[1959.4s] the doctrines that stand as the pillars\n[1961.9s] of our faith and engage in the process\n[1964.8s] of re\n[1965.9s] organization what is\n[1972.4s] Reformation qualities things to take\n[1975.4s] place go to the results the principles\n[1977.9s] of truth that God in his wisdom has\n[1980.1s] given to the remnant Church would be\n[1981.7s] discarded\n[1983.5s] our religion will be changed\n[1986.5s] books of a new order will be\n[1991.6s] a system of intellectual philosophy\n[1994.0s] would be introduced\n[1996.4s] a new organization\n[1999.0s] would be established\n[2001.5s] so clearly clear the steps that is why\n[2005.4s] when Joshua Anna India because Moses did\n[2009.8s] not did not participate in taking the\n[2013.0s] children of Israel to Ghana's India\n[2014.9s] because of the mistake and funny\n[2017.9s] Moses\n[2020.3s] Illinois says the Lord has showed me\n[2022.5s] that the work of my husband is likened\n[2024.6s] to Moses\n[2026.4s] James White\n[2028.3s] read the spiritual progress he was about\n[2030.3s] them with the burden of the people\n[2034.4s] [Music]\n[2038.0s] James whites California\n[2041.7s] Spalding and Madame collection you use\n[2044.0s] such the work of my husband is likely to\n[2046.9s] Moses\n[2049.6s] James White did a lot in establishing\n[2052.1s] the work at the beginning\n[2053.6s] but guess what\n[2058.6s] James White\n[2061.1s] foreign\n[2067.3s] but there were some issues which\n[2068.9s] occurred later on in his ministry\n[2071.9s] and that is why he used to be likened to\n[2073.8s] Moses\n[2075.8s] the pain of inspiration says that\n[2079.1s] um\n[2081.3s] stability\n[2086.1s] but\n[2088.2s] finally\n[2089.9s] the work must progress\n[2092.6s] God's people must go back you see even\n[2095.3s] if Moses would strike the rock twice\n[2098.4s] against God's will it does not mean that\n[2101.8s] there are no faithful people still to\n[2104.1s] carry forward God's word\n[2113.8s] are we together\n[2115.2s] yes\n[2116.6s] when Illinois says let the Pioneer speak\n[2119.1s] he knows she knows what she's saying\n[2123.4s] because that history is very important\n[2125.7s] but wait a minute\n[2128.8s] Moses died\n[2133.3s] the time to conquer the last enemies\n[2149.1s] yes they had to be a fourth message\n[2152.4s] apart from\n[2153.9s]

up\n[3521.5s] wherefore lies now that's upon thy face\n[3526.1s] you know\n[3528.0s] Israel\n[3531.7s] Israel\n[3534.1s] and they have also transgressed my\n[3537.6s] Covenant which I commanded them for they\n[3539.7s] have even taken off their casting\n[3549.3s] I'm a Qatar\n[3551.0s] neither will I be with you\n[3554.1s] and I have also they have also stolen\n[3556.4s] and dissembled also and they have put it\n[3560.0s] even among their own staff\n[3570.2s] you see total separation when God calls\n[3572.8s] us to separate from sin and sinners\n[3576.4s] he means it\n[3579.9s] was\n[3584.8s] do you see the formation is very great\n[3590.3s] when the leaders of God's people\n[3595.3s] the misery\n[3598.6s] and to take even the education system\n[3601.7s] of Egypt\n[3603.9s] the end time reformers must restore\n[3606.7s] every present Troop including\n[3611.6s] education reform\n[3614.5s] amen\n[3623.7s] I think it scared the December\n[3627.1s] church and state\n[3630.4s] in our Uganda\n[3634.6s] it's because of the education system of\n[3637.2s] the state\n[3639.0s] in the co-influenced the Roman purpose\n[3646.4s] foreign\n[3652.1s] they would find ways that means that is\n[3655.0s] one of the reasons as to why\n[3657.6s] organizations\n[3660.4s] let the churches have their own School\n[3670.4s] establish other churches and then sell\n[3672.7s] them today what was the any idea\n[3679.9s] chat School\n[3683.2s] we have our church school\n[3685.7s] yes\n[3687.2s] we must do Reformation\n[3695.7s] just bring it\n[3697.1s] that is what people should understand\n[3709.0s] you see akan had foreign\n[3723.3s] [Music]\n[3740.3s] foreign\n[3745.0s] yes\n[3748.4s] yes I will show the necessity of those\n[3750.2s] who believe that they have the present\n[3752.3s] true to be separate and distinct from\n[3755.1s] those who are daily imbibing new heirs\n[3760.9s] I saw that\n[3762.5s] or old should attend their meetings or\n[3766.4s] it was deadly and poisoned their souls\n[3779.9s] that is why there is to be a total\n[3783.1s] separation\n[3785.0s] from Evil workers from sin from era\n[3797.2s] guess what happened before I read this\n[3800.6s] is\n[3805.7s] yes it is under Joshua's Ministry\n[3809.7s] that that that particular investigative\n[3812.4s] judgment begins in the house of God\n[3816.6s] every family must be investigated in the\n[3820.4s] times of Joshua\n[3822.4s] to fit them for the local families\n[3830.4s] do you have any babylonious issues in\n[3833.6s] your house\n[3836.4s] what do you feel\n[3839.0s] what do you watch\n[3840.7s] foreign\n[3872.3s] so that is why they have they have to be\n[3875.2s] are\n[3876.2s] an investigation\n[3878.3s] of the families who profess the worship\n[3881.7s] of the true God\n[3883.6s] you know\n[3886.0s] so only those who qualify\n[3892.0s] this is\n[3898.6s] we have a controversy with the\n[3902.0s] leadership of admittism because they are\n[3904.7s] not clear what part of Babylon is still\n[3906.8s] alive they are not clear by the way are\n[3908.9s] they clearly or not\n[3911.3s] welcome clear\n[3913.0s] no they are not clear\n[3917.2s] you see Revelation 18 is a message that\n[3920.7s] we should go to the world but first it\n[3922.8s] must begin at home\n[3924.4s] and that is what most Adventists will\n[3926.2s] not accept\n[3928.3s] Illinois says the work of these angels\n[3931.0s] come in at the right time\n[3933.8s] and joins in the voice of the third\n[3937.7s] Angel to prepare God's people to start\n[3940.4s] and thus God's people are prepared to\n[3942.2s] stand in the hour of Temptation\n[3944.6s] that is yes to come before them\n[3950.3s] the work of this Angel this Angel the\n[3953.6s] the message of the second Angel is\n[3956.5s] repeated with\n[3958.7s] the additional mention of the\n[3962.2s] Corruptions that have been entering the\n[3964.9s] various\n[3966.6s] churches since\n[3969.0s] 1844 so\n[3974.5s] should we just speak of the Corruptions\n[3976.8s] that were there then\n[3978.4s] no we should continue with that I\n[3981.2s] additional mental\n[3984.2s] Corruptions\n[3992.8s] infiltration\n[4001.7s] additional mentions\n[4004.5s] foreign\n[4012.4s] foreign\n[4039.9s] that was the mistake\n[4042.2s] that is\n[4050.8s] foreign\n[4056.2s] [Music]\n[4065.2s] only those who are the worshipers of the\n[4067.9s] true God\n[4068.5s] [Music]\n[4075.3s] that is\n[4076.9s] and that is why the true messages\n[4080.5s] they can never be found in the\n[4082.7s] leadership of all these people in this\n[4084.2s] business\n[4085.3s] foreign\n[4114.1s] and the Catholic Bishops to bring them\n[4116.5s] on board what part of Babylon is still\n[4118.9s] alive\n[4120.0s] is it fallen or there is some part which\n[4122.7s] is still alive\n[4125.5s] so the corporate Adventist is not sure\n[4128.1s] whether Babylon is falling in

matter what God wants when I\n[4174.3s] read this first\n[4176.1s] in pamphlets ph081s\n[4180.9s] now th is which these are publics\n[4183.8s] yes\n[4185.2s] yeah these are complexes\n[4187.8s] zero eighty one I think it's series\n[4189.5s] number eight one page that seven\n[4191.7s] I read the paragraph two\n[4196.2s] [Music]\n[4197.4s] let me begin from paragraph one it says\n[4200.3s] the early reformers amen\n[4203.2s] this is a common quotation\n[4207.2s] right this is\n[4213.0s] the early reformers\n[4215.7s] realized\n[4219.4s] that they could not hope to succeed\n[4222.1s] if their children were educated by the\n[4224.2s] Roman Catholic teachers\n[4232.7s] it requires faith\n[4235.3s] and he was about to live\n[4238.9s] I was also one of them\n[4242.2s] are we a reformers\n[4245.3s] children are being educated\n[4249.7s] it's very sad\n[4251.4s] the early reformers realized that they\n[4254.4s] could not hope to succeed if their\n[4256.0s] children were educated by the Roman\n[4257.5s] Catholic teachers\n[4259.3s] Luther says\n[4261.1s] that the Bible must be studied teachers\n[4264.0s] must be provided schools must be\n[4266.4s] established he felt that to strengthen\n[4269.7s] their information it was a requisite to\n[4273.0s] work on the young to improve schools\n[4275.6s] amen\n[4284.6s] let us work on them\n[4287.0s] let's put our energy our\n[4289.6s] that is what we are told\n[4292.6s] and to propagate through Christiano the\n[4295.2s] knowledge necessary for the profound\n[4296.8s] study of the Holy scriptures\n[4298.9s] this accordingly was one of the objects\n[4302.1s] of his life he saw it in particular at\n[4305.2s] the period which we have reached and\n[4307.9s] wrote the councilors of all the cities\n[4309.9s] of Germany calling on them to found\n[4312.7s] Christian Schools amen the early\n[4316.6s] reformers found it necessary to have\n[4318.3s] their own causes of study textbooks\n[4321.0s] teachers methods principles Etc they\n[4325.7s] separated themselves completely from the\n[4327.9s] popular schools of the day it required\n[4330.6s] courage and faith in those days to take\n[4333.7s] such a stand and it will require even\n[4336.8s] more courage and Faith for those who are\n[4339.7s] preparing for translation to take the\n[4342.6s] stand which the testimonies are pleading\n[4345.5s] for them to take\n[4347.5s] they knew that if their children should\n[4351.3s] go to the schools where the popular\n[4353.4s] education was given they would receive\n[4355.9s] the mark of the beasts\n[4359.1s] those who are leading up to the light at\n[4361.3s] the present time will see even more\n[4363.9s] clearly that if their children continue\n[4366.0s] to go to these popular schools They will\n[4368.7s] receive such principles as will compare\n[4371.4s] them to assist in giving life to the\n[4374.1s] image of the beasts anyone who has a\n[4376.9s] knowledge of the third Angel's message\n[4378.3s] and who will take the trouble to examine\n[4380.9s] this and studies\n[4382.8s] the methods of the popular systems of\n[4385.6s] Education can see that the books are\n[4389.4s] filled with those eras which will oblite\n[4392.7s] those who are receiving their education\n[4394.9s] from them to take the Dreadful step\n[4397.9s] which will bring upon the world are\n[4400.6s] religious\n[4401.8s] and civil Darkness greater than has ever\n[4405.3s] been known before\n[4412.2s] as we continue to work on our\n[4413.8s] information to establish of the present\n[4416.3s] truth of the first second third Angel's\n[4418.0s] message we should never forget of our\n[4420.3s] children let us pray that God will open\n[4422.6s] doors for us to establish our church\n[4425.1s] school\n[4426.0s] so that our children may be trained and\n[4429.4s] taught by our own\n[4432.9s] may the Lord bless us in Jesus name\n[4443.5s] the way Max\n[4446.1s] I don't know which number it was

Satan to rule the world through the New World Order final attempt to overthrow the kingdom of God and to set up the mark of the beast the Bible says in Revelation 17: number 12 concerning the New World Order it is written and the 10 horns which thou swest are 10 Kings which have received no Kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with the Beast these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast this shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings the Bible shows the final agenda but Jesus will reign supreme many people do not understand where the world is heading Bible prophecies clear Satan had an agenda in heaven before he was thrown out of Heaven he had five strategic plans which he had suggested and the angels of heaven were deceived a third of them who fell together with him the Bible says in Isaiah chapter number 14 and vers number 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did is weaken the Nations the nations are weakened for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend unto Heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sights of the north I will Ascend above the highs of the clouds and finally he said I I will be like the most high so if the church and the Christians who are true to the Bible and the scriptures and the voice of God will be quiet then the stones will pick it up from there we have done our part the United Nations has set Vision 2030 everyone is watching some are not clear of what is going to happen the nations of the Earth are being taken captives the religious world is silent take a listen to what is happening to the nations of the earth including our own country Kenya I want you to listen to what the stones are saying these may not be necessarily Christians but these are faithful citizens of this country listen to what they saying and then we'll come back fellow Kenyans uh Steve mooa now basically I just wanted to touch on few issues uh um I'm one person who believes that you can never find a solution to any problem you're going through as a country if you don't understand the root cause of these problems now you'll agree with me that uh the entire country is in shambles in terms of people's emotions and uh the feelings you know people feel betrayed people feel uh the cost of living is gone up you know they were promised so much and they're not getting anything and it's it's very important for Kenyans to understand what is really happening in this country uh without doubt and fear of contradiction I'll tell you that the entire Kenyan systems from the political to the economic I'll say even probably the social uh systems have been taken over by the globalists today as we speak the globalists control our entire political system policy systems and the economic systems when I talk of the globalist I'm talking of the IMF I'm talking of the World Bank I'm talking of the world economic forum and we have to understand what these people are and what their intentions are in the long run now I'll take you briefly uh towards the history so that you understand where I'm coming from remember all these people work through serious organizations like the United Nations the United Nations was created immediately after the second world war that was in 1946 in the 13th of February 1946 the United Nations formulated a document called the United Nations Charter in the charter it states clearly that its key objective is to break down the sovereign ities of countries and create a one world government that is very clear and as I've said I'm not here to propagate anything this is information that is out there go to the net go to the web look for the United Nation chter and you'll find this information it states it's it states down everything all the regulations all all all all all all the advantages that the UN will have which is their agenda now during the that time with this big agenda and remember even before the second world war the great leaders for example the likes of uh the likes of Hitler the likes of Stalin they all had the similar objective of controlling the whole world but they failed because with them they resulted to using Force which didn't work now after the formulation of the UN these organizations were were run by a group of cabals or bosses or globalists known as the build thebad Group which later on changed its name in 1971 to the world economic Forum now led by a German Economist called Cloud show up later on during this period the world was experiencing what to call the Cold War so immediately the Cold War ended in 1991 the club of Rome started accelerating this idea of the new world order or the world world uh One World Government remember it is even evident they did a book there's a book called the first Global Revolution if you have time go online look for that book read that book that book States clearly that the biggest enemy of the world is Humanity itself in 1992 more than 166 country countries met under the UN and signed and agreed that the biggest problem the world is experiencing is overpopulation and that they should create and formulate ways on how to depopulate the world and I'm telling you Kenyans this is information that is out there you can go out there research read and get to understand the acceleration started and they formulated a document under the world economic Forum if you read if you go and read about the world economic Forum this is an umbrella of the globalist the rich people of the world they meet in a place called Davos every year in Switzerland and they decide the way forward you know this year we'll invest in this we'll put these laws we'll put this formulate this policies in these countries and so forth create this and create that destabilize this and stabilize that that is they they they they are in quotes the bosses of the world to me I believe you're all equal but that's their mentality which they have a right to believe the what whatever they believe in their strategy of depopulation and control in order to create the One World Government they picked on few issues to tackle number one the basic thing to do to control Mankind and also to depopulate mankind is control the food you control the food you control Humanity so they've been putting in place enforcing leaders whom they control in all these countries to create policies that at the end of the day will frustrate the citizens will create food shortages and will end up creating hunger starvation hence depopulation will be there either in the form of malnutrition or lack of food and these things are coming I'm not joking you want to take it for granted it's up to you since no leader is talking about this since no leader understands what's going on I have taken this mantle to talk to Kenyans so that let us discuss the real issues let us discuss what is ailing this country if we can solve that problem I'm telling you our problem is not money our problem is not economy those are things we can solve we've done it before kibaki did it before without help from anyone we have best brains in this country but we have to understand that our president has been held captive and it did not start with Ruto if you look at all these policies all these policies the implementations started during uru time I was in odm I was an neck member and I'll tell you 101% and any neck member including R oinga himself will confirm I am the only person who left and told them there's a game being played and I guaranteed and even if you go to our walls before they remove me from the group go to the walls of the neck my last message was we will go to elections in the next two years and uru will never take Raa to gay live alone Mount Kenya as much as uru does not like rut he had no option these were conditions given to him and they knew they cannot control R odinga that's why he had to pass the mantle to Ruto let no one lie to you they might have their own personal differences they don't like each other but they they all are were and are controlled by the same system that that one you can take it to the bank now I'll speak of the few things that we've seen in this country that are being formulated after told you the New World Order agenda aims to control the whole world by creating a One World Government when I talk of a One World Government I'm talking of one government one president one Army one Judicial System you know and it trickles down for them to do that they came with a formulation document number one control the food number two identity and that's when they came with the new idea of the digital identity through the help of it so that they can be able to control and know each and every movement of each and every person on Earth these things are real these things are coming now let me let let me touch on let me touch on food how how how how are they going to do it it's through formulation of policies they came up with the agenda of climate change what does climate change has to do with agriculture number one with the climate change formulation policy it says agriculture in itself is what is creating the changes in climate number one they're bringing in restrictions on nitrogen fertilizers number two we have seen in Kenya here even from kinu time when he formulated what we call the strategy document when he was the minister today it is illegal to share seeds so even organic seeds if I'm to give my neighbor for him to plant in his 100 acres it is illegal we created policies to allow foreign companies to come and patent their seeds here which you're not supposed to buy from anyone else apart from them and Mark you majority of these seeds are genetically modified seeds which number one are very expensive to buy Al there you go on Google Kenyans just check the price of tomato seeds GMO tomato seeds the cheapest you'll get is about 10 million Shillings per kilo the best quality is about 50 60 million Shillings a kilo of tomato seeds so what does that mean if you're forcing me to buy these seeds as a normal farmer and I can't afford 10 million what what is the next thing I'll do I'll abandon farming and that's what is happening they brought in laws on on on uh potato Farmers they brought in funny funny laws on farming just to break down the farmers and ensure you're no longer in the industry same as livestock farming what does the climate change policy say on climate far uh livestock farming it says livestock farming releases um greenhouse gases which release nitrogen in the air hence affect the climate so they're saying now you have to register if you have cows if you have cattle if you have poultry and if you don't there are Hefty fines up to millions of shillings to scare you all these things are done by Design because they want to control the food remember I have told you in the world economic Forum in the New World Order agenda they St very well that the idea is no one should own anything the entire land the entire farming should be owned by the corporations so my friend when you're busy talking about this housing project housing project the housing projects is a must for rut to do them because he's been told he must do them simply because in the two next few years there's no farmer who will be able to farm in this country and the next thing they'll do they'll give you offers they'll offer you money for your farm once you hand over your farm they'll give you an offer they'll tell you by the way we have an apartment which you can get at a better price you've heard words even from the president himself where he says I think it is time people should leave rural areas and come to urban areas we need to free up space for farming free up space for farming you know some words like building back better you know building back better go on YouTube just type build back better go on Twitter build back better you'll see the people who mention that word and what they say they're all aligned to this agenda they call them sustainable development goals it's not sustainable my friend all they want is total control I will tell you as a Kenyan as a patriot someone who cannot be bought and it's sad no leader is seeing the angle in which this thing is being uh directed so my friends stop asking about the housing projects and all that all those houses are meant for all those who will lose their land that's why there's no structure that's why even the mes that's why even the the Attorney General comes and says he knew nothing about this housing thing you know because it is above his level it is being done by the cabals and it is through policies MPS please I know how they control you but please before you amend and pass these bills read them read them when you go to the United Nations Charter most of the countries in the world have even signed that they're going to surrender 30% of the land to the UN for the purpose of Conservancy to preserve climate today in Kenya laws are coming you know read laws are coming to give the Government powers for compulsory acquisition of land you know they come to kitui and say now the entire kitu we need to do some Conservancy here so you people have to leave compulsory acquisition and you're offering 10 Shillings per acre or 10 million per acre or 1 million or or or or three you know it's government my friend so these things are there and it's the UN saying it they're giving them the the way forward the the path is being created by them now once you control the food it means hunger will come people will be frustrated you've controlled the food number two control their economy frustrate them economically look at this country for the last 10 years when did you hear when did you last hear of a success story there's a businessman who started a business and is doing well you can't do well because the system have been made to break us completely who formulated the law that you can't withdraw 1 million or or deposit more than 1 million Shillings when Ruto was campaigning he said he will make sure he opens up that LW why has it not changed why is it the one who was in charge of Treasury during uhuru's time and the one who was in charge of of of of Central Bank why is it the same people who we sa and cast them that they've brought down our economy why is it that when Ruto came in they didn't bring in new people they just SWA them to went the other side and Jog went to the other side there only two reasons why you'll do that number one it's either to control information or number two to continue doing what they were doing which we I you and I know is breaking the system number three now once you create all these people die of stress you know many people look at look at the the the mental cases going on in the country look at look at the diseases look look at the pressure people are going through economically people are frustrated people are you know it's like people are going crazy now you cannot even Farm there's no food there's nothing what next now that we we've started dealing with the numbers we now need to control them how do we control them we control them through the digital ID remember very soon this entire economic system the dollar system the world Reserve System is going to collapse there's going to be an introduction of the new cbdc they called the Central Bank digital currencies we are all going digital it's like the Bitcoins you know and the digital currency will be attached to your digital identity so my friend you break the rules like you say things against the government for example what I'm saying you can't use your digital currency anywhere you go to a shop to buy skuma you're told so you understand what I mean you know you can't travel you can't move you're told you can't leave Nairobi out of Nairobi my friend your your digital currency cannot work so you cannot survive so those are the things that are coming and how will they do it it's very simple how do you do it you create chaos how do you create chaos to make people adapt the the digital ID because some countries people will Rebel so what do you do open the borders free Visa open the borders because you know the moment I open the Border all that will come in in an expectation in a year or so chaos will erupt then the government now will come as a Good Samaritan and tell you oh please uh because there's so much crime in this country we now need compulsory acquisition of digital IDs to everyone so that we can know each and everyone and my friends you will get that digital ID and once you get that digital ID you are in jail slavery is coming back and this is real I'm saying it from the bottom of my heart and I'm saying I'm not propagating anything this is is information that is out there go read about the Davos agenda go read about the world economic Forum go read about the New World Order go read about the UN Charter and you'll understand where we are heading to that is what is happening my friends that is what is happening not once not twice not Thrice your president himself he's told even his leaders I watched when they had the the PG at state house he said my hands are tied now he's the senior most civil servant in the country he's the boss who else can tie his hand and he's the boss of all bosses in this country it is the globalists and they've taken over and I think he needs help I think he needs help you know we should not just we should not just uh Ambush him I think that man is suffering and he needs help because it's a point of no return today you've seen yesterday they were in Uganda R is opting out and remember the last one of the last interviews Raa did he said I've realized it's not true to who stole my elections my elections were stolen by some people who have interests now it's me telling you because they're always scared to say they're always scared to mention those names because the few leaders who mentioned you know you know you know the story of our neighboring presidents who died finally you know you go yeah we know them you know them you go against them they they deal with you anyway people like us personally I'm not scared of anything the worst thing in life is there's there's one old man who told me the richest place on Earth is the grave because beneath the grave lies so many ideas lies so many eye openers that did not utilize the time when they were alive so I decide to use this time just to talk to to my fellow Kenyans the worst thing is when our kids will grow up and find such we live a beautiful country like this where our forefathers died poured blood for us to have this slavery this beautiful country and we leaving it to the dogs you know it's it's so sad you know when our kids will be asking us daddy mommy where were you when all this was happening we have to start speaking now the media focus on the right issues the media don't be scared what we are saying is let us talk about the fundamental let's Cascade down to the roots and know the real causes of our problems and that's when we'll find a solution the few leaders who've been there and been been trying I want to to to to appla one ok omata but you seem not to to recognize him you know because he's a nobody we are meant to believe that in opposition it is so and so he supposed to talk and so and so he supposed to talk my friend hey every Kenyan has something to say even a beggar on the road can save your life information is power and knowledge is king So Kenyans I urge you and the media from today start researching start reading about all these agenda the New World Order agenda the agenda 2030 the world economic Forum read about the UN Charter read about the globalist agenda and you'll understand what is happening in Kenya it's the same thing that has been happening all over today for the whole of last two weeks you've seen farmers in Germany in Spain in Holland they were all demonstrating why were they demonstrating because of similar policies land is being taken from them now it's being owned by the globalists they said policies where they snatch the land from them and that is what is coming in this country it is coming so are you ready the question is are you ready anyway if there's any leader any person who disputes what I'm saying I'm ready call me for an interview anywhere CNN BBC Al jaaz K call me one onone two on two even the president himself I'm ready to sit with you challenge me I challenge you I'm doing this for Kenya Kenya is my business and my business is Kenya thank you Kenyans Kaz",

to the\n[11.7s] scriptures the final agenda of Satan to\n[14.8s] rule the world through the New World\n[17.0s] Order final attempt to overthrow the\n[19.4s] kingdom of God and to set up the mark of\n[22.2s] the beast the Bible says in Revelation\n[25.1s] 17: number\n[27.0s] 12 concerning the New World Order it is\n[30.4s] written and the 10 horns which thou\n[32.8s] swest are 10 Kings which have received\n[36.1s] no Kingdom as yet but receive power as\n[40.8s] kings one hour with the\n[43.4s] Beast these have one mind and shall give\n[46.6s] their power and strength unto the\n[50.7s] Beast this shall make war with the lamb\n[53.4s] and the lamb shall overcome them for he\n[55.4s] is Lord of lords and King of Kings the\n[58.0s] Bible shows the final agenda\n[61.0s] but Jesus will reign\n[63.9s] supreme many people do not understand\n[66.8s] where the world is heading Bible\n[68.5s] prophecies clear Satan had an agenda in\n[71.3s] heaven before he was thrown out of\n[75.2s] Heaven he had five strategic\n[78.3s] plans which he had suggested and the\n[81.1s] angels of heaven were deceived a third\n[83.2s] of them who fell together with him the\n[87.4s] Bible says in Isaiah chapter number 14\n[89.7s] and vers number 12 how art thou fallen\n[93.1s] from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the\n[95.0s] morning how art thou cut down to the\n[97.7s] ground which did is weaken the Nations\n[100.2s] the nations are\n[101.7s] weakened for thou Hast said in thine\n[104.1s] heart I will Ascend unto Heaven I will\n[107.7s] exalt my throne above the stars of God I\n[111.0s] will sit upon the Mount of the\n[112.7s] congregation in the sights of the north\n[115.2s] I will Ascend above the highs of the\n[117.5s] clouds and finally he said I I will be\n[121.1s] like the most\n[122.8s] high\n[124.4s] so if the church and the Christians who\n[127.6s] are true to the Bible and the scriptures\n[129.8s] and the voice of God will be quiet then\n[132.9s] the stones will pick it up from there we\n[135.7s] have done our part the United Nations\n[138.6s] has set Vision 2030 everyone is watching\n[142.7s] some are not clear of what is going to\n[145.0s] happen the nations of the Earth are\n[146.7s] being taken captives the religious world\n[149.2s] is silent\n[150.7s] take a listen to what is happening to\n[152.5s] the nations of the earth including our\n[154.7s] own country Kenya I want you to listen\n[157.1s] to what the stones are saying these may\n[159.3s] not be necessarily Christians but these\n[161.7s] are faithful citizens of this country\n[164.2s] listen to what they saying and then\n[166.2s] we'll come\n[169.5s] back fellow\n[172.6s] Kenyans uh Steve\n[175.9s] mooa now basically I just wanted to\n[178.2s] touch on few issues uh um I'm one person\n[181.7s] who believes\n[183.1s] that you can never find a solution to\n[186.2s] any problem you're going through as a\n[187.7s] country if you don't\n[190.2s] understand the root cause of these\n[193.0s] problems now you'll agree with me that\n[196.0s] uh the entire\n[199.4s] country is in shambles in terms of\n[203.2s] people's emotions and uh the feelings\n[206.6s] you know people feel betrayed people\n[208.6s] feel uh the cost of living is gone up\n[212.0s] you know they were promised so much and\n[213.6s] they're not getting anything and it's\n[216.3s] it's very important for Kenyans to\n[218.4s] understand what is really happening in\n[219.8s] this\n[220.8s] country uh without doubt and fear of\n[224.4s] contradiction I'll tell you that the\n[226.5s] entire Kenyan systems from the political\n[229.4s] to the economic I'll say even probably\n[231.9s] the\n[232.7s] social uh systems have been taken over\n[236.1s] by the globalists today as we speak\n[240.2s] the globalists control our entire\n[242.6s] political system policy systems and the\n[245.9s] economic systems when I talk of the\n[247.8s] globalist I'm talking of the IMF I'm\n[249.4s] talking of the World Bank I'm talking of\n[250.8s] the world economic forum and we have to\n[253.9s] understand what these people are and\n[257.5s] what their intentions are in the long\n[259.9s] run now I'll take you\n[263.2s] briefly uh towards the history so that\n[266.3s] you understand where I'm coming from\n[269.0s] remember\n[270.4s] all these people work through serious\n[273.2s] organizations like the United Nations\n[275.9s] the United Nations was created\n[280.4s] immediately after the second world war\n[282.2s] that was in 1946 in the 13th of February\n[285.8s] 1946 the United Nations formulated a\n[289.7s] document called the United Nations\n[291.6s] Charter in the charter it states clearly\n[294.8s] that its key\n[296.5s] objective is to break down the sovereign\n[299.7s] ities of countries and create a one\n[302.6s] world government that is very clear and\n[305.3s] as I've said I'm not here to propagate\n[307.1s] anything this is information that is out\n[309.7s] there go to the net go to the web look\n[312.7s] for the United Nation chter and you'll\n[314.9s] find this information it states it's it\n[318.1s] states down everything all the\n[320.2s] regulations all all all all all all the\n[324.2s] advantages that the UN will have which\n[326.9s] is their agenda now during the that time\n[331.1s] with this big agenda and remember even\n[333.4s] before the second world war the great\n[335.1s] leaders for example the likes of uh the\n[339.2s] likes of Hitler the likes of Stalin they\n[342.5s] all had the similar objective of\n[345.9s] controlling the whole world but they\n[347.8s] failed because with them they resulted\n[350.7s] to using Force which didn't\n[353.2s] work now after the formulation of the\n[356.4s] UN these\n[358.4s] organizations were were run by a group\n[361.0s] of cabals or bosses or globalists known\n[365.7s] as the build thebad Group which later on\n[369.1s] changed its name in 1971 to the world\n[372.5s] economic Forum now led by a German\n[374.8s] Economist called Cloud show\n[377.8s] up later on during this period the world\n[382.0s] was experiencing what to call the Cold\n[383.6s] War so immediately the Cold War ended in\n[387.8s] 1991 the club of Rome\n[390.8s] started\n[392.9s] accelerating this idea of the new world\n[395.4s] order or the world world uh One World\n[399.0s] Government remember it is even evident\n[402.7s] they did a book there's a book called\n[405.4s] the\n[406.7s] first Global Revolution if you have time\n[410.8s] go online look for that book read that\n[412.7s] book that book States clearly that the\n[414.6s] biggest enemy of the world is Humanity\n[418.3s] itself in 1992 more than 166 country\n[423.0s] countries met under the UN and signed\n[426.8s] and agreed that the biggest problem the\n[428.8s] world is experiencing is overpopulation\n[431.6s] and that they should create and\n[433.8s] formulate ways on how to depopulate the\n[438.6s] world and I'm telling you Kenyans this\n[441.0s] is information that is out there you can\n[442.6s] go out there research read and get to\n[448.3s] understand the acceleration started and\n[452.0s] they formulated a document under the\n[454.8s] world economic Forum if you read if you\n[456.8s] go and read about the world economic\n[458.3s] Forum this is an umbrella of the\n[459.6s] globalist the rich people of the world\n[461.5s] they meet in a place called Davos every\n[463.4s] year in Switzerland and they decide the\n[466.5s] way forward you know this year we'll\n[468.6s] invest in this we'll put these laws\n[470.5s] we'll put this formulate this policies\n[472.6s] in these countries and so forth create\n[474.9s] this and create that destabilize this\n[476.5s] and stabilize that that is they they\n[480.0s] they they are in quotes the bosses of\n[482.7s] the world to me I believe you're all\n[484.4s] equal but that's their mentality which\n[487.0s] they have a right to believe the what\n[488.6s] whatever they\n[490.8s] believe in their strategy of\n[494.5s] depopulation and\n[498.0s] control in order to create the One World\n[501.7s] Government they picked on few issues to\n[505.6s] tackle number one the basic thing to do\n[508.8s] to control Mankind and also to\n[511.9s] depopulate mankind is control the food\n[514.4s] you control the food you\n[516.6s] control\n[518.8s] Humanity so they've been putting in\n[522.4s] place enforcing leaders whom they\n[525.6s] control in all these\n[527.3s] countries to create policies that at the\n[530.6s] end of the\n[532.7s] day will frustrate the citizens will\n[535.9s] create food shortages and will end up\n[539.6s] creating hunger starvation hence\n[542.6s] depopulation will be there either in the\n[545.0s] form of malnutrition or lack of food and\n[547.6s] these things are coming I'm not joking\n[549.4s] you want to take it for granted it's up\n[550.9s] to you since no leader is talking about\n[553.1s] this since no leader understands what's\n[555.6s] going on I have taken this mantle to\n[557.7s] talk to Kenyans so that let us discuss\n[560.0s] the real issues let us discuss what is\n[562.2s] ailing this country if we can solve that\n[565.0s] problem I'm telling you our problem is\n[566.6s] not money our problem is not economy\n[569.4s] those are things we can solve we've done\n[571.6s] it before kibaki did it\n[573.8s] before without help from anyone we have\n[577.2s] best brains in this country but we have\n[579.8s] to understand that our president has\n[581.5s] been held captive and it did not start\n[584.4s] with\n[585.5s] Ruto if you look at all these\n[589.1s] policies all these policies the\n[591.5s] implementations started during uru\n[595.6s] time I was in odm I was an neck member\n[598.8s] and I'll tell you\n[600.5s] 101% and any neck member including R\n[603.6s] oinga himself will\n[605.1s] confirm I am the only person who left\n[608.5s] and told them there's a game being\n[610.9s] played and I guaranteed and even if you\n[613.8s] go to our walls before they remove me\n[615.6s] from the group go to the walls of the\n[617.6s] neck my last message was we will go to\n[620.9s] elections in the next two years and uru\n[623.1s] will never take Raa to gay live alone\n[626.1s] Mount Kenya as much as uru does not like\n[629.0s] rut he had no option these were\n[632.0s] conditions given to him and they knew\n[634.4s] they cannot control R odinga that's why\n[637.4s] he had to pass the mantle to Ruto let no\n[640.0s] one lie to you they might have their own\n[641.9s] personal differences they don't like\n[643.6s] each other but they they\n[647.4s] all are were and are controlled by the\n[650.8s] same system that that one you can take\n[653.1s] it to the bank now I'll speak of the few\n[655.6s] things that we've seen in this country\n[657.4s] that are being formulated after told you\n[660.9s] the New World Order agenda aims to\n[664.6s] control the whole world by creating a\n[667.8s] One World Government when I talk of a\n[669.4s] One World Government I'm talking of one\n[671.5s] government one president one Army one\n[674.4s] Judicial System you know and it trickles\n[679.4s] down for them to do that they came with\n[682.2s] a formulation document number one\n[683.9s] control the food number\n[687.1s] two identity\n[689.9s] and that's when they came with the new\n[691.9s] idea of the digital identity through the\n[694.2s] help of it so that they can be able to\n[697.1s] control and know each and every movement\n[700.4s] of each and every person on Earth these\n[703.4s] things are real these things are coming\n[705.6s] now let me let let me touch on let me\n[707.9s] touch on\n[709.5s] food how how how how are they going to\n[712.1s] do it it's through formulation of\n[714.4s] policies they came up with the agenda of\n[716.7s] climate change what does climate change\n[720.2s] has to do with agriculture number one\n[722.8s] with the climate change formulation\n[724.7s] policy it says agriculture in itself is\n[728.5s] what is creating the changes in\n[731.7s] climate number one they're bringing in\n[734.8s] restrictions on nitrogen fertilizers\n[737.7s] number two we have seen in Kenya\n[741.4s] here even from kinu time when he\n[744.4s] formulated what we call the strategy\n[746.1s] document when he was the minister today\n[749.4s] it is illegal to share seeds so even\n[752.3s] organic seeds if I'm to give my neighbor\n[754.2s] for him to plant in his 100 acres it is\n[756.3s] illegal we created policies to allow\n[759.4s] foreign companies to come and patent\n[761.3s] their seeds here which you're not\n[763.7s] supposed to buy from anyone else apart\n[765.5s] from them and Mark you majority of these\n[768.3s] seeds are genetically modified seeds\n[770.9s] which number one are very expensive to\n[773.1s] buy Al there you go on Google Kenyans\n[776.5s] just check the price of tomato seeds GMO\n[780.1s] tomato seeds the cheapest you'll get is\n[782.2s] about 10 million Shillings per\n[784.9s] kilo the best quality is about 50 60\n[787.6s] million Shillings a kilo of tomato seeds\n[789.9s] so what does that mean if you're forcing\n[791.9s] me to buy these seeds as a normal farmer\n[794.3s] and I can't afford 10 million what what\n[796.5s] is the next thing I'll do I'll abandon\n[798.3s] farming and that's what is happening\n[800.4s] they brought in laws on on on uh potato\n[803.7s] Farmers they brought in funny funny laws\n[807.0s] on farming just to break down the\n[809.9s] farmers and ensure you're no longer in\n[812.1s] the industry same as livestock farming\n[814.3s] what does the climate change policy say\n[815.8s] on climate far uh livestock farming it\n[818.0s] says livestock farming\n[820.2s] releases um greenhouse gases which\n[824.5s] release nitrogen in the air hence affect\n[827.4s] the climate so they're saying now you\n[829.9s] have to register if you have cows if you\n[831.6s] have cattle if you have poultry and if\n[833.6s] you don't there are Hefty fines up to\n[835.4s] millions of shillings to scare you all\n[838.2s] these things are done by Design because\n[840.2s] they want to control the food remember I\n[842.2s] have told you in the world economic\n[844.3s] Forum in the New World Order agenda they\n[846.9s] St very well that the idea is no one\n[850.9s] should own anything the entire land the\n[854.0s] entire farming should be owned by the\n[857.7s] corporations so my friend when you're\n[860.6s] busy talking about this housing project\n[862.2s] housing project the housing projects is\n[866.0s] a must for rut to do them because he's\n[867.9s] been told he must do them simply because\n[871.0s] in the two next few years there's no\n[873.4s] farmer who will be able to farm in this\n[874.9s] country and the next thing they'll do\n[877.0s] they'll give you offers they'll offer\n[878.4s] you money for your farm once you hand\n[881.2s] over your\n[882.3s] farm they'll give you an offer they'll\n[884.3s] tell you by the way we have an apartment\n[886.2s] which you can get at a better price\n[888.1s] you've heard words even from the\n[890.0s] president himself where he says I think\n[891.9s] it is time people should leave rural\n[893.4s] areas and come to urban areas we need to\n[895.5s] free up space for farming free up space\n[897.7s] for farming you know some words like\n[899.7s] building back better you know building\n[901.7s] back better go on YouTube just type\n[904.2s] build back better go on Twitter build\n[906.6s] back better you'll see the people who\n[908.2s] mention that word and what they say\n[910.2s] they're all aligned to this agenda they\n[912.7s] call them sustainable development goals\n[914.9s] it's not sustainable my friend all they\n[916.6s] want is total control I will tell you as\n[918.9s] a Kenyan as a patriot someone who cannot\n[920.6s] be bought and it's sad no leader is\n[923.3s] seeing the angle in which this thing is\n[926.0s] being uh directed so my friends stop\n[929.6s] asking about the housing projects and\n[931.5s] all that all those houses are meant for\n[933.0s] all those who will lose their land\n[934.7s] that's why there's no structure that's\n[936.3s] why even the mes that's why even the the\n[938.6s] Attorney General comes and says he knew\n[940.5s] nothing about this housing thing you\n[942.3s] know because it is above his level it is\n[945.2s] being done by the cabals and it is\n[947.9s] through policies MPS please I know how\n[951.4s] they control you but please before you\n[953.8s] amend and pass these bills read them\n[957.2s] read them when you go to the United\n[959.9s] Nations\n[961.0s] Charter most of the countries in the\n[963.0s] world have even signed that they're\n[965.5s] going to surrender 30% of the\n[969.1s] land to the UN for the purpose of\n[971.6s] Conservancy to preserve\n[974.8s] climate today in Kenya laws are coming\n[978.9s] you know read laws are coming to give\n[981.9s] the Government powers for compulsory\n[984.1s] acquisition of land you know they come\n[986.4s] to kitui and say now the entire kitu we\n[989.2s] need to do some Conservancy here so you\n[992.8s] people have to leave compulsory\n[994.8s] acquisition and you're offering 10\n[996.6s] Shillings per acre or 10 million per\n[998.6s] acre or 1 million or or or or three you\n[1001.9s] know it's government my friend so these\n[1004.2s] things are there and it's the UN saying\n[1005.8s] it they're giving them the the way\n[1008.2s] forward the the path is being created by\n[1012.2s] them\n[1013.8s] now once you control the food it means\n[1018.2s] hunger will come\n[1019.4s] people will be frustrated you've\n[1021.0s] controlled the food number two control\n[1024.2s] their economy frustrate them\n[1026.2s] economically look at this country for\n[1028.2s] the last 10 years when did you hear when\n[1031.2s] did you last hear of a success story\n[1033.1s] there's a businessman who started a\n[1034.4s] business and is doing well you can't do\n[1037.2s] well because the system have been made\n[1040.0s] to break us\n[1043.6s] completely who formulated the law that\n[1046.2s] you can't withdraw 1 million or or\n[1048.3s] deposit more than 1 million\n[1050.6s] Shillings when Ruto was campaigning he\n[1053.5s] said he will make sure he opens up that\n[1055.5s] LW why has it not\n[1057.1s] changed why is\n[1059.5s] it the one who was in charge of Treasury\n[1062.5s] during uhuru's time and the one who was\n[1065.1s] in charge of of of of Central\n[1068.5s] Bank why is it the same people who we sa\n[1072.4s] and cast them that they've brought down\n[1074.5s] our economy why is it that when Ruto\n[1076.8s] came in they didn't bring in new people\n[1078.6s] they just SWA them to went the other\n[1080.6s] side and Jog went to the other side\n[1083.1s] there only two reasons why you'll do\n[1084.7s] that number one it's either to control\n[1087.2s] information or number two to continue\n[1089.6s] doing what they were doing which we I\n[1092.2s] you and I know is breaking the\n[1096.8s] system number\n[1098.7s] three now once you create all these\n[1101.7s] people die of stress you know many\n[1103.4s] people look at look at the the the\n[1105.2s] mental cases going on in the country\n[1107.2s] look at look at the diseases look look\n[1108.9s] at the pressure people are going through\n[1110.8s] economically people are frustrated\n[1112.5s] people are you know it's like people are\n[1114.2s] going crazy now you cannot even Farm\n[1116.4s] there's no food there's nothing what\n[1120.2s] next now that we we've started dealing\n[1123.0s] with the numbers we now need to control\n[1125.0s] them how do we control them we control\n[1126.9s] them through the digital ID remember\n[1129.9s] very soon this entire economic system\n[1132.9s] the dollar system the world Reserve\n[1134.5s] System is going to collapse there's\n[1136.6s] going to be an introduction of the new\n[1138.2s] cbdc they called the Central Bank\n[1140.1s] digital currencies we are all going\n[1142.2s] digital it's like the Bitcoins you know\n[1144.8s] and the digital currency will be\n[1147.4s] attached to your digital identity so my\n[1151.3s] friend you break the rules like you say\n[1154.9s] things against the government for\n[1156.0s] example what I'm saying you can't use\n[1158.9s] your digital currency anywhere you go to\n[1160.7s] a shop to buy skuma you're\n[1164.0s] told so you understand what I mean you\n[1167.0s] know you can't travel you can't move\n[1169.0s] you're told you can't leave Nairobi out\n[1170.8s] of Nairobi my friend your your digital\n[1173.6s] currency cannot work so you cannot\n[1175.4s] survive so those are the things that are\n[1177.6s] coming and how will they do it it's very\n[1179.9s] simple how do you do it you create chaos\n[1183.2s] how do you create chaos to make people\n[1185.9s] adapt the the digital ID because some\n[1189.2s] countries people will Rebel so what do\n[1191.2s] you do open the borders free\n[1194.3s] Visa open the borders because you know\n[1196.8s] the moment I open the Border all that\n[1199.2s] will come\n[1200.8s] in in an expectation in a year or so\n[1204.2s] chaos will erupt then the government now\n[1207.2s] will come as a Good Samaritan and tell\n[1208.8s] you oh please uh because there's so much\n[1211.5s] crime in this country we now need\n[1214.7s] compulsory acquisition of digital IDs to\n[1218.1s] everyone so that we can know each and\n[1220.4s] everyone and my friends you will get\n[1222.4s] that digital ID and once you get that\n[1224.3s] digital ID you are in jail slavery is\n[1227.3s] coming back and this is real I'm saying\n[1229.4s] it from the bottom of my heart and I'm\n[1230.6s] saying I'm not propagating anything this\n[1232.7s] is is information that is out there go\n[1235.0s] read about the Davos agenda go read\n[1237.0s] about the world economic Forum go read\n[1238.9s] about the New World Order go read about\n[1240.8s] the UN Charter and you'll understand\n[1242.6s] where we are heading\n[1245.9s] to that is what is happening my\n[1249.0s] friends that is what is\n[1252.0s] happening not once not twice not Thrice\n[1254.7s] your president himself he's told even\n[1256.6s] his leaders I watched when they had the\n[1258.6s] the PG at state house he said my hands\n[1261.8s] are\n[1262.6s] tied now he's the senior most civil\n[1265.2s] servant in the country he's the boss who\n[1267.8s] else can tie his\n[1270.4s] hand and he's the boss of all bosses in\n[1273.4s] this country it is the globalists and\n[1276.2s] they've taken over and I think he needs\n[1278.9s] help I think he needs help you know we\n[1281.8s] should not just we should not just uh\n[1284.8s] Ambush him I think that man is suffering\n[1287.7s] and he needs help\n[1289.5s] because it's a point of no return today\n[1291.7s] you've seen yesterday they were in\n[1293.3s] Uganda R is opting out and remember the\n[1298.1s] last one of the last interviews Raa did\n[1300.2s] he said I've realized it's not true to\n[1302.0s] who stole my elections my elections were\n[1304.1s] stolen by some people who have interests\n[1305.9s] now it's me telling you because they're\n[1307.4s] always scared to say they're always\n[1310.0s] scared to mention those names because\n[1311.9s] the few leaders who mentioned you know\n[1313.7s] you know you know the story of our\n[1315.3s] neighboring presidents who died finally\n[1317.6s] you know you go yeah we know them you\n[1319.4s] know them you go against them they they\n[1321.8s] deal with you\n[1324.2s] anyway people like us personally I'm not\n[1326.6s] scared of anything the worst thing in\n[1329.1s] life is there's there's one old man who\n[1331.5s] told me the richest place on Earth is\n[1333.6s] the grave because beneath the grave lies\n[1336.8s] so many ideas lies so many eye openers\n[1340.0s] that did not utilize the time when they\n[1343.3s] were\n[1344.2s] alive so I decide to use this time just\n[1348.1s] to talk to to my fellow Kenyans the\n[1350.2s] worst thing is when our kids will grow\n[1352.8s] up and find such we live a beautiful\n[1356.9s] country like this where our forefathers\n[1358.7s] died poured blood for us to have this\n[1361.1s] slavery this beautiful country and we\n[1363.4s] leaving it to the dogs you know it's\n[1365.2s] it's so sad you know when our kids will\n[1366.9s] be asking us daddy mommy where were you\n[1368.8s] when all this was happening we have to\n[1370.6s] start speaking now the media focus on\n[1373.1s] the right issues the media don't be\n[1375.9s] scared what we are saying is let us talk\n[1380.0s] about the fundamental let's Cascade down\n[1382.2s] to the roots and know the real causes of\n[1385.3s] our problems and that's when we'll find\n[1387.6s] a\n[1390.0s] solution the few leaders who've been\n[1392.2s] there and been been trying I want to to\n[1394.9s] to to appla one ok\n[1397.1s] omata but you seem not to to recognize\n[1400.2s] him you know because he's a nobody we\n[1401.8s] are meant to believe that in opposition\n[1403.7s] it is so and so he supposed to talk and\n[1405.8s] so and so he supposed to talk my friend\n[1408.3s] hey every Kenyan has something to say\n[1410.4s] even a beggar on the road can save your\n[1412.9s] life information is power and knowledge\n[1415.3s] is\n[1416.0s] king So Kenyans I urge you and the media\n[1420.0s] from today start researching start\n[1423.2s] reading about all these agenda the New\n[1425.4s] World Order agenda the agenda 2030 the\n[1428.0s] world economic Forum read about the UN\n[1430.4s] Charter read about the globalist agenda\n[1434.4s] and you'll understand what is happening\n[1436.0s] in Kenya it's the same thing that has\n[1437.8s] been happening\n[1439.0s] all over today for the whole of last two\n[1441.8s] weeks you've seen farmers in Germany in\n[1444.0s] Spain in Holland they were all\n[1446.2s] demonstrating why were they\n[1447.6s] demonstrating because of similar\n[1449.6s] policies land is being taken from them\n[1452.0s] now it's being owned by the globalists\n[1453.9s] they said policies where they snatch the\n[1455.6s] land from them and that is what is\n[1457.2s] coming in this country it is coming so\n[1460.4s] are you ready the question is are you\n[1462.6s] ready anyway if there's any leader any\n[1465.8s] person who disputes what I'm saying I'm\n[1467.7s] ready call me for an interview anywhere\n[1470.0s] CNN BBC Al jaaz K call me

doing the work that he desired them to do taking a course to misrepresent the character of god and caused the world to look upon him as a tyrant the very priests who ministered in the temple had lost sight of the significance of the service if they performed they had ceased to look beyond the symbol to the things signified in presenting the sacrificial offerings they were as actors in a play the ordinances which god himself had appointed were made the means of blinding the mind and hardening the heart god could do no more for man through these channels the whole system must be swept away in a s i want to link them with this parable which we are studying another parable about it soma verse 12. they had healed themselves systems that could no longer hold water now a certain man held a great supper just happened now this is one of the parables i'm going to link israel in the seventh day adventism at the end of time one of the parables i'm going to link israel in the seventh day adventism yes in in in in parables trying to link those who shall live at the end of time tonight luke chapter 14. luke chapter 14 jesus gave another parable to link these happenings and occurrences luke chapter 14 verses number 16 luke chapter 14 verses number 16 amen amen a certain man made a great supper this is not breakfast this is not lunch hour call this is supper time now on a somatic chapter 20 that great clock began early hour in the morning until the 11th hour labourers that is nearing the supper time the 11th hour 9 11. no no it begins at early morning breakfast the great advent millerite movement the sixth hour laborers and then when it's nearing supper time just before the 11th hour laborers are called in that is where luke chapter 14 features because this parable is mentioning the great supper that has been beaten to call people in okay this is a special message for god's people who have been given much light at the end of time so this message is god gives another final bid to them first listen to this a certain man made a great supper not a great breakfast not a great lunch hour meal it is a great supper so this parable must be put in its proper location high tomorrow then he called and sent his servant at supper time supper time not breakfast supper time when it's it is nearing the 11th hour in upper caribbean when it is nearing the supper time put these things in your mind i come to mom tomorrow cool at great supper time i wanna all things are ready come to the supper time all things are ready my friends the bible teaches that god has prepared a message at suppertime for seventh-day adventism god intends to bring this message to god's people moon attacker quality what god is talking about the bible says i have bought a piece of field it must needs that i go and see it fast okay that is the first group i have bought a field the first group the second group of individuals they have bought oxen they must go and see them and test them i pray forgive me i am not coming to the great supper this message is preached first to adventism it is not it is not preached to the world at first within jerusalem okay these are three categories of people in adventism a letter message yes [Music] in another parable let's just expound on the field that is being brought here they have volta field they must go and see the field and how it is prospering i have no time for that message okay the field that is brought luke chapter number 12. okay luke chapter number luke chapter number 12 verses number two verses from versus number 16 luke chapter 12 verses number 16. the first group of individuals have bought a field okay so they don't see the great invitation at supper time okay there is a great message just before the crisis just before the loud cry of the third angel goes forth god brings this sort of message as supper time but the first group of individuals on a semano we have just bought a field these are the first group of individuals in adventism because what shall i do sit down my soul relax eat and drink your grounds has brought a lot of increase you are rich and increased with goods satan has blinded their eyes to the things of the world they cannot appreciate the things that are of eternal interest at supper time okay and it's not just any other message god will bring in the message that will arouse god's people to go back to their foundational truths you see jesus was the foundation of the whole jewish economy but the israelites why would you come qatar yes their foundation they had rejected him and they remained to be fig trees with the leaves and without without fruits meat for repentance so how i wanted look at luke chapter 12 verse 21 it continues to say devio um verses number 24 the bible says the billionaire seymour luke chapter 12 those who lay up treasures on earth and they are not uh they are not rich towards god we must be very keen that this invitation comes between the ninth and the eleventh hour there is a message that god must bring to his people just to arouse them just to show them that it is time to prepare for the loud cry of the third angel but the first group of individuals on a semapana sisi took on amalia dunya okay took on amalia dunya okay the bible says in luke chapter 21 verse 34. luke 21 verses number 34 luke 21 verse 34 in a semester take

book ali writings or spiritual gifts we are told page 267 ali writings 267 paragraph number 266 paragraph 1 early writings 266 paragraph 1 i saw that satan baby's angels lay their snares especially for those who are looking for christ's second appearing and keeping all the commandments of god satan told his angels that the churches were asleep what the churches were asleep he would increase his power and lying wonders and he could hold them but he said the sect of sabbath keep us we hate they are continuously working against us and taking from us our subjects to keep the hated law of god look at what satan does go make the processes of lands and money drunk with the chaos if you can make them place their affections upon these things we shall have them yet they may profess what they please only make them care for money than for the success of christ's kingdom or the spread of the truth we hate present the world before them in the most attractive light that they may love and idolize it we must keep in our ranks all the means of which we can gain control the more means the followers of christ devote to his service the more will they injure our kingdom by getting our subjects that one disqualifies them from the great supper and that specific message about a moon on a letter at supper time it is a message to revive and reform god's people let's go back to the book of matthew chapter 14. to build on this matthew chapter 14 remember this is part one of the topic nominal adventism or the remnant takuya conglomerate part two i'm just building luke chapter 14 verses matthew 14 sorry versus number 23 at suppertime there is a message to arouse the people in the ship and jesus went to arouse the people in the boat that lacked faith in that particular ship now on a suffering america jesus had to come to them and why that is why we see ellen white writing in the book last day events page 210 paragraph one let me just read it again to connect supper time a message that will give the baron fig tree hope of not being cut spare it this year also the fourth year is the probationary the fourth message that fourth angel must arrive in history to give hope to god's people and to arouse them from their spiritual liturgy last day events page 210 paragraph one last events page 210 lde page 210 paragraph 1 then we'll go to those who have married a wife and then we'll build our topic from there as to why israel must be cut if it does not produce fruits meat for repentance last day events page 210 paragraph number one paragraph okay lde to 10 209 i say sorry lde 209 oh sorry i had ticked a book early writings let me just untick first yes last day events to 10 lde to 10.1 what is the message that god must bring here at the end of time it says it's also from review and herald in a talk review and herald may 27 1890 okay she says there is to be in the seventh-day adventist churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of god and but it will not move upon those who have not humbled themselves before the lord and opened the door of the heart by confession and repentance she says in the manifestation of that power which lightens the earth with the glory of god they will see only something which in their blindness they think dangerous something which will arouse their fears and they will brace themselves to resist it because the law does not work in accordance to their ideas and expectations they will oppose the work why they say should we not know the spirit of god when we have been in the work for so many years then listens she says anasema the third angel's message will not be comprehended the light which will lighten the earth with its glory will be called a false light by those who refuse to walk in its advancing glory sasa there is a message that is to come at supper time but the rich and increased with the goods on assam associated the other category of individuals these three categories of individuals they will continue to show the green leaves look at the third group of individuals we go back to luke chapter 14. we are reached and increased with good and have need of nothing we don't want that invitation to take that is the problem with laodicea you see it is fatal blindness nasa's spiritual prophet and we put things in order luke chapter 14 look at the third group of individuals in adventism is what is hindering the third group of individuals from heeding that invitation that jesus has suddenly come to his temple to arouse them that is disqualifying them [Music] from becoming partakers of this particular message okay let us build this from the bible revelation 14 verse 4. revelation chapter 14. revelation 14 concerning god's people in the last days the bible teaches others these are they which are not defiled with women for they are virgins they profess a pure holy faith they cannot be married to the women of the land this has been a problem in all ages and this is one of the reasons as to why at supper time some will forfeit the invitation and they will disqualify themselves in giving the third angel's message marrying wives strange women in the bible we see people doing that solomon loved many strange women he disqualified himself and god questioned him we see israel doing the same in the times of ezra let's build this in the bible let's build this in the bible we see it happen in the times of ezra the bible teaches that they marry strange women i've just quoted king solomon in in first kings chapter 11 verse 1. that is king solomon and again we see in the times of ezra nehemiah in the times of ezra nehemiah we see the holy seed mingling itself with strange women we are in the book of ezra now uniforte visuri the third group is saying we have married wives we have just married ezra chapter 9 verses 1 and 2. this has been repeated over and over and over and over in the history of god's people marrying women strange wives ezra chapter nine moon ezra chapter nine the bahrain fig tree is it nominal adventist or the remnant first samuel second samuel first king second kings ezra nehemiah we are in the book of ezra second kings i am handling first kings first second kings first chronicles second chronicles then ezra ezra chapter nine amen to kopali mandika and i say my a entered into an abomination of marrying the wives of the land in the parable of luke chapter 4 14 the third group says we have married wives they have joined themselves into apostate protestantism and they have accepted their doctrines they have accepted to be one with them you see bibliona and get this very carefully is one of the reasons as to why god must raise the people to give the loud cry of the third angel it's one of the reasons you see we are told we are told in testimonies for the church volume 4 page 2 11 paragraph 2 testimonies 40 testimonies for the church volume 4 page number 211 paragraph number two we are told we are told we are told and listen very carefully we are told i'm beginning from paragraph number one it is satan's plan to weaken the faith of god's people in the testimonies next follows skepticism in regard to the vital points of our faith the pillars of our positions then doubted us to the holy scriptures and then the downward march to perdition when the testimonies which were once believed are doubted and given up satan knows the deceived ones will not stop at this and redoubles its efforts till he launches them into an open rebellion which becomes incurable and ends into destruction satan gained marked advantage in because the people of god have not guarded the outposts the very men whose labors god has signified that he would accept if they were fully concentrated have been the ones to be deceived to fail in their duties and to prove a terrible burden and discouragement instead of the help and blessing that they should have been these men who have been trusted to keep the fought have well now betrayed it into the hands of the enemy that awaited us betrayal they have betrayed god into the hands of the enemy they have opened the gates to a willie four enemy who has sought to destroy them men of experience have seen stealthy hands sleeping the balls that satan might enter yet they have held their peace with apparent indifference as to the results some have been glad to see this as it seemed an extenuation of their past neglect which made it a necessity to call for others to fill the posts of responsibility that they had abused or neglected they have betrayed to the enemy they have married themselves to the wives wives testimonies volume 8. near the fallen churches it makes adventists to become nominal wannabe representatives hawana they have nothing that can show totally that these are god's people they remain in name wakanda append testimonies testimonies volume 8 80 page 249 ht page 249 paragraph number three testimonies volume 8 page 249 paragraph 3 in a sema the heavenly teachers inquire what stronger delusion can beguile the mind than the pretence that that you are building on the route right foundation and that god accepts your works when in reality you are working out many things are called according to worldly policy and are sinning against jehovah oh it is a great deception amen they are saying they have married okay it is a great deception a fanaticism a fascinating delusion that takes possessions of the mind when men who have once known the truth must take the form of godliness for the spirit and power thereof when they suppose that they are rich and increased with goods and in need of nothing while in reality they are in need of everything god has not changed toward his faithful servants who are keeping their garments spotless but many are crying peace and safety while sudden destruction is coming upon them shaw kai mayweak or conomit unless there is a thorough repentance unless men humble their hearts by confession and receiving the truth as it is in jesus they will never enter heaven who can truthfully say our gold is tried in the fire our garments are unspotted by the world i saw our instructor pointing to the garments of so-called self-righteousness stripping them off he laid bare the defilement beneath then he said to me can you not see how they are potentially pretentiously covered up the defilement and rottenness of character how is the faithful city become unharlot my father's house is made a house of mechanized a place once the divine presence and glory have departed for this cause there is

have fallen churches nominal adventists and before the plagues shall be poured out ministers and the people will be called out from these churches and will gladly receive the truth satan knows this and before the loud cry of the third angel is given he raises an excitement in these religious bodies that those who have rejected the truth may think that god is with them he hopes to deceive the honest and lead them to think that god is still working for the churches but the light will shine and all who are honest will leave the fallen churches and take their stand with the remnant fallen

to the world to them faust was given the opportunity to become heralds of the kingdom of grace of god but israel knew not the time of her visitation the jealousy and distrust of the jewish leaders had ripened into open hatred and the hearts of the people were turned away from jesus who heard the truth the sanhedrin had rejected christ's message and was bent upon his death therefore jesus departed from jerusalem from the priests the temple the religious leaders the people who had been instructed in the law and turned to another class to proclaim his message and to gather out those who should

baby's angels lay their\n[2710.5s] snares especially for those who are\n[2712.1s] looking for christ's second appearing\n[2714.3s] and keeping all the commandments of god\n[2717.0s] satan told his angels that the churches\n[2719.4s] were asleep what\n[2721.5s] the churches were asleep\n[2723.2s] he would increase his power and lying\n[2725.4s] wonders and he could hold them but\n[2730.3s] he said\n[2731.6s] the sect of sabbath keep us we hate\n[2734.7s] they are continuously working against us\n[2737.6s] and taking from us our subjects to keep\n[2741.0s] the hated law of god look at what satan\n[2743.6s] does\n[2744.7s] go\n[2745.5s] make the processes of lands and money\n[2748.4s] drunk with the chaos\n[2750.6s] if you can make them place their\n[2752.3s] affections upon these things\n[2754.4s] we shall have them yet they may profess\n[2758.3s] what they please only make them care for\n[2761.0s] money than for the success of christ's\n[2763.5s] kingdom or the spread of the truth we\n[2766.2s] hate\n[2767.0s] present the world before them in the\n[2769.1s] most attractive light that they may love\n[2772.6s] and idolize it\n[2774.5s] we must keep in our ranks\n[2777.3s] all the means\n[2778.8s] of which we can gain control the more\n[2782.1s] means the followers of christ devote to\n[2783.9s] his service the more will they injure\n[2785.9s] our kingdom by getting our subjects\n[2803.0s] that one disqualifies them from the\n[2805.4s] great supper and that specific message\n[2809.4s] about a moon on a letter at supper time\n[2811.4s] it is a message to revive and reform\n[2813.8s] god's people let's go back to the book\n[2815.4s] of matthew chapter 14.\n[2817.6s] to build on this matthew chapter 14\n[2819.7s] remember this is part one\n[2822.2s] of the topic\n[2823.9s] nominal adventism or the remnant takuya\n[2826.6s] conglomerate part two i'm just building\n[2829.8s] luke chapter 14 verses matthew 14 sorry\n[2832.7s] versus number 23\n[2835.5s] at

that particular ship now on a\n[2911.1s] suffering america jesus had to come to\n[2913.8s] them\n[2915.2s] and why that is why we see ellen white\n[2917.3s] writing in the book last day events page\n[2919.3s] 210 paragraph one let me just read it\n[2921.0s] again to connect supper time\n[2923.7s] a message that will give the baron fig\n[2926.2s] tree hope\n[2927.8s] of not being cut\n[2932.8s] spare it this year also the fourth year\n[2937.0s] is the probationary the fourth message\n[2940.6s] that fourth angel must arrive in history\n[2944.2s] to give hope to god's people and

paragraph 1 then we'll go to those who\n[2965.1s] have married a wife\n[2967.1s] and then we'll build our topic from\n[2968.8s] there as to why israel must be cut\n[2972.7s] if it does not produce fruits meat for\n[2975.1s] repentance\n[2976.7s] last day events page 210\n[2979.0s] paragraph number one\n[2981.7s] paragraph\n[2983.0s] okay lde to 10\n[2986.1s] 209 i say sorry\n[2988.8s]

message\n[3009.2s] that god must bring\n[3012.3s] here at the end of time it says it's\n[3014.2s] also from review and herald in a talk\n[3016.2s] review and herald\n[3017.7s] may 27 1890\n[3020.8s] okay\n[3022.6s] she says\n[3026.4s] there is to be in the seventh-day\n[3028.2s] adventist churches a wonderful\n[3029.8s] manifestation of the power of god\n[3032.5s] and but it will not move upon those who\n[3035.2s] have not humbled themselves before the\n[3037.1s] lord and opened the door of the heart by\n[3039.2s] confession\n[3040.4s] and repentance\n[3041.9s] she says\n[3043.2s] in the manifestation of that power which\n[3046.2s] lightens the earth with the glory of god\n[3048.9s] they will see only something which in\n[3050.8s] their blindness they think dangerous\n[3053.3s] something which will arouse their fears\n[3055.8s] and they will brace themselves to resist\n[3057.6s] it because the law does not work in\n[3059.6s] accordance to their ideas and\n[3061.1s] expectations they will oppose the work\n[3063.8s] why they say should we not know the\n[3066.2s] spirit of god when we have been in the\n[3068.4s] work for so many years then listens\n[3071.8s] she says anasema the third angel's\n[3074.2s] message will not be comprehended the\n[3076.2s] light which will lighten the earth with\n[3077.8s] its glory will be called a false light\n[3079.8s] by those who refuse to walk in its\n[3081.5s] advancing glory\n[3083.4s] sasa\n[3085.4s] there is a message that is to come at\n[3087.0s] supper time\n[3088.6s] but the rich and increased with the\n[3091.0s] goods on assam associated\n[3093.5s] the other category of individuals\n[3098.2s] these three categories of individuals\n[3100.7s] they will continue to show the green\n[3102.5s] leaves\n[3112.4s] look at the third group of individuals\n[3116.2s] we go back to luke chapter 14.\n[3127.8s] we are reached and increased with good\n[3130.6s] and have need of nothing we don't want\n[3133.6s] that invitation\n[3135.6s] to take\n[3137.8s] that is the problem with laodicea you\n[3139.5s] see\n[3140.4s] it is fatal blindness nasa's\n[3143.3s] spiritual prophet\n[3144.9s] and we put things in order\n[3148.2s] luke chapter 14\n[3150.1s] look at the third group of individuals\n[3152.6s] in adventism\n[3163.0s] is\n[3169.3s] what is hindering the third group of\n[3172.2s] individuals\n[3173.6s] from heeding that invitation\n[3176.7s] that jesus has suddenly come to his\n[3179.2s] temple to arouse them\n[3210.4s] that is disqualifying them\n[3212.3s] [Music]\n[3213.7s] from\n[3215.8s] becoming\n[3217.1s] partakers of this\n[3219.1s] particular message\n[3221.3s] okay\n[3229.4s] let us build this from the bible\n[3230.9s] revelation 14 verse 4.\n[3234.1s] revelation chapter 14.\n[3238.6s] revelation 14\n[3240.5s] concerning god's people in the last days\n[3242.4s] the bible teaches\n[3247.0s] others\n[3256.9s] these are they which are not defiled\n[3260.2s] with women for they are virgins\n[3263.0s] they profess a pure holy faith\n[3266.1s] they cannot be married to the women of\n[3268.3s] the land this has been a problem in all\n[3271.0s] ages and this is one of the reasons as\n[3273.4s] to why at supper time\n[3275.1s] some will forfeit the invitation and\n[3278.2s] they will disqualify themselves in\n[3280.6s] giving the third angel's message\n[3286.4s] marrying wives strange women\n[3291.0s] in the bible we see people doing that\n[3292.8s] solomon loved many strange women\n[3295.9s] he disqualified himself and god\n[3298.1s] questioned him\n[3299.6s] we see israel doing the same in the\n[3301.4s] times of ezra\n[3303.6s] let's build this in the bible\n[3305.8s] let's build this in the bible\n[3307.9s] we see it happen in the times of ezra\n[3311.2s] the bible teaches\n[3313.8s] that\n[3315.0s] they marry\n[3316.6s] strange women\n[3319.5s] i've just quoted king solomon in in\n[3322.2s] first kings chapter 11 verse 1.\n[3329.6s] that is king solomon\n[3333.7s] and again we see in the times of ezra\n[3335.8s] nehemiah\n[3342.6s] in the times of ezra nehemiah we see the\n[3344.9s] holy seed\n[3347.3s] mingling itself\n[3350.5s] with strange women\n[3353.8s] we are in the book of\n[3355.8s] ezra\n[3357.9s] now uniforte visuri\n[3360.1s] the third group is saying we have\n[3362.2s] married wives\n[3375.0s] we have just married\n[3377.5s] ezra chapter 9 verses 1 and 2.\n[3381.1s] this has been repeated over and over and\n[3384.3s] over and over in the history of god's\n[3386.9s] people marrying women strange wives\n[3392.2s] ezra chapter nine moon\n[3396.8s] ezra\n[3398.5s] chapter nine\n[3400.5s] the bahrain fig tree is it nominal\n[3402.6s] adventist or the remnant\n[3406.2s] first samuel second samuel first king\n[3408.4s] second kings\n[3409.9s] ezra\n[3411.2s] nehemiah we are in the book of ezra\n[3414.9s] second kings\n[3417.4s] i am handling first kings\n[3420.2s] first\n[3421.2s] second kings first chronicles\n[3423.5s] second chronicles then ezra ezra chapter\n[3426.6s] nine amen to kopali\n[3429.9s] mandika and i say my\n[3500.2s] a\n[3515.2s] entered into an abomination of marrying\n[3518.1s] the wives of the land in the parable of\n[3520.6s] luke chapter 4 14\n[3522.8s] the third group says we have married\n[3525.2s] wives\n[3526.2s] they have joined themselves into\n[3528.9s] apostate protestantism and they have\n[3531.4s] accepted their doctrines they have\n[3533.8s] accepted to be one with them you see\n[3537.4s] bibliona\n[3538.5s] and\n[3539.1s] get this very carefully\n[3541.7s] is one of the reasons as to why god\n[3545.3s] must raise the people to give the loud\n[3547.0s] cry of the third angel\n[3549.0s] it's one\n[3550.4s] of the reasons\n[3552.3s] you see\n[3554.4s] we are told\n[3556.6s] we are told in testimonies\n[3559.4s] for the church\n[3560.9s] volume 4 page 2 11 paragraph 2\n[3565.3s] testimonies 40\n[3569.2s] testimonies for the church volume 4\n[3573.2s] page number 211\n[3576.8s] paragraph number two\n[3579.4s] we are told\n[3583.0s] we are told\n[3586.5s] we are told\n[3588.5s] and listen very carefully\n[3592.2s] we are told i'm beginning from paragraph\n[3594.6s] number one it is satan's plan to weaken\n[3596.9s] the faith of god's people in the\n[3598.2s] testimonies\n[3599.8s] next follows skepticism in regard to the\n[3602.0s] vital points of our faith\n[3604.1s] the pillars of our positions then\n[3605.8s] doubted us to the holy scriptures\n[3608.0s] and then the downward march to perdition\n[3610.7s] when the testimonies which were once\n[3612.6s] believed are doubted\n[3614.6s] and given up satan knows the deceived\n[3617.8s] ones will not stop at this\n[3619.8s] and redoubles its efforts\n[3621.9s] till he launches them into an open\n[3624.5s] rebellion which becomes incurable and\n[3627.7s] ends into destruction\n[3629.8s] satan gained marked advantage\n[3633.4s] in\n[3634.6s] because the people of god have not\n[3636.6s] guarded the outposts\n[3638.5s] the very men whose labors god has\n[3640.5s] signified that he would accept if they\n[3642.9s] were fully concentrated have been the\n[3645.0s] ones to be deceived\n[3646.9s] to fail in their duties and to prove a\n[3649.5s] terrible burden and discouragement\n[3652.6s] instead of the help and blessing that\n[3654.6s] they should have been these men\n[3657.7s] who have been trusted to keep the fought\n[3660.9s] have well now betrayed it into the hands\n[3664.4s] of the enemy that awaited us\n[3672.7s] betrayal they have betrayed god into the\n[3675.7s] hands of the enemy\n[3677.9s] they have opened the gates to a willie\n[3680.8s] four enemy who has sought to

that surrounds our church General Conference and General Conference 7.20 GC SDA General Conference seventh Adventists those people are reading the lessons those people are in Pathfinders who are Marching like much like Jehovah Witnesses those people are matching like Freemasons General Conference SDA this charge that was pure once pure is now being corrupted by the hidden writes hidden customs General Conference SDA where their children are burning candles during rights or ceremonies rights of Ceremonies like induction they're burning candles so we are talking of true education when is true education needed all right when is true education needed by God's people when is the true education message given we are calling God's people from other churches while we are not calling them from corrupt institutions educational institutions that is wrong God's people must at this time prepare to give the loud cry when the great storm comes storm of tests and trials welcome let's pray we are praying Father in heaven we thank you so much for sending us your son whom we believe and trust he will open up to us the book seal within and without written within and without so that we may understand events that are to take place and that we may also understand and comprehend the love in which you have loved us with broad high low hour or wide Lord we know you have loved us with the love that no any other can measure with God we know you do not spare your son and now we are more than conquerors we only need to understand give us strength for understanding your grace is sufficient in our weakness strength is given for them that are asking and those who Hold Up Hold Your Hand will gain strength and make peace with thee give us strength in Jesus Christ we pray amen so we are told that we have to understand the time in which we are living in all right let us see is that a habit in the time of our living okay all right all right okay so we are seeing we are asking ourselves what is the time in which you are living you and I live do we need to education right now there's some people are saying ah to education honest was in seventh Adventures it was taught long time ago let me read your quote I'm reading you two quotations to understand that their true education was kept for the last days in these days for you to understand it is in these days you have to understand the science of the time so that like in level in Romans Chapter 13 Verse 11. knowing the time that the day is drawing now let us wake up from the sleep then we will not be like the sleeping foolish virgins although they all slept but the wives streamed their lungs in the night let us dream their life let us see we are told that God's people are to Institute uh schools and home schools in the last days there is a book called educational messenger educational messenger spiritual prophecy is going to tell us that in these last days we are supposed to have true education not education with gay system with Eastern religion meditation those are things that shows you it's time wake up all right Wake Up Wait faithful Watchman speak keep not silent we are told is educational messenger ah it has no Pages I'm going to read the first paragraph in the whole chapter educational messenger spiritual prophecy oh my friend all my friends seven Adventists in great in general conference General Conference will not help you as according to what they are doing whatever they are doing is not the first Angel message my friends the angel that is in Revelation 14 6 is seeing to preach to those who are dwelling upon the Earth those who have cultures those who have Tribal doctrines their Book of Revelation shows us water is to come general conference leaders Ted Wilson is teaching us to keep on dressing like the women men to dress like we how can a man dress like a woman what are those things how can you dress like a woman because it is culture so the first Angel message is wrong right it is not to preach to people Nation or tribes or Kindred we are told this let me cool down all right educational messenger it is saying it is dated July 31st 1908 it is after true education has been institution instituted in 1970s we are going to give that history 1970s true education began in service Adventure but this is a prophecy if you love prophecy then let's keep up with this with the pace of the third Angel message let's see July 31st 1908 titled homeschools all right home schools it's saying as Church schools shall be established in the future as Church schools shall be established in the future there is a class of work to be done there is a class of work to be done in connection with them that has not been done in the past oh so there is a light based on true education in the future all right in the closing events Christ is telling us that the work that has been done in the past there shall be our connection to it in the LA in the future so let's see that has not been done in the past all who can who can all who can should or Lucan should have the Privileges of a home church school welcome this is gilgil this is gilgil nakuru County my name is Michael Brown I'm going to take you through all events as they are connected with two education and two church this will be a true church God's people gathered not not General Conference things those people are receiving types to go around the world to put on dress and lower the standards what are those giving us headache in order for prosecution to begin they will just do that let's continue see we are told through education is to take place in the future there's someone who was telling me and I prayed over this that Lord provide convincing truths we are told that true education is to be done in the future read this book uh in the future a few some few weeks uh coming few weeks I'll be able to post this quotation as I'm reading them I'm sorry because the facilities uh I'm raising some money for this Slowly by slowly the work is to go forward by faith and by men of prayer let's see this book is called educational messenger if you have a smartphone download Ellen G white E G white application downloading and install all those books it's time for probation we have to read God is going to give us facilities and if you are in need of one ask God and Shout speak up like right now we are going to see July 31st 1908 this passage has been written in in general conference General Conference has been established by now General Conference was established in 1863. right now three education schools in general conference seven Adventist churches has been established the true education schools were established the Avondale schools the Loma Linda schools that they were on on track coming the uh we have awkward awkward Auckland Oakwood yeah we have those schools the first one began in 719 in 1870s now this is a prophecy for seven Adventists saying as Church schools shall be established in the future there is a class of work to be done in connection with them that has not been done in the past so in the future there is a work that is to be done in connection to the true education that had begun so those people know how to wait to wait unto the Lord they have to know the time 2001 was the time we're going to establish that just give us time now we are reading all who can should all who can should have the Privileges of a home Church School age Church in the school home church school right people have to be taught how to live how to depend on themselves how to be morally upright how to be spiritually strength stronger how to be physically fit how to be knowledgeable in all things reason it will be well if several families in the neighborhood in our neighborhood will unite to employ a humble God-fearing teacher to give the parents the help that is needed in educating their children these are future prophecy somebody asked me Andy told me two education have been there that cannot be the present Truth Listen to this see anything there that schools shall be established in the future all right when the first Angels come down there is a class of work to be done in connection with them there is a class of work in connection to be done in connection with them that has not been done in the past in 1840 1844 1888 or 1870 or 1900 it has not been done but it shall be done in the future a walk so we have to ask what is this we are not going to speculate we are going to ask the Lord as he's going to open the few the the parts of righteousness we are told in Psalms 97 verse 1 verse 11 Psalms 97 11. truth is sown for the Russians we want that truth to be sown God is going to sow unto us the truth is going to come for them that are standing family God is going to give us and we are going to look forward for these events that we cannot fall we are going to stand with the God who controls the will within a will he's going to give us strength to overcome the Beast to overcome the image to overcome the number to overcome the Beast name itself we are going to overcome God is going to give us strength as we're going to strive the condition let us strive for that and let us not in the Middle with affairs with the human Affairs oh I I don't have a work I don't have one to marry I don't have one more to marry one to marry me we are not going to enter middle God is going to provide whatever we need God is going to give us and remember we are not oh thank you my friends ah my friend is just liking this video and we are just going to strive let us strive without a house without a cloth without food without shoes without anything right now we began building the school for your information and all this structure are start at a standstill you can see let me turn my camera can't see behind me right now right away there is a structure that was ongoing it has just uh it is halted because of a few uh misunderstandings but we are going to have the contribution to be raised and this sabbath things are going to be on a behind us just behind you there is a toilet you can see it is under construction and we are going to continue the construction after few understandings they're seeing some few paperworks and all these Landers you're seeing the donor gave it someone gave it up so that we may build at her own supervision she want to see the work go forward she want to see that this land is to be made use of to give God glory god is going to come down and give and and Crown duties and Crown our efforts that we commit unto him all this land has been given behind the toilet as you see there is a land go there is a line of demarcation down to defend and there is another line behind the toilet up just up there is an arboretum as you see that is our Sanctuary up up four to the fast forward to the fence on top we are going to ask them that are of good ability come in and come in and build that which the Lord is saying that we should call people out of institution popular schools as well as we are calling them from churches that are falling let us see is that a quote Oh the second quote tells us as the time comes to call people from Fallen churches there are no names if you want General Conference we are going to prove that general conference is amongst those churches right now we have we don't want crutch no one is we want to establish that the truth right now taking place is to call people from foreign churches and to call people from Fallen popular schools adapting purple Supremacy principles principles that are in concluding to children in order to obey the mark of the beast and the image of the Beast listen I'm going to read from I'm going to read from this book called pamphlet again once more I already eat in the past uh in the past in the Past clip video clip I'm going to read from the book called pamphlets listen carefully the work of true education it's not like you're seeing it in the present true uh present schools that are popular there is look at those syllabus while you are in Kenya in Kenya I'm sad to say this that people who are in Kenya there is a syllabus called cre look at behind look behind Beyond of the textbook down there it is just it has been published it has been printed by Catholics what is what has Catholic to do with the Protestant School what has Catholic Education to do with a Christian Catholic we know it's plainly paganism the worship statue who has names pretentiously he then statues you can't pretend it's time we have to speak up look at this book this book is called pamphlets and uh it's a bit far it's just a bit far out from my reach uh yeah it is the book called pamphlets volume it's called p h 0 8 1. volume 81 let me call it like that pamphlet volume 81. page uh we're going to read from page uh page 37 let us read page yes page 38.1 I'm going to read I'm going to read again the first quotation told us that true education is to be established in the future and there is a work to be done in connection to it that has not been done in the past all right so our ow those people want the truth all right those people want the truth will be added with angels in order to accomplish God's God's Duty on behalf of those children or those parents who want to come out from Babylon churches and Babylon schools all right let's see pamphlets h081 38.1 it says this the command found in Revelation 18.18 verse 4 quote come out of how my people means to come out of those institutions which will place in the minds of our young people principles which are apt to make them join the class of worshipers of which we read in second Timothy 3 5. quit having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof they call themselves Christians but they are weaked wheat you are taking the customs of the world and placing them in the church and having sympathy with them those are two people in the general conference SDA all right they are sympathizing with the world Revelation I mean Romans chapter 12 verse 2 says be a transformed change from the ugliness worldly behaviors and be confirmed be it transformed by the grace of God from the ugliness and be be not conformed do not conform do not do not wear as cats as a man don't teach them to wear trouser there should be a distinction all right all right I'm sorry to say that you're doing it so you are doing great General Conference you are doing that I'm sorry because you're doing it all right you have no Heaven no no place in heaven you are not putting any distinction between true worshipers and false worshipers let's see it is saying we should be just as desires of getting our children out of the popular schools out of the popular school as we are to call the older people out of the popular churches as we are calling the older people from the popular churches we should desire to call to take our children out of popular schools I was reading we are going to put this picture I'm going to put all those pictures in that section comment section you're going to see by own two eyes just what I mean schools in Kenya they are preaching and teaching baptism by water on top of a small baby infant baptism on a small bucket with the reason and Water by there I was baptizing Catholic in 1992. I was just smaller as a baby I'm so sad by these things general conference is just making alliance with those people who have who made us suffer spiritually I don't know why I don't know how it can take place but listen mystery of iniquities taking place in the schools there is something to that is to be done by we who are walking in the vineyard what is the vineyard where the vine is growing some people think the vineyard is the church no the finance is the world where that Believers will gather that is where we call vinyl we are going to study a lot of things Peter prophecy one two three quotations speaking of the same thing Christ is saying the world is the field all right let's see this now we are not in that subject the subject is true education at what point in time to education at what point in time we are seeing that the popular churches are only a product of worldly education so to get at the root of the matter we must separate ourselves from that which creates the condition it creates the condition schools create the condition of Babylon Fallen schools create the condition of Babylon of hidden the hidden School make the hidden Church the Christian School make the Christian Church through education makes the true church principles that are true we have them in the true church when you interpret the Bible correctly in the school you will admin you will fully preach it correctly in the church so listen listen up let's see the background history of schools welcome to the next part I want to have a short video short short video you watch and live on do your duty welcome you know a short video thank you so much",

in\n[534.7s] in general conference General Conference\n[537.2s] has been established by now\n[539.2s] General Conference was established in\n[540.9s] 1863.\n[542.8s] right now\n[544.7s] three education schools in general\n[547.5s] conference seven Adventist churches has\n[550.1s] been established the true education\n[552.1s] schools were established the Avondale\n[554.5s] schools the Loma Linda schools that they\n[557.3s] were on on track coming\n[560.5s] the uh we have awkward awkward Auckland\n[564.0s] Oakwood yeah we have those schools the\n[567.1s] first one began in 719 in 1870s now this\n[571.7s] is a prophecy for seven Adventists\n[573.7s] saying as Church schools shall be\n[575.6s] established in the future there is a\n[577.8s] class of work to be done in connection\n[579.4s] with them that has not been done in the\n[581.9s] past so in the future there is a work\n[585.3s] that is to be done in connection to the\n[587.6s] true education that had begun so those\n[590.8s] people know how to wait to wait unto the\n[593.9s] Lord they have to know the time\n[597.5s] 2001 was the time we're going to\n[600.4s] establish that just give us time now we\n[603.2s] are reading all who can should\n[605.9s] all who can should have the Privileges\n[609.7s] of a home Church\n[612.7s] School\n[613.9s] age Church in the school\n[617.1s] home church school right\n[621.1s] people have to be taught how to live\n[623.2s] how to depend on themselves how to be\n[626.0s] morally upright how to be spiritually\n[628.5s] strength stronger how to be physically\n[632.0s] fit how to be knowledgeable in all\n[636.1s] things\n[637.0s] reason\n[638.3s] it will be well if several families in\n[640.8s] the neighborhood in our neighborhood\n[642.8s] will unite to employ a humble\n[646.0s] God-fearing teacher to give the parents\n[649.3s] the help that is needed in educating\n[651.4s] their children these are future prophecy\n[654.8s] somebody asked me Andy told me two\n[657.6s] education have been there that cannot be\n[659.9s] the present Truth Listen to this\n[662.6s] see anything there that\n[667.4s] schools shall be established in the\n[670.0s] future\n[671.3s] all right when the first Angels come\n[673.1s] down there is a class of work to be done\n[676.0s] in connection with them there is a class\n[679.4s] of work in connection to be done in\n[682.7s] connection with them that has not been\n[685.5s] done in the past\n[687.5s] in 1840 1844 1888 or 1870 or 1900 it has\n[694.4s] not been done but it shall be done in\n[696.5s] the future\n[698.0s] a walk\n[699.6s] so we have to ask what is this we are\n[701.9s] not going to speculate we are going to\n[703.1s] ask the Lord as he's going to open the\n[705.5s] few the the parts of righteousness we\n[708.8s] are told in Psalms 97 verse 1 verse 11\n[712.0s] Psalms 97 11. truth is sown for the\n[715.5s] Russians we want that truth to be sown\n[718.3s] God is going to sow unto us

crutch\n[898.3s] no one is we want to establish that the\n[900.9s] truth right now taking place is to call\n[902.7s] people from foreign churches and to call\n[905.5s] people from Fallen popular schools\n[907.8s] adapting purple Supremacy principles\n[912.0s] principles that are in concluding to\n[914.2s] children in order to obey the mark of\n[917.0s] the beast and the image of the Beast\n[919.3s] listen\n[920.9s] I'm going to read from\n[923.0s] I'm going to read from this book\n[925.8s] called pamphlet again once more I\n[928.3s] already eat in the past uh in the past\n[931.5s] in the Past clip video clip I'm going to\n[934.2s] read from the book called pamphlets\n[935.6s] listen carefully the work of true\n[938.5s] education it's not like you're seeing it\n[940.7s] in the present true uh present schools\n[944.3s] that are popular there is look at those\n[947.0s] syllabus while you are in Kenya in Kenya\n[949.3s] I'm sad to say this that people who are\n[951.5s] in Kenya there is a syllabus called cre\n[954.7s] look at behind look behind Beyond of the\n[958.0s] textbook down there it is just it has\n[960.6s] been published it has been printed by\n[964.3s] Catholics what is what has Catholic to\n[967.3s] do with the Protestant School\n[969.5s] what has Catholic Education to do with a\n[972.3s] Christian Catholic we know it's plainly\n[975.4s] paganism the worship statue who has\n[979.1s] names\n[980.4s] pretentiously\n[981.9s] he then statues you can't pretend it's\n[986.0s] time we have to speak up\n[988.4s] look at this book\n[990.3s] this book is called pamphlets and uh\n[994.2s] it's a bit far it's just a bit far out\n[996.8s] from my reach\n[999.0s] uh\n[1002.5s] yeah it is the book called pamphlets\n[1007.0s] volume it's called p h 0 8 1.\n[1012.3s] volume 81 let me call it like that\n[1014.9s] pamphlet volume 81.\n[1018.3s] page uh we're going to read from page\n[1022.7s] uh\n[1024.8s] page 37\n[1026.9s] let us read\n[1028.6s] page\n[1030.1s] yes\n[1031.4s] page 38.1\n[1033.5s] I'm going to read I'm going to read\n[1035.5s] again\n[1036.5s] the first quotation told us that true\n[1039.3s] education is to be established in the\n[1041.2s] future and there is a work to be done in\n[1043.8s] connection to it that has not been done\n[1046.3s] in the past all right so our\n[1051.3s] ow those people want the truth all right\n[1054.0s] those people want the truth will be\n[1056.2s] added with angels in order to accomplish\n[1059.0s] God's God's Duty on behalf of those\n[1061.9s] children or those parents who want to\n[1064.9s] come out from Babylon churches and\n[1067.2s] Babylon schools all right let's see\n[1069.3s] pamphlets\n[1071.9s] h081\n[1073.6s] 38.1 it says this\n[1076.0s] the command found in Revelation 18.18\n[1078.9s] verse 4 quote come out of how my people\n[1084.1s] means to come out of those institutions\n[1089.1s] which will place in the minds of our\n[1091.8s] young people\n[1093.5s] principles which are apt to make them\n[1097.3s] join the class of worshipers of which we\n[1100.2s] read in\n[1101.2s] second Timothy 3 5. quit having a form\n[1105.1s] of godliness but denying the power\n[1107.6s] thereof they call themselves Christians\n[1109.8s] but they are weaked wheat you are taking\n[1112.5s] the customs of the world and placing\n[1114.4s] them in the church and having sympathy\n[1115.9s] with them those are two people in the\n[1118.4s] general conference SDA\n[1121.0s] all right they are sympathizing with the\n[1124.2s] world Revelation I mean Romans chapter\n[1126.6s] 12 verse 2 says be a transformed change\n[1131.2s] from the ugliness worldly behaviors and\n[1135.5s] be confirmed\n[1137.9s] be it transformed by the grace of God\n[1140.2s] from the ugliness and be be not\n[1143.7s] conformed do not conform do not do not\n[1148.9s] wear as cats as a man don't teach them\n[1152.4s] to wear trouser there should be a\n[1154.4s] distinction\n[1155.5s] all right all right I'm sorry to say\n[1157.6s] that you're doing it so you are doing\n[1159.4s] great General Conference you are doing\n[1162.3s] that I'm sorry because you're doing it\n[1164.1s] all right you have no Heaven no no place\n[1167.1s] in heaven you are not putting any\n[1169.2s] distinction between true worshipers and\n[1173.2s] false worshipers let's see\n[1176.5s] it is saying we should be just as\n[1178.9s] desires of getting our children out of\n[1181.9s] the popular schools out of the popular\n[1185.2s] school as we are to call the older\n[1189.7s] people out of the popular churches as we\n[1192.9s] are calling the older people from the\n[1194.7s] popular churches we should desire to\n[1196.6s] call to take our children out of popular\n[1199.2s] schools I was reading we are going to\n[1202.0s] put this picture I'm going to put all\n[1203.8s] those pictures in that section comment\n[1206.7s] section you're going to see by own two\n[1208.9s] eyes just what I mean\n[1211.6s] schools in Kenya they are preaching and\n[1214.3s] teaching baptism by water on top of a\n[1218.3s] small baby infant baptism on a small\n[1222.3s] bucket with the reason and Water by\n[1225.1s] there I was baptizing Catholic in 1992.\n[1227.5s] I was just smaller as a baby\n[1229.8s] I'm so sad by these things general\n[1232.6s] conference is just making alliance with\n[1236.1s] those people who have who made us suffer\n[1239.4s] spiritually I don't know why I don't\n[1242.1s] know how it can take place but listen\n[1245.0s] mystery of iniquities taking place in\n[1247.3s] the schools there is something to that\n[1249.3s] is to be done by we who are walking in\n[1253.0s] the vineyard what is the vineyard where\n[1255.2s] the vine is growing some people think\n[1256.9s] the vineyard is the church no the\n[1259.1s] finance is the world where that\n[1261.7s] Believers will gather that is where we\n[1263.8s] call vinyl we are going to study a lot\n[1265.6s] of things Peter prophecy one two three\n[1268.3s] quotations speaking of the same thing\n[1270.1s] Christ is saying the world is the field\n[1273.7s] all right let's see this now\n[1276.4s] we are not in that subject the subject\n[1278.1s] is true education at what point\n[1281.1s] in time to education at what point in\n[1285.2s] time we are seeing\n[1287.2s] that the popular churches are only a\n[1290.2s] product of worldly education so to get\n[1292.9s] at the root of the matter we must\n[1295.5s] separate ourselves from that which\n[1297.1s] creates the condition it creates the\n[1299.5s] condition schools create the condition\n[1302.2s] of Babylon Fallen schools create the\n[1304.9s] condition of Babylon of hidden the\n[1309.1s] hidden School make the hidden Church the\n[1312.3s] Christian School make the Christian\n[1315.5s] Church through education makes the true\n[1318.9s] church principles that are true we have\n[1322.2s] them in the true church when you\n[1324.9s] interpret the Bible correctly in the\n[1327.7s] school you will admin you will fully\n[1330.6s] preach it correctly in the church so\n[1334.0s] listen listen up\n[1336.4s] let's see the background history of\n[1339.1s] schools\n[1340.2s] welcome to the next part I want to have\n[1342.9s] a short video\n[1344.1s] short short video you watch and live on\n[1346.3s] do your

1798-1844 that is the period of the first and the second angel's messages the bible say a spirit of prophet says concerning the apostle paul the apostle paul warned the church not to look for the coming of christ in his day that they shall not come says paul except there come inner falling away and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition not until after the great apostasy and the long period of the reign of the man of sin can we look for the advent of christ the man of sin which is also styled the mystery of iniquity moana before the son of perdition and that wicked represents the papacy which as foretold in prophecy was to maintain its supremacy for 1260 years this period ended in 1798 the coming of christ could not take place before that time paul covers with his caution the

messenger or a message that is to prepare the people to welcome the lord to come to his temple appendocrine because jesus comes to his temple literally yes and we see john the baptist being the preparer of the way for the literal coming of christ to his literal temple whatever matthew chapter three the first fulfillment of malachi chapter three fulfills in matthew chapter two angali the first fulfillment me my concern is how does it fulfill in the philadelphia and experience me upon you nico okay matthew chapter 3 the bible says this was the voice that was crying in the wilderness prepare the world way of the lord the lord is suddenly coming to his temple and jesus came when jesus came to his temple he labored amongst his people they reject christ okay now that was the first time when jesus was coming to his temple that was literally yes in the book great controversy we have a whole topic called in his temple but what about the second time because this is john the baptist who is movement the philadelphian experience uh luke chapter one amen luke chapter one the first time jesus came to his temple was in the time of ephesus 1840 to 1844 mana you and your mother uh luke chapter one john came in the spirit and the power of elijah allahu spiritual prophecy naturally according to the great advent millerite movement you see a similarity luke chapter 1 and verses number 17. the bible says in luke chapter 1 verses number 17 amen luka modiakuminasa so john shall go before christ in the spirit and power of elijah that is the first time when jesus is coming in his temple the first time look at it the second time revelation chapter 10 yes he comes to empower that great advent movement 1842-1844 and that is the second time when jesus comes in his temple the second time skeletal spirit of prophet sinatra behave spirit of prophecy says in early writings 233 ali writings page 233 paragraph 1 early writings page 233 paragraph one look at what spiritual prophecy says concerning that movement she says she says when milarite movement was raised by god i saw that god was in the proclamation of the time in 1843 it was his design to arouse the people and bring them to a testing point were they where they should decide for or against the truth ministers were convicted of the correctness of the positions taken on the prophetic periods and some renounced for their pride and left their salaries and their churches to go forth from place to place to give the message but as the message from heaven could find a place in the hearts but of but a few of the professed ministers of christ the work was laid upon many who are not preachers some left their fields to sound the message in anywhere ministers laid aside this is paragraph three they are sanctarian views of and feelings and united in proclaim proclaiming the coming of jesus it continues those whose lives had been marked with dishonesty were anxious to make restitutions parents felt the deepest solitude for their children it was a period of repentance pointy anguish she says thousands were led to embrace the truth preached by william miller and the servants of god were raised up in the spirit and the power of elijah to proclaim the message like john the forerunner of jesus those who preached this solemn message felt compelled to lay the axe at the root of the tree and call upon men to bring forth fruits need for repentance so you see 1840 empowerments and his companions they were raised in the spirit and power of elijah wakapeleca amen this is the second time jesus comes to his temple okay these are called prophetic parallels yes his temple revelation 18 about angelia queso that mighty angel again must come down just before the final crisis three times jesus comes to his temple maratha anakulamaka temple yak in the times of john the baptist philadelphia fss in the times of philadelphia and the times of laura kia maratha three histories linked together that is why elenota nasima in great controversy 6 11 paragraph 1 the mighty angel that comes down to lighten the earth with his glory that final movement movement here mushroom will be likened to the movement of 1840 to 1844 amen amen amen amen yes matthew 7 24 that the house that is built upon the rock can not fall when the storm comes there is a crisis the san diego crisis is likened to the storm spiritual prophecies nasima as the storm approaches many who have professed faith in the third angels message and have not been sanctified by it they will abandon their positions and join ranks with the enemy what storm is coming apart from the sunderland crisis now yes when i say my number uh you what does the bible teach matthew chapter 7 verse 21 to summit the foundation is laid before the mighty angel comes down the foundation continues to be laid until 1844 s okay when the lord shall open the reigns the windows of heaven the great outpouring of the lattering that corinthians chapter 3 verses number 11. the bible says in first corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. the foundations are laid under the first message and the second message full stop those who go back to the foundations to find fault with the foundations can never receive the latter rain and work the final messages of the lovecraft that are dangerous now that can you very clearly and that is why we will have debates in adventism worldwide people will begin debating because they are those who are leaving the platform the foundations of adventism niko kartika first corinthians uh chapter number three verses number 11 first corinthians chapter 3

they see and your ears for they hear for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you have seen and they have not been able blessed are the eyes we saw the things which was seen in 1843 and in 1844 the message was given and there should be no delay in repeating the message 40 41 42 43 44 all the messages foundational truths the message was given and there should be no delay in repeating the message for the signs of the times are fast fulfilling the closing work must be done what is the closing work it is the loud cry of the third angel when revelation 18 comes to reality the closing work must be done a great work will be done in a short time a message will soon be given by god's appointment that will swell into a loud cry then daniel will stand in his lot to give his testimony california whatever point of doctrine you are controversing right now i want to find a debate it does not matter whether you are conscious or not whether you are debating these truths consciously or unconsciously people are taking positions do we return back to our foundational truths or do we remain on the platform that has been built on timbus writings that is where trouble began early writings let me search for early writings and then to rudy katkapibilia philadelphia experience 1842 1844 the foundation was laid by god himself uh another quotations ali writings that the vitelli on yeshua spiritual gifts spiritual gifts volume 1 of kiriko 1sg spiritual gifts volume 1 1 sg page 168 paragraph 2. okay spiritual gifts 258 paragraph three listen to how spiritual prophecies linking these prophetic lines spiritual gifts or ali writings 258.3 ali writings 258.3 she says i saw a company well guarded and farmed nikauna ki kunichawatumbacha waliku naimara omisimama giving no countenance to those who would unsettle the established faith of the body god looked upon them with a probation i was shown three steps the first second and the third angel's message said my accompanying angel woe unto him that shall move a block or star pin of these messages the true understanding of these messages is of vital importance the destiny of souls hangs in the balance in the manner in which these messages are received i was again brought down through these messages and so how dearly the people of god had purchased their experience what was reported experience yeah philadelphia experience it had been obtained through much suffering and severe conflict god had led them along step by step until he had placed upon them a solid immovable platform solid immovable yeah i saw individuals approach the platform and examine the foundation some with rejoicing immediately stepped upon it others commenced to find the fold with the foundation they wished improvements made and then the platform would be more perfect and the people much happier some stepped off the platform to examine it and declared it to be laid wrong the foundation was laid wrong let's step off the platform listen and the people must appear some step of the platform to uh to examine it and declared it to be laid wrong but i saw that nearly all stood upon the farm platform and exhorted those who had stepped off to seize their complaints for god was the master builder and they were fighting against him they recounted the wonderful work of god which had led them to the farm platform and in union raised their eyes to heaven and with a loud voice glorified god an honor then on a semi i was pointed back to the proclamation of the first advent of christ john was sent in the spirit and power of elijah to prepare the way for jesus those who rejected the testimony of jesus of john were not benefited by the teachings of jesus their opposition to the message that foretold is coming place them in a worst position where they could not really receive the strongest deletion so anatomy the immovable platform the bt 1840 to 1844 mungo america are debating our foundational truths just know something in your mind that platform is immovable it has been laid upon a solid foundation nada white and ander cosima the foundation of advertising adventism consists of truths okay concerning the truth in consoles on writers and editors cw page 29 paragraph one consoles and writers consoles to writers and editors cw page twenty nine paragraph one let the truths that are the foundation of our faith be kept before the people let the truths that are the foundation of our faith be kept before the people how could semia comba let theologians or some people go and examine the foundation and replace them and bring them before the people no no no no no no no no no no worldwide adventism there are so many people professing to be seventh-day adventism but when you begin to examine their foundation it is built upon sand it is built upon timbus they have left the platform of eternal truth 1798 to 1844 46 years letter the first angel's message the second annual message the third angel's message is john chapter 2 verse 19. i am not going to touch the 46 years but i'm going to rebuild it in three days three days 46 years the 46 years are there 1798 to 1844 but the three days now god brings the first angel's message the first day the second angel's message 1842 the second day then the third angel's message october 22 1844 the house begins to be built the foundations are laid and they are upon a solid platform let the truths that are the foundation of our faith be kept before the people some will depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils hajja say massam will depart from the church you can't be in the church but not in the faith of the first second and third angel you are not in the foundation and this is a difference that most adventists have never even realized in pakistan you see you can't be in the church but outside the faith that's why paul says in second corinthians thirteen verse one even appalling ana sema ii corinthians chapter 13. the bible says verses number five second corinthians 13 verse 5. the bible says yeah test yourselves whether you be in the faith not you've been the church you can't be in the church but not in the faith that faith that lays the foundations okay she says in cw 29.1 some will depart from the faith giving heed to say this in spirits and doctrines of devils they talk science and the enemy comes in and gives them an abundance of science but it is not the science of salvation it is not the science of humility of concentration or of the sanctification of the spirit we are now to understand what the pillars of our faith are the truth that have made us as a people what we are leading us on step by step amen amentopia review and herald of may 25 1905. that point is clear and that is why unapologetic let's go back to the bible when the children of israel came out of babylon and they went to rebuild the foundation okay there's something that happened very funny you see when you begin to lay another foundation it cannot be powerful or perfect as the first foundation that god laid i wish i can let's go to the book of hagai hagai they cry why do they cry kuan nino analia the reason is they they look at these foundations which are being led laid out and now let's go to haggai chapter hey chapter chapter chapter one the bible teaches in hege or hagai depending on how you'll pronounce it the bible says hagai chapter 2 we are in the book of hagai chapter 2 the bible says who amongst you saw the former house in its initial glory 1842 1844 and how do you see it now 2021 munao who can compare adventism 1840 to 1844 and now from 1888 to 2021 these are two different periods why because the foundation that was laid 1840 1844 at the foundation that was laid again during the time of reorganization are two different things now okay so my statement just one more time [Music] haggai is prophesying how god is going to shake the entire act so that the desire of nation jesus comes back to his temple the third time revelation 18 and that is the topic of tomorrow you see even if the house is inferior god still knows he must shake the heavens and the earth and the desire of nations christians the purpose of the fourth angel the purpose of the desire of nations to come back to his temple is to speak to the children of israel that they accept their foundations to be fit for the outcry of the tad angel selected messages book one page two or four one sm nini ko mi fanika page 204 okay paragraph one ninja fanica paragraph two one sm two four paragraph two selectors messages book one page two or four paragraph two skeletal the enemy of souls has sought to bring in the suppositions of it that a great reformation matanganeso was to take place among seventh-day adventists and that this reformation would consist in giving up the doctrines which stand as the pillars of our faith and engaging in a process of reorganization reorganization reorganization shikka your point wakati what um reorganization they have left the foundation and they cannot be fit for the loud cry of the third angel it means that god must raise a people to be fit for the louder of the third angels the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are we the temple of the lord the temple of the lord avi hawaii they engage in the process of reorganization why this reformation to take place what would result number one the principles of truth that god in his wisdom has given to the remnant church would be discarded our religion would be changed the fundamental principles that have sustained the work for the last 50 years would be accounted as error a new organization would be established shikha your point of visual a new organization seventh-day adventism worldwide church is operating under a new organization and by mccoy established books of a new order would be written a system of intellectual philosophy would be introduced the founders of this system would go into the cities and do a wonderful work the sabbath of course would be likely regarded as also the god who created it nothing would be allowed to stand in the way of this new movement chica your point the leaders who teach that virtue is better than vice but god being removed shekel your point god being removed they would place their dependence on human power which without god is worthless their foundation would be built on sand tonight matthew 7 24 and the storm and the tempest would sweep away the structure then she says who has an authority to be in such a movement we have our bibles we have our experience attested by the miraculous working of the holy spirit we have a truth that admits of no compromise shall living out repediate me to the iceberg there you are won't got track sequencer ana sema uh philadelphian experience revelation chapter 3 we go back there relation chapter 3 philadelphia experience we must put on christ's righteousness we must accept christ as the rock the foundation we must accept and go back to the foundational truths that christ placed in the time period of philadelphia that is the experience that is to give the loud cry now quotations are quotation okay skeleton let us first read philadelphia revelation chapter three the bible says in verses number eight behold i give thee those who are of the synagogue of satan so those who will go back to the philadelphia experience flock nataka spirit of prophet who are the synagogue of satan mana took akubali kurudi to the experience to the experience of philadelphia of obviously philadelphia experience word to the little flock word to the little flock wlfw lf uh let me just search it wlan wlf page 12 paragraph 2 fica pali page 12 paragraph 2 listen to what she says okay she says you think that those who worship before the saints feet revelation 3 9 will at last be saved for god showed me that this class were professed adventists okay these class were professed adventists who had fallen away and crucified themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame and in the hour of temptation sunderland crisis in the hour of temptation which is here to come to show out everyone's true character they will know that they are forever lost and overwhelmed with the anguish of spirit they will bow at the saints feet whether these are professed adventists how was he watching redeemed they cannot they cannot be in the lottery the loud cry they cannot partake of the righteousness of christ god cannot trust them with his message okay they had built upon timber and sands that is very unfortunate many shall come to me saying lord lord have we not eaten with you have we not done have you not done then christ will say to them away from me i never knew you that is how serious it is even if you live catechalia the lord came down to establish their faith upon an immovable rock an immovable rock amen amen amen amen amen amen reviewing herald okay amen now i'll read some few statements confirming the solid foundation that has been laid by god under the first second and third angel's message then we are going to close amen amen amen and i say maybe spiritual prophecy ana sema uh as the rock of aegis exclusivity the foundation is to be as the rock of ages uh the rock of aegis i think it's tomorrow manuscript releases manuscript releases are series uh now oh god bless amen amen this is called gcb general conference bulletin general conference bulletin of april 6 1906 1903 sorry of april 6 1903 paragraph 35 i'm repeating write this gcb general conference bulletin of april 6 1903 paragraph 35 she says the warning has come you see it begins with a warning i don't know those who are stepping off the foundation what they're thinking whatever truth god gave us between 1798 and 1844 when we step off that foundation debates will come in adventism debates so debates that is the purpose of god you are trying to show people the warning has come nothing is to be allowed to come in nothing is to be allowed to come in that will disturb the foundation of the faith upon which we have been building ever since the message came in 1842 1843 and in 1844 i was in this message i was in this message and ever since i have been standing before the world true to the light that god has given us amen we do not propose to take our feet off the platform on which they were placed as day by day we sought the lord with earnest prayer seeking for light skriza will anasema do you think that i could give up the light that god has given me it is to be asked the rock of ages amen it is to be asked the rock of ages those the foundational truths are the rock of ages it has been guiding me ever since it was given brethren and sisters god lives and reigns and works today his hand is on the wheel and his providence he is turning the wheel in accordance to his own will because those foundational truths are the rock of ages okay kamata the rock of ages god will qualify you to give the loud cry of the third angel that is why jeremiah says to his people jeremiah stand in the crossroads and see and ask the ancient parts where is the way okay okay if you remove the platform we are doing harm it is to be as the rock of ages the rock of ages the rock of ages amen amen amen amen amen the rock of ages so when god laid that foundation and funny enough in the philadelphia experience illinois says the mighty angel who is to unite with the third angel in the work of the loud crave the third angel is to unite with the third angel for the last work then she says the advent movement of 1842-44 was a glorious manifestation of the power of god people were united brethren they were united in the truth nobody was opposing the truth that god had laid so loud has fallen into deep apostasy and blindness because they have stepped up the platform one may talk about there is no other foundation that can be laid apart from that which has already been laid that which is christ himself the last of us we are ready tonight and i pray that you will consider these things even as we

that is the process number two whether he have sufficient funds to finish it lest happily after he had laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish so the god cannot use that formula of beginning a foundation allah foreign foundation god cannot use that formula believe me believe the bible god cannot

day\n[29.3s] this is day three\n[32.0s] of our presentations of our series\n[36.3s] trying to unlock the reason as to why\n[38.9s] there are debates\n[41.0s] in adventism today\n[52.7s] today we are going to look at a subject\n[55.5s] entitled\n[57.2s] 1840 to 1844\n[60.6s] the philadelphia and experience\n[63.3s] philadelphia and experience\n[77.5s] [Music]\n[90.8s] after the prayers we are

1844\n[145.4s] the philadelphian experience\n[148.5s] one of the reasons why we are to study\n[151.0s] the philadelphian experience\n[153.4s] is because\n[154.9s] there\n[189.4s] the first angel's message enters into\n[191.3s] history\n[192.3s] 1833 mila william miller ana zakuchambu\n[196.2s] and akusam of eighteen forty uh\n[199.9s] 1844\n[201.6s] that period of 46 years\n[204.6s] between

the platform\n[248.1s] and thought it was laid wrong so we want\n[250.5s] to look at the philadelphia experience\n[252.2s] to see what god did during the time\n[254.9s] period\n[255.8s] of the millerate advent movement\n[259.5s] revelation chapter two verses number\n[261.4s] nine\n[262.3s] biblionace\n[264.7s] verse eight nakamura kawakani lokko\n[314.3s] behold i give unto thee those who

god\n[336.8s] identifies\n[340.0s] the synagogue of satan\n[347.2s] 1840-1844\n[348.7s] is a powerful movement\n[361.4s] 1840 to 1844\n[363.8s] it's a great period that is linked\n[366.8s] to the loud

611\n[384.0s] uh paragraph one\n[386.6s] we are going to read uh this statement\n[390.3s] and then we are going to build great\n[392.2s] controversy page 611 gc\n[397.3s] page 611\n[401.0s] paragraph 1\n[405.4s] okay just a minute\n[407.0s] now when you read that chapter\n[409.4s] it's a powerful one\n[424.8s] is directing us concerning 1840 to 1844\n[428.6s] let us make that foundation first\n[431.5s] great controversy\n[434.1s] page 600 and eleven\n[437.4s] paragraph\n[439.4s] number one point one it says in a semi-v\n[444.5s] now i want you to listen\n[449.2s] great controversy\n[452.8s] page 611\n[454.8s] it says\n[458.7s] she says\n[460.2s] the angel who unites in the proclamation\n[463.0s] of the third angel's message\n[465.2s] is to lighten the whole earth with his\n[467.3s] glory now she begins in revelation\n[469.5s] chapter 18.\n[482.9s] a work of worldwide extent and unwanted\n[486.0s] power is here for told she begins by\n[489.0s] explaining what is coming\n[490.9s] in the future\n[492.8s] that is future a work of worldwide\n[495.1s] extend and unwanted power is here\n[498.1s] foretold\n[499.8s] then she continues\n[501.6s] the advent movement of 1840 to 1844 was\n[505.9s] a glorious manifestation of the power of\n[509.1s] god\n[510.1s] the first angel's message was carried to\n[512.2s] every missionary station in the world\n[514.5s] and in some countries there was the\n[516.4s] greatest religious interest which has\n[518.6s] been witnessed in any\n[520.6s] land since the reformation of the 16th\n[522.7s] century then she continues\n[524.9s] but these are to be exceeded by the\n[527.5s] mighty movement under the last warning\n[529.4s] of the third angel the work will be\n[531.4s] similar to that of the day of pentecost\n[534.2s] now look what the spiritual prophecy\n[535.8s] does\n[537.3s] she takes revelation chapter 18 the loud\n[539.7s] cry she links that to 1840 to 1844 then\n[544.2s] she concludes by pentecost three\n[546.8s] historic movements that are linked\n[549.3s] together and a letter movement start to\n[551.5s] ambassado\n[559.8s] movement in 1842 1844.\n[568.2s] experience\n[570.2s]

the foundation\n[3261.8s] some with rejoicing immediately stepped\n[3263.9s] upon it\n[3265.0s] others commenced to find the fold with\n[3267.4s] the foundation\n[3268.6s] they wished improvements made and then\n[3271.3s] the platform would be more perfect\n[3273.6s] and the people much happier some stepped\n[3276.3s] off the platform to examine it and\n[3278.8s] declared it to be laid\n[3281.6s] wrong\n[3292.7s] the foundation was laid wrong let's step\n[3295.1s] off the platform\n[3302.2s] listen\n[3304.3s] and the people must appear some step of\n[3306.5s] the platform to uh\n[3308.1s] to examine it and declared it to be laid\n[3311.3s] wrong but i saw that nearly all stood\n[3313.7s] upon the farm platform and exhorted\n[3316.6s] those who had stepped off to seize their\n[3319.8s] complaints for god was the master\n[3322.6s] builder and they were fighting against\n[3324.7s] him they recounted the wonderful work of\n[3327.0s] god which had led them to the

sand\n[3471.0s] it is built upon\n[3472.7s] timbus they have left the platform of\n[3475.7s] eternal truth 1798 to 1844 46 years\n[3489.0s] letter the first angel's message the\n[3490.4s] second

upon a solid\n[3531.7s] platform\n[3535.7s] let the truths that are the foundation\n[3538.3s] of our faith be kept before the people\n[3541.6s] some will depart from the faith giving\n[3544.6s] heed to seducing spirits and doctrines\n[3546.7s] of devils hajja say massam will depart\n[3548.9s] from the church\n[3555.4s] you can't be in the church but not in\n[3558.0s] the faith of the first second and third\n[3560.3s] angel you are not in the foundation and\n[3563.0s] this is a difference\n[3564.9s] that most adventists have never even\n[3567.1s] realized in pakistan\n[3573.2s] you see\n[3574.5s] you can't be in the church but outside\n[3577.0s] the faith\n[3578.3s] that's why paul says in second\n[3579.8s] corinthians thirteen verse one even\n[3581.4s] appalling\n[3584.0s] ana sema\n[3590.6s] ii corinthians chapter 13.\n[3593.8s] the bible says\n[3595.3s] verses number five\n[3597.4s] second corinthians 13 verse 5.\n[3600.7s] the bible says\n[3608.3s] yeah\n[3610.6s] test yourselves whether you be in the\n[3612.6s] faith not you've been the church you\n[3614.3s] can't be in the church but not in the\n[3615.7s] faith\n[3618.2s] that faith\n[3621.0s] that lays the foundations\n[3623.8s] okay\n[3625.0s] she says in cw 29.1 some will depart\n[3628.6s] from the faith giving heed to say this\n[3631.0s] in spirits and doctrines of devils\n[3634.2s] they talk science and the enemy comes in\n[3636.4s] and gives them an abundance of science\n[3639.3s] but it is not the science of salvation\n[3641.6s] it is not the science of humility of\n[3643.9s] concentration or of the sanctification\n[3646.6s] of the spirit\n[3647.9s] we are now to understand what the\n[3650.4s] pillars of our faith are\n[3652.8s] the truth that have made us as a people\n[3656.9s] what we are leading us on step\n[3660.9s] by step amen\n[3663.0s] amentopia review and herald of may 25\n[3666.5s] 1905.\n[3668.2s] that point is clear and that is why\n[3671.3s] unapologetic\n[3673.2s] let's go back to the bible\n[3675.0s] when the children of israel came out of\n[3677.0s] babylon\n[3678.6s] and they went to rebuild the foundation\n[3681.0s] okay\n[3683.7s] there's something that happened\n[3686.0s] very funny\n[3687.3s] you see when you begin to lay another\n[3688.7s] foundation it cannot be\n[3691.7s] powerful or perfect as the first\n[3694.1s] foundation that god laid i wish i can\n[3705.4s] let's go to the book of hagai\n[3709.4s] hagai\n[3721.8s] they cry why do they cry kuan nino\n[3724.8s] analia the reason is\n[3728.1s] they they look at these foundations\n[3729.8s] which are being led laid\n[3731.8s] out\n[3744.1s] and now let's go to haggai chapter\n[3747.4s] hey\n[3749.2s] chapter\n[3751.6s] chapter chapter one\n[3761.5s] the bible teaches in hege\n[3764.4s] or hagai\n[3766.0s] depending on how\n[3767.6s] you'll pronounce it\n[3775.7s] the bible says\n[3780.2s] hagai chapter 2\n[3785.0s] we are in the book of hagai chapter 2\n[3788.4s] the bible says\n[3826.3s] who amongst you saw the former house in\n[3829.8s] its initial glory\n[3831.7s] 1842 1844 and how do you see it now 2021\n[3836.5s] munao\n[3838.6s] who can compare adventism 1840 to 1844\n[3841.9s] and now\n[3843.0s] from 1888 to 2021 these are two\n[3846.4s] different periods\n[3848.1s] why\n[3849.1s] because the foundation that was laid\n[3850.8s] 1840 1844 at the foundation that was\n[3854.2s] laid again during the time of\n[3856.2s] reorganization\n[3857.9s] are two different things\n[3863.8s] now okay so my statement\n[3920.2s] just one more time\n[3938.3s] [Music]\n[3949.0s] haggai is prophesying how god is going\n[3951.2s] to shake the entire act so that the\n[3953.3s] desire of nation jesus comes back to his\n[3955.4s]

shake the heavens and the earth\n[3972.6s] and the desire of nations\n[3975.9s] christians\n[3998.3s] the purpose of the fourth angel the\n[4000.2s] purpose of the desire of nations to come\n[4002.4s] back to his temple\n[4004.5s] is to\n[4005.5s] speak to the children of israel\n[4008.2s] that they accept their foundations\n[4011.7s] to be fit for the outcry of the tad\n[4013.6s] angel\n[4032.6s]

        "timestamped_transcript": "[0.5s] in march the united nations released\n[2.2s] this report it said there were 107\n[4.7s] economies that face at least one of the\n[7.0s] three risks number one rising food\n[9.0s] prices number two rising energy prices\n[11.1s] and three tougher financial conditions\n[14.2s] 107 countries face these risks together\n[17.5s] they represent 1.7 billion people that's\n[20.2s] more than one-fifth of humanity\n[22.7s] there are 69 countries that face all the\n[25.1s] three risks food energy finance all\n[27.7s] three 69 countries could go the sri\n[30.2s] lanka way\n[31.5s] 25 in africa 25 in the asia pacific and\n[34.7s] 19 in latin america which countries are\n[36.8s] these we'll start with egypt the land of\n[39.0s] pharaohs it is in the throes of a\n[41.0s] financial crisis egypt is the world's\n[43.2s] largest importer of wheat russia and\n[45.4s] ukraine were its top suppliers as they\n[48.2s] fight now the supplies are running out\n[50.3s] last month egypt said that its wheat\n[52.4s] reserves will not last more than three\n[54.4s] months\n[55.6s] next we have tunisia the birthplace of\n[57.3s] the arab spring its economy is\n[58.8s] overheating foreign debt accounts for\n[61.3s] 100 of its gdp the trade deficit has\n[64.6s] widened to 800 million dollars inflation\n[67.5s] stands at seven percent fuel prices at\n[70.0s] record highs experts say tunisia could\n[72.6s] soon face civil unrest\n[75.2s] the same warning has been issued for\n[76.8s] lebanon the switzerland of west asia\n[79.0s] well not anymore in 2020 the beirut\n[81.2s] blasts destroyed lebanon's largest grain\n[84.8s] stores food prices went up by 11 times\n[89.1s] the lebanese pound lost 90 percent of\n[91.6s] its value public debt grew to 360\n[94.5s] percent of the gdp the war in ukraine\n[96.8s] complicated things further lebanon\n[98.8s] imported eighty percent of its wheat\n[100.3s] from ukraine those supplies have fallen\n[102.2s] there's a bread shortage a scarcity of\n[104.4s] sunflower oil lebanon has been forced to\n[106.9s] take a 150 million dollar loan from the\n[109.8s] world bank to ensure food security then\n[112.8s] we have argentina the land of tango also\n[115.7s] caught on the wrong foot now inflation\n[117.4s] is paralyzing its economy external debt\n[119.4s] is mounting argentina has defaulted on\n[121.3s] debt repayments nine times to avoid a\n[124.4s] tenth default it has gone to the imf it\n[127.1s] wants to refinance a 45 billion loan\n[131.3s] it may give argentina a brief reprieve\n[133.5s] but it will not quell the civil unrest\n[136.2s] analysts say argentina is staring at a\n[138.2s] long and cold winter this year\n[140.9s] some other latin american countries are\n[142.6s] also at risk like el salvador and peru\n[145.1s] they face hyper inflation in commodities\n[147.3s] stumbling bonds food shortages\n[149.6s] detonating prices and mass unemployment\n[152.8s] very much like sri lanka reports say\n[155.2s] both countries could soon face civil\n[156.9s] interest\n[157.9s] in sub-saharan africa ghana kenya south\n[160.8s] africa ethiopia could be the worst hit\n[163.8s] in ghana debt levels are soaring\n[165.4s] interest payments are choking the\n[166.6s] economy a debt crisis looks imminent in\n[169.1s] kenya the debt has climbed to 70 billion\n[171.4s] dollars at 70 percent of its gdp last\n[174.5s] week they got a 244 million dollar loan\n[177.3s] from the imf to weather this economic\n[179.4s] storm in south africa the debt has\n[181.5s] reached 80 percent of its gdp there's a\n[183.7s] looming threat of state collapse a\n[185.4s] re-run of the 2021 civil unrest\n[188.9s] next comes turkey the currency is\n[190.6s] sliding the debt is soaring upwards of\n[192.9s] 54 of the gdp inflation has touched 70\n[196.6s] percent gdp forecast cut to 3.3 percent\n[200.1s] there's a food shortage turkey is\n[202.2s] getting 50 000 tons of wheat from india\n[205.0s] and these were just a few examples\n[207.3s] the world bank says that in the next 12\n[209.7s] months as many as a dozen developing\n[212.2s] economies may not be able to service\n[214.4s] their debt\n[215.8s] this will be the largest debt crisis in\n[217.8s] a generation what about india it will\n[220.6s] feel the impact a few state economies\n[223.0s] are already inching towards a debt\n[224.9s] crisis in punjab west bengal bihar and\n[228.1s] andhra pradesh the debt to gdp ratio is\n[231.2s] identical to sri lanka's\n[233.8s] on the 3rd of april indian bureaucrats\n[235.7s] expressed concern they said populist\n[237.9s] measures in these states could ruin\n[239.4s] their economies and leave them broke\n[242.2s] like sri lanka\n[243.8s] now here's the thing the entire world is\n[245.8s] in debt distress national budgets are at\n[248.2s] breaking point some governments are\n[250.1s] being forced to cut spending others are\n[252.0s] borrowing more to stay afloat what

descend as rain that is the second time we'll see the bible giving us evidence that the holy spirit the manifestation of jesus himself his very life it is not a third personality to a god the holy spirit no it is the manifestation of jesus himself okay congratulations psalm 72 6. psalm 72 verse 6 psalm 72 6 and this is the greatest deception abayo says you see this is a deception of the highest order psalm 72 verse 6 in king james version psalm 72 verse 6 king james version says he referring to the king's son jesus he shall come down like rain upon the mount grass as showers that water there so who comes down as rain the spiritual reign the holy spirit it is jesus himself case closed we proceed we proceed so the bible teaches that aaron's road that murdered birding is caused by the latter rain when the showers begin and burning happens just before the harvest is now spiritual prophecy in one of the books he shall receive power receive power this is what ellen white says in this book called yrp is now connecting how the latter rain is to be revealed to god's people in these last i i can also read from another book because i've seen the same quotation in a book called uh we have so many compilations uh in the spirit of prophecy but uh for the purpose of record uh this is review and herald review and herald of april 21 1891 review and herald april 9 21 1891 paragraph 7 i think it says the latter rain is to fall upon the people of god for so a mighty angel is to come down from heaven and the whole earth is to be lighted with his glory are we ready to take part in the glorious work of the third angel there is a question so ellen white takes the latter rain and connects the latter in to the coming down of the mighty angel of revelation chapter 18. remember we are talking about the budding of aaron's road and how god will take forward his work from there hello it says the latter rain is to fall upon the people of god a mighty angel is to come down from heaven now this is revelation 18. we begin our series now let us begin our series because revelation 18 is the final laterin and la terrain revolves around that that fourth angel that angel is called the mighty angel that angel the fourth angel and by the way for your own information the fourth angel is the manifestation of the righteousness of christ himself let me build on this we are talking about the things that must transpire before jesus comes how the work of god must progress when the birding begins when the latter rain begins and this happens just before the harvest just before the harvest when god takes his own work in his own hands and there is a reason as to why god must do that we are reading from the book of habakkuk chapter 2 verse 14. habakkuk chapter 2 verses number 14. the bible says concerning revelation 18 the final budding the budding is caused by the latter rain aaron's road that budded is the final message to adventism before the harvest that they may read and understand how god's work is to be done in the last days god is to choose a leaders of his own heart to finish the work amen habakkuk chapter 2 verse 14. for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the waters fill the earth that is prophetic of revelation 18. revelation 18 shows how the mighty angel is to come down from heaven and by the way this mighty angel is christ himself because he is the one who is to initiate the budding and to choose the leaders in israel in these last days those whom he has appointed himself he must do that because kama yes so we cannot trust the leadership of this time among us god's people and there is a reason for that remember in the first session we are constantly on a combat the history of israel is a striking similarity of what adventism would be in the last days it is a striking similarity amen how let me just do a little recap because before we we tackle revelation 18 and show how the burden begins and then we go to history we show we show what what has happened we are in 2022. what has happened why is it there is much debating in adventism today on our foundational truths what is happening is it that god is taking his work to a next level and many do not realize like it happened in the jewish nation except you study the prophetic lines to understand these events let us progress the history of the israelites is the history of seventh-day adventism hosea chapter six micah chapter six verse four six verses number four maika chapter six verses number four the bible says biblionas for i brought thee up out of the land of egypt speaking of israel and i delivered thee from the house of bondage names and i sent forth moses haron and miriam to go before thee so israel as a nation they had three messengers to go before them it is only seventh day adventism that god has given us the fast angel's message revelation 14 verse six montgomery patriots moses patty at the second angel's message revelation 14 verse 8 haron god has given us the third angel's message miriam and it's so coincidence that cover miriam and ellen g white were both women they were both ladies it's very interesting because the rise of the third angel 1844 ellen g white is given the spirit of prophecy miriam but wait a minute they were not the messengers that took part in that very event of of taking the children of israel to the promised land it was joshua so joshua comes in as the fourth message and the fourth messenger revelation 18 is joshua the final attack on jericho i the babylon that must fall god's people must be prepared for that final work it must begin in israel israeli and joshua when joshua gets in by the way when joshua begins his work jesus himself speaks the bible says in the book of deuteronomy chapter number one deuteronomy chapter number one deuteronomy chapter number one bible says deuteronomy the bible says in the autonomy i and your money know most alien israeli water and hamburghani these are the ones that moses told the children of israel on the other side of the show of jordan and when moses had spoken those words of course he brought up joshua to take forth the bible continues to say joshua chapter number one joshua was told to be strong because the lord was going to be with him he should not fear uh the the reproach of the nations and even the israelites that is deuteronomy chapter one deuteronomy chapter two and after that moses dies and when we begin in the book of joshua we see the instructions given to joshua as plain and explicitly clear i want you to take the children of israel into the land of canaan the fourth message is the message that finishes the work this is the ministry of joshua the fourth angel revelation 18 that causes the burden and god must select leaders to guide his people you must elect god's leaders to guide these people back to go forth into there to the promised land into the promised land into the promised land now revelation 18 is the manifestation of jesus jesus himself manifests himself in the latter rain so the latter rain is the revelation that is a message that the bible teaches the latter rain is the manifestation of jesus rome takatifu when god pours forth his spirit he manifests he manifests his son christ jesus and his righteousness to his people that they may be prepared to stand in the trials that come but wait a minute is it true that jesus must come to try to awaken people that slumber in this in the ship yes and what is the purpose of the lottery what is the purpose of the burden remember who shall speak in behalf of israel god and to intervene god had to show openly through the body that this is the leader the tribe of levi i have chosen them because aaron's road has muttered let's go to matthew chapter 23 matthew chapter 23 jesus is the fourth messenger jesus is associated with number four remember the book of hosea says that hosea chapter 6 says is going forth is as the morning and it shall come to us as the rain as the as the latter rain when jesus revealed himself prophetically it is asked the morning good morning put that in your mind was this out here matthew 23 versus number 14 matthew 23 14 verse 23 matthew chapter 14 verses number 23 matthew chapter 14 verses number 23 the bible says when he had bid farewell to the to the multitudes ali panda murimani faraga nakuri when it was evening the ship was in the midst of the sea those who are looking at this prophetically we understand that the sheep is is is refers to the church that bears god's people the winds were blowing contrary so the ship was troubled in the midst of the sea that is what is happening to adventism because the sheep is being tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine every weed of doctrine the bible continues to say in a sema heart in the fourth watch of the night jesus revealed himself to them in the fourth watch the bible is specific it was the fourth watch of the night that jesus revealed himself and manifested himself to his people that were in the ship to try to bring back their faith they are being tossed to and fro to and fro by the winds of false doctrines there is much to fear from within than from without there is much to fear from within the doctrines that are beating around god's people many of them are from within god's people have lost an anchor the bible is specific it was the fourth watch of the night that jesus manifested himself now maybe we should ask the bible able to listen bibilia what is the name given to the fourth watch of the night because jose chapter 6 verse 3 says when jesus manifest himself to his people in the latter end he's going forth is us the morning morning now let's see what is the name given to the fourth watch of the night mark chapter 13 verse 35 mark chapter 13 verses number that five mark chapter 13 verses number that five we are reading from the book of mark marico cominato natano listen very carefully the bible says the fourth watch of the night has a name mark chapter 13 verse at five the bible says in mark 13 verse 35 this is not the second coming of jesus this is the manifestation of jesus to his people his house the church the four watches of the night let me read in english watch ye therefore for ye no not when the ma when the master of the house cometh at even at midnight or at coke growing or in the morning so the fourth watch of the night is called the morning so this is the time period prophetically when jesus manifested himself to his people in the lettering hosea chapter six verse three and he shall come to us as the latter in his going forth is us the morning it is the morning prophetically to begin to we proceed when jesus manifested his himself to the people who were in the sheep at the fourth watch of the night peter thought that they had seen a ghost that is what they thought the first fulfillment of when jesus wanted to manifest himself to his people the first fulfillment occurred in 1888 let us see whether ellen white writes the same let's see whether he writes this the very first attempt was in 1888 by the way i'm just reading last day events page 210 paragraph nine last day events last day events page 210 paragraph uh paragraph two last day vince page 210 paragraph paragraph number lde 210 paragraph 2. she says there is to be in the seventh day adventist churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of god you see it is the power of god so the holy spirit is the power of god i hear so many arguments people say the holy spirit cannot be the power of god the holy spirit is a separate person from the father and from jesus is the third being separate from the father and the son that is what adventism believes that is what the world teaches but that is not what the bible and the spirit of prophecy teaches elenor says there is to be in the seventh day adventist churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of god we can show this from the bible that the holy spirit is the power of god we can show it luke chapter 1 verse 35 it's the power of god so you cannot separate the power of god and put god aside and put his power aside and say that is god and that is another god no i also have some power i can lift some heavy some heavy gadget can you separate my power from myself no it cannot happen you need one always that is false that is deception of the highest order and that is why satan has brought in his deception the last apostasy omega of apostasy that began with the kellogg is here with us and many adventists have never realized that today luke chapter 1 verse 35 before i read last event concerning the power of god the holy spirit is the power of god luke chapter 1 verse 35 the holy spirit is not a third god called god the holy spirit separate from god separate from christ no no no no even wrong luke chapter 1 verse 35 luke chapter 1 verse 35 i'm just showing you i love in the universe of kundalini the bible's by the way it's very easy the bible is very easy to understand luke chapter 1 verse 35 and the angel told mary that the holy spirit shall descend upon thee and the power of the most high shall be upon you so the holy spirit is the power of the most high now is there a possibility that the power of the most high is a different person from god or from christ himself no that is not true the power of god who is the power of god look at the book of first corinthians chapter 1 verse 24 first corinthians chapter one first corinthians the bible says who is the power of god we've seen it's very interesting so unto those who are called the jews and the greeks it is christ the power of god so the latter name the holy spirit is the manifestation of the power of god christ jesus is the power of god and to his people amen the bible has has never been this clear before bibili that is a deception last lastly events page 2 10 paragraph 1 the bible uh spiritual prophet says there is to be in the seventh-day adventist churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of god who is being manifested it is christ himself the power of god but it will not move upon those who have not humbled themselves before the lord and open the door of the heart by confession and repentance listen to this now in the manifestation of that power which lightens the earth with the glory of god oh so that power must lighten the earth with the glory of god okay put that in mind they will see something which in their blindness they will think dangerous like villa me too they they were in the ship when they saw the manifestation of jesus in the fourth hour fourth watch of the night they saw something dangerous this is the history of adventism 1888 something which will arouse their fears and they will brace themselves to resist it because the law does not work in accordance to their ideas and expectations they will oppose the work why they say should we not know the spirit of god when we have been in the work for so many years the third angel's message will not be understood or comprehended the light which will lighten the earth with the glory of god will be called a false light by those who refuse to walk in its advancing glory let us put things together now this is the history of adventism in 1888 wakati mungualiwatuma juana mewavili e.j wagona and jonas wakatuli letter message righteousness by faith the revelation of the righteousness of jesus in the latter rain it was not the revelation of god the holy spirit it was the revelation of jesus himself now wait a minute she says in the manifestation of that power which lightens the earth with the glory of god the glory of god who lightens the earth with the glory of god by the way let us go to revelation 18 verse one able to saw me revelation how can people say the holy spirit is a third god called god the holy spirit well the bible is clear it is the manifestation of christ himself and his character to his people revelation 18 started working relation 18 by the way seventh day adventism is in a great delusion even of even how how to receive the lettering it is a great delusion that is why people can go to weeks of prayer expecting some power some other power apart from christ and the father himself that is not true revelation 18 verse 1. after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven ah having great glory the glory of god and he cried mightily with a loud voice let us go to john chapter 11 to show that this is jesus this is the fourth angel must come to show his glory let us see remember lazaro lazarus had been dead for four days i'll come across by the way yes the fourth day to show his glory he came to manifest his glory on the fourth day listen very carefully i'm just showing you line up online that revelation 18 is the manifestation of jesus himself not god the holy spirit it is christ himself jesus christ himself and if you cannot understand that it is christ himself you cannot give the first angels message correctly because already you are showing the world that you are worshiping a different god than the father and the son the bible is clear and this is life eternal that they might know you the only true god and jesus christ whom that was sent we were not told to know an attack being i took one beauty what it is a deception john chapter 11 verses john chapter 11. the bible says in verses number 17 it was the fourth day when jesus arrived let me jump the history i'm going straight to the point from verses number 39 yes this is the fourth day your friend has been dead yes welcome here did i not tell you mata that if you believe thou shalt see the glory of god jesus came to reveal the glory of god to those who were surrounding and to his friend who was dead he came the fourth day basically yes verse 43 is very key jesus is there on the fourth day he is manifested he wants to manifest the glory of god look at verse 43. [Music] he cried with a loud voice revelation 18 and the mighty angel cried with a loud voice that is jesus himself we are done we are done that is christ himself aaron's wrote that burden when jesus begins to manifest himself to his people the very first attempt maria consider 1888 1888 the very first attempt 1888 and the leadership of god's people rejected the message where is the fourth angel if the leaders rejected the message of righteousness by faith the manifestation of the character of jesus has it ever been accepted no the only condition by which that message and that power would be upon god's people is a confession of sin kutubudabi general conference president now um that is what the bible teaches in the book of hosea chapter 5 verse 15. let me show you something that has never happened by the way hosea then we'll go to malachi as we begin to bring this slightly to an end hosea chapter 5 verse 15 hosea chapter 5 verse 15 this is prophetic of what happened or transpired in 1888 kitumbacho kilifanika 1888 the fourth angel nita kwandazangu i will now go forth and return back to my place nakuparudiyamapang when there is to be a corporate confession of the scene of 1888 the angel can go back to the general conference but if that will never happen the general conference can never be the recipient of the spiritual power in the last days that is to prepare god's people for the loud cry and to stand in the last days that one we should put in our minds now yes and this is why we'll begin to see how aaron's road begins to blossom by the way in the book of malachi chapter number three there's a whole topic in the book deserve ages that is called in his temple remember psalms 132 says that god shall shall cause the budding of the horn in the house of david israel christ will manifest himself in the ring malachi chapter 3. malachi chapter number three the bible says in malachi chapter number three verses number one the first prophetic fulfillment of the arrival of christ in history the bible says and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple nam julem jumbo organo even the messenger of the covenant shall suddenly come to his temple the bible teaches that when jesus comes suddenly to his temple he shall sit as a refiner to refine his work will be to separate two classes of worshippers because he will come with power the very first fulfillment of this prophecy in his temple in afghanistan when jesus manifest himself the very first time to his people and this prophecy also can be connected with the prophecy of haggai chapter two chapter two and malachi chapter three due to ezekiel letter these prophetic lines pamoja remember this is the second part he'll come to kudua the purpose of this presentation is to let the people know the work of god in the final portion of this earth history in a fanika tv how does the work of god go forward in in a country again does god depend on the leadership that has apostatized will god use them anymore or will god show through the budding of the aaron's road that he has selected a new leadership for his people in the times of the body let's go to hagai hagai hagai the book of haggai chapter number two hagiai the book of hagiai hagiai chapter number two it depends on where you come from some people say hey some people say haggai hagai chapter 2 the bible says that the lord will suddenly come to his temple but who shall stand because when he cometh to his temple he is like a refiner he separates two classes of worshippers whether we are conscious or whether we are not conscious depending on whether we have received the light or whether we have rejected the light of the budding the burden forth the very message that jesus wants us to understand in these last days again chapter 2 this is a message that is very key speak unto the remnant of the children of israel saying amongst you who is left that saw this house in its initial glory adventism we are living in 2022. who saw adventism in 1840 1844 who saw it 1840-1844 is there anyone amongst us was there alive no we are the children of our father's faith israel who saw this house in its initial glory it was just powerful when god had laid the foundational truths and how do you see today we're going to answer the questions as we progress be a strong serum why is it that the lord is saying that they should be strong i'm reading verse 8. it says look at this versus number seven god will do something in israel when the burden begins when the prophecy of psalms chapter 132 begins to fulfill when when the burden when that horn wakati pembe israeli maria this is the first time before jesus comes back in revelation chapter 18 in the manifestation of that power of god the very first time is when jesus is born in bethlehem and is raised amongst his people and goes to his temple physically to his temple this is the very first time of the fulfillment of the prophecy of malachi chapter 3 and haggai chapter 2. the bible says the bible says and i will shake the the entire world the nations and the desire of nation shall come and i will fill this house with the glory of god amen the desire of ages is jesus before he comes there must be a shaking of the entire earth the message of his coming must shake the earth and that is why in the times of herod wakati herod the whole of jerusalem was troubled with the message because the message was coming from the east and the magaya uh they did not know the time of their visitation they did not know that god is coming to take his work to another level two classes of worshippers will develop those who will continue to stand firm in the platform that jesus stood pla farm for because jesus was the foundation of the jewish economy yes so jesus was coming back to manifest himself for the very first time and this is the purpose of the lettering even in the last days look at what spirit of prophet says she says look at this it says in the book called let me let me see this book uh i want to show you what jesus came to do his his very own revelation she says desire of ages page 288 listen very carefully desire of ages chapter 29 this is page 218 888 she says the savior had not come to set aside what the patriarchs and the prophets had spoken that was the foundation for he himself had spoken through these representative men all the truths of god's word came forth from him but these priceless gems had been placed in false settings their precious light had been made to minister to era while coming by you'll see your moonwale god desired them to be removed from their settings of error he had desired that israel be removed from their setting of error and and had replaced them with the framework he came to replace those errors in the framework of truth this work only a divine hand could accomplish by its connection with the error the truth had been serving the cause of the enemy god and of god and man christ had come to place it where it would glorify god and work the salvation of humanity amen eras that is the very essence of the lettering because the latter rain is the manifestation of jesus when jesus begins to bring the truth the leaders cannot accept the truth because the foundational truth thou jesus must begin another work he must begin a new work and let the blind leaders the blind guides to continue to think that they are the temple of god yes what our channel they rejected the truth the sun henry that is the history of the lattering it begins with the fss it goes forward to philadelphia by the way these three churches are very important when we study the history of the birding of aaron's road la zima to do history revelation chapter 18 he's only saying that the manifestation of the character of god to set back the foundational truths and to begin a work that many people will not understand let us let us read desire of aegis 232. when the latter rain begins jesus must take a new direction look at what happens in in israel when jesus manifestation manifested manifested the glory of god when he manifested the glory of god okay look at what happened look at what happened these are wages deserve ages desired of ages page 232. without wages page 200 and number 32 listen let's give zuri 232 paragraph one she says she says if the leaders in israel had received christ he would have honored them as his messengers to carry the gospel to the world at assassination allowed to cry we must have the burden jesus must be manifested again to his people fast fast but the message first goes to the leaders in israel if they had accepted christ if they had accepted the glory of god if they had accepted the angel of revelation 18 in a nutshell she says god would have honored them as his people to take the gospel to the world she says to them first was given the opportunity to become heralds of the kingdom of grace of god but israel knew not the time of her visitation the jealousy and distrust of the jewish leaders had ripened into open hatred and the hearts of the people were turned away from jesus so the leaders had the problem they did not want to go back to their foundational truths they do not want to accept the message that jesus had brought up that is the purpose of the to to put aside error and to cause the people of god to stand on the platform of eternal truth look at what happened sikhi aquititum the sun henry had rejected christ's message and was bent upon his death walitaka okay therefore jesus departed from jerusalem muji from the priests vyongoziwadini from the temple mariam bapu mung gariquanaka the religious leaders the people who had been instructed in the law and returned to another class to proclaim his message god had begun to collect a people that he can use to take his message while the leaders continued to think that they were still god's chosen messengers what a deception what a deception jesus went to gather out those who should carry the gospel to all nations listen now as we bring this for close listen very closely as the light and life of man was rejected jesus is the light and the life of men the holy spirit gives the life of jesus so the holy spirit again is the life of christ it is not god the holy spirit somebody separate and distinct from jesus it is the very life and the very nature of jesus himself that is what the spiritual prophet says yes as the light and life of man was rejected by the ecclesiastical authorities in the days of christ so it has been rejected in every succeeding generation tuna be upper again and again the history of christ's withdrawal from judea has been repeated when the reformers preach the word of god the foundational truth because the reformers have accepted that jesus is the foundation they have accepted not error but the truth they have accepted to return the people back to the platform of eternal truth they had no thought of separating themselves from the established church leaders would not tolerate the light and those who had the light were forced to seek another class who are longing for the truth in our day few of the prophets followers of the reformers are actuated by their own spirit few are listening for the voice of god are ready and ready to accept the truth and whatsoever guys it may be presented in reformers conference churches ambassador our next topic will be tackling what is the church canis aninini is the general conference they church we will begin by tackling the history of the latter rain and the fourth angel and we are going to understand what the church is and how god is to finish the work in the last days what would you want to say jesus sought another class he left the priest he left jerusalem he left the temple he left the religious leaders matthew chapter 13 verse 15. yes i kept let them alone that is matthew chapter 15 verse 13. iron throat that burden we have seen so far that when jesus manifest himself he manifests himself in the holy spirit to reveal the glory of god to his people so that god's people may be established in their foundational truths when we come to part three we are going to move forward to 1888 from 1888 2022 where is the fourth angel has jesus manifested himself to us today is the work of god taking a different dimension what work are we supposed to support in the last days how will we know that the work of god has taken a different dimension god bless you amina",

now\n[777.4s] you know\n[788.5s] the king's son jesus himself shall\n[791.2s] descend as rain\n[793.8s] that is the second time we'll see the\n[795.5s] bible giving us evidence that the holy\n[797.9s] spirit the manifestation of jesus\n[799.9s] himself his very life\n[802.2s] it is not a third personality to a god\n[804.3s] the holy spirit no it is the\n[806.2s] manifestation of jesus

shall come down like rain\n[845.8s] upon the mount grass as showers that\n[848.6s] water there\n[849.8s] so who comes down as rain the spiritual\n[852.5s] reign the holy spirit it is jesus\n[854.5s] himself case closed we proceed\n[858.9s] we proceed\n[860.2s] so the bible teaches that aaron's road\n[862.3s] that murdered birding is caused by the\n[864.4s] latter rain\n[865.5s] when the showers begin and burning\n[868.2s] happens just before the harvest\n[877.9s] is\n[884.0s] now\n[885.5s] spiritual prophecy\n[888.2s] in\n[889.0s] one of the books\n[892.3s] he shall receive power\n[898.0s] receive power\n[902.5s] this is what ellen white\n[906.2s] says\n[908.2s] in this book called yrp\n[916.2s] is now connecting\n[918.0s] how the latter rain\n[919.8s] is to be\n[920.9s] revealed to god's people\n[923.4s] in these last\n[925.8s] i i can also read from another book\n[927.8s] because i've seen the same quotation\n[930.5s] in a book called uh\n[941.4s] we have so many compilations\n[944.4s] uh in the spirit of prophecy\n[947.6s] but uh for the purpose of record\n[951.6s] uh this is review and herald\n[954.4s] review and herald of april 21 1891\n[959.8s] review and herald\n[961.7s] april 9 21 1891\n[964.7s] paragraph 7 i think it says\n[967.6s] the latter rain is to fall upon the\n[969.4s] people of god\n[970.9s] for so\n[972.0s] a mighty angel is to come down from\n[974.2s] heaven and the whole earth is to be\n[976.2s] lighted with his glory are we ready to\n[978.7s] take part in the glorious work of the\n[980.4s] third angel there is a question\n[982.6s] so ellen white\n[984.6s] takes the latter rain and connects the\n[987.0s] latter in to the coming down of the\n[989.1s] mighty angel of revelation chapter 18.\n[991.6s] remember we are talking about the\n[993.0s] budding\n[994.2s] of aaron's road and how god will take\n[996.8s] forward his work from there\n[1003.3s] hello it says\n[1005.4s] the latter rain is to fall upon the\n[1006.9s] people of god a mighty angel is to come\n[1009.5s] down from heaven now this is revelation\n[1011.3s] 18. we begin our series now\n[1014.5s] let us begin our series because\n[1016.3s] revelation 18 is the final laterin\n[1019.9s] and la terrain\n[1021.3s] revolves around that that fourth angel\n[1025.1s] that angel is called the mighty angel\n[1028.0s] that angel the fourth angel and by the\n[1030.7s] way\n[1031.9s] for your own information\n[1035.4s] the fourth angel is the manifestation of\n[1037.9s] the righteousness of christ himself\n[1041.0s] let me build on this\n[1045.0s] we are talking about\n[1047.7s] the things that must transpire before\n[1049.7s] jesus comes\n[1051.1s] how the work of god must progress\n[1054.0s] when the birding begins when the latter\n[1056.6s] rain begins\n[1057.8s] and this happens just before the harvest\n[1060.6s] just before the harvest\n[1063.1s] when god\n[1064.3s] takes his own work in his own hands and\n[1066.4s] there is a reason as to why\n[1068.2s] god must do that\n[1077.0s] we are reading\n[1079.0s] from the book of\n[1080.9s] habakkuk chapter 2 verse 14.\n[1084.3s] habakkuk chapter 2\n[1087.4s] verses number 14.\n[1094.6s] the bible says concerning revelation 18\n[1098.2s] the final budding\n[1100.2s] the budding is caused by the latter rain\n[1102.8s] aaron's road that budded\n[1105.6s] is the final message to adventism before\n[1108.6s] the harvest\n[1109.8s] that they may read and understand how\n[1112.3s] god's work is to be done in the last\n[1114.1s] days\n[1115.5s] god is to choose a leaders\n[1118.2s] of his own heart\n[1119.9s] to finish the work amen\n[1122.4s] habakkuk chapter 2 verse 14.\n[1131.0s] for the earth shall be filled with the\n[1132.9s] knowledge of the glory of the lord as\n[1134.9s] the waters fill the earth\n[1137.0s] that is prophetic of revelation 18.\n[1139.6s] revelation 18 shows how\n[1142.7s] the mighty angel is to come down from\n[1144.4s] heaven\n[1145.5s] and by the way this mighty angel is\n[1147.5s] christ himself because he is the one who\n[1149.6s] is to initiate the budding and to choose\n[1152.3s] the leaders in israel in these last days\n[1155.5s] those whom he has appointed himself he\n[1158.3s] must do that because kama yes\n[1162.8s] so\n[1164.9s] we cannot trust the leadership of this\n[1167.4s] time\n[1168.2s] among us god's people and there is a\n[1169.8s] reason for that\n[1171.0s] remember in the first session\n[1173.9s] we are constantly on a combat the\n[1175.7s] history of israel is a striking\n[1178.6s] similarity of what adventism would be in\n[1181.2s] the last days it is a striking\n[1183.0s] similarity\n[1184.3s] amen\n[1185.5s] how\n[1187.4s] let me just do a little recap because\n[1189.8s] before we we tackle revelation 18 and\n[1192.1s] show how the burden begins and then we\n[1194.1s] go to history we show\n[1196.1s] we show what what has happened we are in\n[1198.5s] 2022. what has happened why is it there\n[1201.0s] is much debating in adventism today on\n[1204.1s] our foundational truths what is\n[1205.6s] happening\n[1206.6s] is it that god is taking his work to a\n[1208.2s] next level and many do not realize\n[1211.6s] like it happened in the jewish nation\n[1219.0s] except you study the prophetic lines to\n[1221.0s] understand these events\n[1222.7s] let us progress\n[1225.1s] the history of the israelites is the\n[1227.0s] history of seventh-day adventism hosea\n[1229.8s] chapter six\n[1231.4s] micah chapter six verse four\n[1236.3s] six verses number four\n[1239.4s] maika chapter six verses number four\n[1243.0s] the bible says biblionas\n[1249.0s] for i brought thee up out of the land of\n[1252.1s] egypt speaking of israel\n[1257.4s] and i delivered thee from the house of\n[1259.1s] bondage\n[1260.4s] names\n[1265.7s] and i sent forth moses haron and miriam\n[1269.7s] to go before thee\n[1271.4s] so israel as a nation they had three\n[1273.4s] messengers\n[1274.5s] to go before them it is only seventh day\n[1276.5s] adventism\n[1277.7s] that god has given us the fast angel's\n[1280.2s] message revelation 14 verse six\n[1282.2s] montgomery patriots\n[1284.2s] moses\n[1285.9s] patty at the second angel's message\n[1287.5s] revelation 14 verse 8 haron\n[1290.8s] god has given us the third angel's\n[1292.6s] message\n[1293.9s] miriam\n[1295.3s] and it's so coincidence that cover\n[1297.0s] miriam\n[1298.4s] and ellen g white were both women they\n[1301.1s] were both ladies\n[1303.0s] it's very interesting because the rise\n[1305.0s] of the third angel 1844 ellen g white\n[1308.2s] is given the spirit of prophecy\n[1313.9s] miriam\n[1315.1s] but wait a minute\n[1331.8s] they were not the messengers that took\n[1334.3s] part in that very event\n[1337.1s] of of taking the children of israel\n[1340.6s] to the promised land it was joshua so\n[1343.0s] joshua comes in as the fourth message\n[1346.5s] and the fourth messenger revelation 18\n[1349.8s] is joshua the final attack on jericho i\n[1354.0s] the babylon that must fall\n[1356.5s] god's people must be prepared for that\n[1358.6s] final work it must begin in israel\n[1362.2s] israeli and joshua when joshua gets in\n[1365.4s] by the way\n[1367.5s] when joshua begins his work\n[1370.0s] jesus himself speaks\n[1372.2s] the bible says in the book of\n[1374.2s] deuteronomy chapter number one\n[1376.9s] deuteronomy chapter number one\n[1381.2s] deuteronomy chapter number one\n[1385.4s] bible says deuteronomy\n[1393.3s] the bible says in the autonomy\n[1396.8s] i and your money know most alien israeli\n[1399.0s] water and hamburghani these are the ones\n[1400.8s] that moses told the children of israel\n[1403.6s] on the other side of the show of jordan\n[1407.0s] and when moses had spoken those words of\n[1408.8s] course he brought up joshua to take\n[1411.0s] forth\n[1414.6s] the bible continues to say\n[1418.4s] joshua chapter number one\n[1423.8s] joshua was told to be strong\n[1427.4s] because the lord was going to be with\n[1429.7s] him\n[1431.2s] he should not fear\n[1433.6s] uh the the reproach\n[1436.0s] of the nations\n[1437.7s] and even the israelites that is\n[1439.0s] deuteronomy chapter one\n[1441.2s] deuteronomy chapter two\n[1443.8s] and\n[1445.1s] after that moses dies and when we begin\n[1447.6s] in the book of joshua we see the\n[1449.7s] instructions given to joshua as plain\n[1452.4s] and explicitly clear\n[1477.8s] i want you to take the children of\n[1479.8s] israel into the land of canaan the\n[1481.6s] fourth message\n[1483.3s] is the message that finishes the work\n[1486.1s] this is the ministry of joshua\n[1488.5s] the fourth angel revelation 18 that\n[1490.5s] causes the burden and god must select\n[1493.5s] leaders to guide his people\n[1498.6s] you must elect god's leaders\n[1501.9s] to guide these people back\n[1504.5s] to go forth into there\n[1506.3s] to the promised land\n[1508.5s] into the promised land\n[1511.3s] into the promised land now\n[1513.4s] revelation 18\n[1515.0s] is the manifestation of jesus jesus\n[1517.0s] himself\n[1519.1s] manifests himself in the latter rain so\n[1521.4s] the latter rain is the revelation\n[1527.1s] that is a message that the bible teaches\n[1529.3s] the latter rain is the manifestation of\n[1531.0s] jesus\n[1532.1s] rome takatifu when god pours forth his\n[1534.4s] spirit\n[1535.4s] he manifests he manifests\n[1538.8s] his son\n[1540.1s] christ jesus and his righteousness\n[1542.4s] to his people that they may be prepared\n[1544.4s] to stand\n[1545.6s] in the trials that come but wait a\n[1548.0s] minute\n[1552.3s] is it true\n[1553.5s] that jesus must come\n[1556.3s] to try to awaken people that slumber in\n[1558.9s] this in the ship\n[1560.6s] yes\n[1562.5s] and what is the purpose of the lottery\n[1565.4s] what is the purpose of the burden\n[1568.9s] remember\n[1578.1s] who shall speak\n[1579.8s] in behalf of israel\n[1583.0s] god and to intervene god had to show\n[1585.4s] openly through the body\n[1587.4s] that this is the leader the tribe of\n[1589.5s] levi i have chosen them\n[1592.2s] because aaron's road has muttered\n[1595.8s] let's go to matthew chapter 23\n[1598.9s] matthew chapter 23\n[1601.1s] jesus is the fourth messenger jesus is\n[1603.2s] associated with number four\n[1605.1s] remember the book of hosea says\n[1608.6s] that\n[1609.6s] hosea chapter 6 says\n[1611.6s] is going forth\n[1613.4s] is\n[1614.7s] as the morning and it shall come to us\n[1617.1s] as the rain as the as the latter rain\n[1620.5s] when jesus revealed himself\n[1622.3s] prophetically it is asked the morning\n[1625.1s] good morning\n[1626.6s] put that in your mind was this out here\n[1631.1s] matthew 23\n[1633.0s] versus number 14\n[1635.7s] matthew 23\n[1653.3s] 14 verse 23\n[1655.0s] matthew chapter 14\n[1657.0s] verses number 23\n[1659.4s] matthew chapter 14\n[1661.3s] verses number 23 the bible says\n[1666.2s] when he had bid farewell to the to the\n[1668.5s] multitudes ali panda murimani\n[1671.1s] faraga\n[1673.0s] nakuri\n[1674.3s] when it was evening\n[1680.7s] the ship was in the midst of the sea\n[1683.2s] those who are looking at this\n[1684.5s] prophetically we understand that the\n[1686.3s] sheep is is is refers to the church that\n[1690.2s] bears god's people\n[1703.3s] the winds were blowing contrary so the\n[1705.8s] ship was troubled in the midst of the\n[1707.4s] sea that is what is happening to\n[1709.5s] adventism\n[1710.9s] because the sheep is being tossed to and\n[1712.5s] fro\n[1713.7s] by every wind of doctrine\n[1715.9s] every weed of doctrine\n[1718.4s] the bible continues to say\n[1721.4s] in a sema\n[1722.7s] heart\n[1730.4s] in the fourth watch of the night jesus\n[1733.0s] revealed himself to them\n[1735.9s] in the fourth watch the bible is\n[1738.7s] specific\n[1739.8s] it was the fourth watch of the night\n[1742.4s] that jesus revealed himself and\n[1744.8s] manifested himself to his people that\n[1747.4s] were in the ship to try to bring back\n[1749.4s] their faith\n[1752.2s] they are being tossed to and fro\n[1755.0s] to and fro by the winds of false\n[1756.7s] doctrines\n[1757.9s] there is much to fear from within than\n[1759.8s] from without\n[1761.6s] there is much to fear from within the\n[1763.2s] doctrines\n[1764.7s] that are beating around god's people\n[1768.6s] many of them are from within god's\n[1770.6s] people\n[1771.4s] have lost an anchor\n[1774.2s] the bible is specific it was the fourth\n[1776.5s] watch of the night\n[1778.2s] that jesus manifested himself\n[1780.6s] now maybe we should ask the bible able\n[1782.6s] to listen bibilia what is the name given\n[1786.2s] to the fourth watch of the night\n[1791.1s] because jose chapter 6 verse 3 says when\n[1793.4s] jesus manifest himself to his people in\n[1795.5s] the latter end he's going forth is us\n[1798.8s] the morning\n[1801.2s] morning\n[1806.9s] now let's see what is the name given to\n[1809.3s] the fourth watch of the night\n[1812.2s] mark chapter 13 verse 35\n[1815.6s] mark chapter 13\n[1817.6s] verses number that five\n[1820.6s] mark chapter 13\n[1822.9s] verses number that five\n[1825.9s] we are reading from the book of mark\n[1829.1s] marico cominato\n[1835.4s] natano\n[1837.3s] listen very carefully\n[1839.2s] the bible says\n[1841.1s] the fourth watch of the night\n[1843.4s] has a name\n[1845.5s] mark chapter 13 verse at five\n[1849.4s] the bible says in mark 13 verse 35\n[1860.4s] this is not the second coming of jesus\n[1862.8s] this is the manifestation of jesus to\n[1864.6s] his people his house\n[1867.7s] the church\n[1882.3s] the four watches of the night let me\n[1884.3s] read in english\n[1887.2s] watch ye therefore for ye no not when\n[1890.1s] the ma when the master of the house\n[1891.9s] cometh\n[1893.0s] at even\n[1895.0s] at midnight\n[1896.8s] or at coke growing\n[1899.0s] or in the morning so the fourth watch of\n[1901.0s] the night is called the morning\n[1902.8s] so this is the time period prophetically\n[1904.9s] when jesus manifested\n[1906.6s] himself to his people in the lettering\n[1909.9s] hosea chapter six verse three\n[1912.4s] and he shall come to us as the latter in\n[1915.1s] his going forth is\n[1917.6s] us the morning\n[1919.2s] it is the morning prophetically\n[1922.2s] to begin to\n[1924.9s] we proceed\n[1928.5s] when jesus manifested his himself to the\n[1931.1s] people who were in the sheep\n[1933.6s] at\n[1935.9s] the fourth watch of the night\n[1937.9s] peter thought that they had seen a ghost\n[1941.6s] that is what they thought\n[1943.7s] the first fulfillment of when jesus\n[1947.6s] wanted to manifest himself to his people\n[1950.6s] the first fulfillment\n[1953.0s] occurred in 1888\n[1955.5s] let us see whether ellen white writes\n[1957.6s] the same\n[1958.6s] let's see whether he writes this the\n[1960.3s] very first attempt was in 1888\n[1964.3s] by the way\n[1965.5s] i'm just reading last day events page\n[1967.1s] 210\n[1968.2s] paragraph nine\n[1971.1s] last day events\n[1974.2s] last day events\n[1977.7s] page 210\n[1981.7s] paragraph\n[1984.2s] uh paragraph two\n[1987.7s] last day vince\n[1990.4s] page 210\n[1993.5s] paragraph\n[1996.2s] paragraph number\n[2000.8s] lde 210 paragraph 2.\n[2004.7s] she says\n[2006.9s] there is to be in the seventh day\n[2008.2s] adventist churches a wonderful\n[2009.8s] manifestation of the power of god\n[2012.9s] you see it is the power of god\n[2015.3s] so the holy spirit is the power of god\n[2019.0s] i hear so many arguments people say the\n[2021.3s] holy spirit cannot be the power of god\n[2023.6s] the holy spirit\n[2025.0s] is a separate person from the father\n[2027.5s] and from jesus is the third being\n[2030.5s] separate from the father and the son\n[2034.3s] that is what adventism believes that is\n[2036.2s] what the world teaches but that is not\n[2038.4s] what the bible and the spirit of\n[2039.6s] prophecy teaches\n[2041.6s] elenor says\n[2043.2s] there is to be in the seventh day\n[2045.0s] adventist churches a wonderful\n[2046.7s] manifestation of the power\n[2049.1s] of god\n[2051.0s] we can show this from the bible that the\n[2052.6s] holy spirit is the power of god we can\n[2054.2s] show it luke chapter 1 verse 35\n[2057.3s] it's the power of god so you cannot\n[2059.3s] separate the power of god\n[2061.1s] and put god aside and put his power\n[2063.8s] aside and say that is god\n[2066.1s] and that is another god no\n[2068.8s] i also have some power i can lift some\n[2071.0s] heavy some heavy gadget\n[2073.5s] can you separate my power from myself no\n[2075.8s] it cannot happen you need one\n[2078.0s] always\n[2081.2s] that is false that is deception of the\n[2085.0s] highest order and that is why satan has\n[2088.1s] brought in his deception\n[2090.5s] the last apostasy omega of apostasy that\n[2094.2s] began with the kellogg is here with us\n[2097.4s] and many adventists have never realized\n[2099.4s] that today luke chapter 1 verse 35\n[2101.8s] before i read last event\n[2103.6s] concerning the power of god\n[2105.4s] the holy spirit is\n[2107.4s] the power of god\n[2109.8s] luke chapter 1 verse 35\n[2112.9s] the holy spirit is not a third god\n[2115.1s] called god the holy spirit separate from\n[2117.8s] god separate from christ no no no no\n[2120.2s] even wrong\n[2122.2s] luke chapter 1 verse 35\n[2125.2s] luke chapter 1 verse 35\n[2128.2s] i'm just

the power of the most high\n[2165.4s] now is there a possibility that the\n[2167.0s] power of the most high is a different\n[2168.5s] person from god or from christ himself\n[2172.2s] no that is not true\n[2174.1s] the power of god\n[2176.1s] who is the power of god\n[2177.8s] look at the book of first corinthians\n[2179.4s] chapter 1 verse 24\n[2182.0s] first corinthians chapter one\n[2186.4s]

no\n[2701.8s] the only condition by which\n[2703.6s] that message and that power would be\n[2705.9s] upon god's people is a confession of sin\n[2709.1s] kutubudabi general conference

back to the general\n[2778.3s] conference\n[2779.9s] but if that will never happen\n[2782.0s] the general conference can never be the\n[2783.7s] recipient\n[2784.9s] of the spiritual power in the last days\n[2787.1s] that is to prepare god's people for the\n[2789.2s] loud cry and to stand in the last days\n[2792.2s] that one we should put in our minds\n[2797.0s] now\n[2798.1s] yes\n[2801.9s] and

classes of worshippers\n[2938.7s] because he will come with power\n[2941.0s] the very first fulfillment of this\n[2942.6s] prophecy in his temple in afghanistan\n[2953.7s] when jesus manifest himself the very\n[2955.4s] first time to his people and this\n[2957.4s] prophecy\n[2960.0s] also can be connected with the prophecy\n[2962.1s] of haggai chapter two\n[2965.8s] chapter two and malachi chapter three\n[2967.5s] due to ezekiel letter these prophetic\n[2969.4s] lines pamoja remember this is the second\n[2971.8s] part\n[2972.8s] he'll come to kudua the purpose of this\n[2975.5s] presentation is

stand\n[3046.5s] because when he cometh to his temple\n[3049.4s] he is like a refiner he separates two\n[3052.2s] classes of worshippers whether we are\n[3053.8s] conscious\n[3055.1s] or whether we are not conscious\n[3056.5s] depending on whether we have received\n[3058.6s] the light or whether we have rejected\n[3061.0s] the light of the budding\n[3063.0s] the burden forth\n[3065.4s] the very message\n[3067.0s] that jesus wants us to understand\n[3070.0s] in these last days\n[3073.0s] again chapter 2\n[3077.7s] this is a message\n[3079.4s] that is very key\n[3106.4s] speak unto the remnant\n[3108.5s] of the children of israel saying\n[3115.3s] amongst you who is left that saw this\n[3118.5s] house in its initial glory\n[3122.4s] adventism we are living in 2022. who

faith\n[3142.2s] israel who saw this house in its initial\n[3145.5s] glory it was just powerful\n[3149.8s] when god had laid the foundational\n[3151.5s] truths\n[3156.2s] and how do you see today we're going to\n[3158.5s] answer the questions as we progress\n[3162.7s] be a strong serum\n[3172.4s] why is it that the lord is saying that\n[3174.8s] they should be strong\n[3176.4s] i'm reading verse 8.\n[3179.2s] it says\n[3180.5s] look at this\n[3182.2s] versus number seven\n[3184.8s] god will do something\n[3187.5s] in israel when the burden begins\n[3191.2s] when the prophecy of psalms chapter 132\n[3193.2s] begins to fulfill\n[3194.7s] when when the burden when that horn\n[3197.5s] wakati pembe\n[3201.8s] israeli maria\n[3203.2s] this is the first time\n[3205.2s] before jesus comes back in revelation\n[3207.3s] chapter 18 in the manifestation of that\n[3209.8s] power of god the very first time is when\n[3212.6s] jesus is born in bethlehem and is raised\n[3215.2s] amongst his people and goes to his\n[3217.2s] temple physically\n[3219.4s] to his temple this is the very first\n[3221.2s] time of the fulfillment of the prophecy\n[3223.3s] of malachi chapter 3 and haggai chapter\n[3225.4s] 2. the bible says\n[3238.6s] the bible says and i will shake the the\n[3241.4s] entire world the nations\n[3243.7s] and the desire of nation shall come\n[3246.6s] and i will fill this house with the\n[3248.6s] glory of god amen\n[3251.6s] the desire of ages is jesus before he\n[3254.0s] comes there must be a shaking of the\n[3255.9s] entire earth the message of his coming\n[3258.5s] must shake the earth and that is why in\n[3260.6s] the times of herod wakati herod\n[3265.1s] the whole of jerusalem was troubled with\n[3267.2s] the message because the message was\n[3269.0s] coming from the east\n[3271.1s] and the magaya\n[3272.8s] uh\n[3280.6s] they did not know the time of their\n[3282.2s] visitation\n[3283.4s] they did not know that god is coming to\n[3285.4s] take his work\n[3286.8s] to another level\n[3290.0s] two classes of worshippers will develop\n[3293.0s] those who will continue to stand firm in\n[3296.1s] the platform that jesus stood pla farm\n[3298.7s] for\n[3300.3s] because jesus was the foundation of the\n[3302.8s] jewish economy yes\n[3310.4s] so jesus was coming back\n[3313.5s] to manifest himself for the very first\n[3315.4s] time and this is the purpose of the\n[3316.8s] lettering even in the last days look at\n[3319.0s] what spirit of prophet says\n[3325.6s] she says\n[3327.3s] look at this\n[3334.2s] it says in the book called\n[3336.9s] let me let me see this book\n[3340.0s] uh\n[3342.5s] i want to show you what jesus came to do\n[3345.6s] his his very own revelation\n[3356.2s] she says\n[3357.4s] desire of ages\n[3359.1s] page 288\n[3361.2s] listen very carefully\n[3364.7s] desire of ages\n[3366.8s] chapter 29\n[3368.6s] this is page 218 888\n[3372.2s] she says\n[3374.1s] the savior had not come to set aside\n[3376.3s] what the patriarchs and the prophets had\n[3378.2s] spoken that was the foundation\n[3381.3s] for he himself had spoken through these\n[3383.3s] representative men\n[3385.4s] all the truths of god's word came forth\n[3388.7s] from him but these priceless gems had\n[3392.7s] been placed in false settings\n[3410.2s] their precious light had been made to\n[3412.4s] minister to era\n[3414.0s] while coming\n[3416.2s] by you'll see your moonwale\n[3418.2s] god desired them to be removed from\n[3420.9s] their settings of error\n[3425.1s] he had desired that israel be removed\n[3428.8s] from their setting of error and\n[3439.8s] and had replaced them\n[3441.9s] with the framework\n[3443.4s] he came to replace those errors\n[3445.8s] in the framework of truth\n[3448.0s] this work only a divine hand could\n[3451.1s] accomplish\n[3452.4s] by its connection with the error the\n[3454.5s] truth had been serving the cause of the\n[3456.4s] enemy god and of god and man\n[3459.4s] christ had come to place it where it\n[3461.7s] would glorify god and work the salvation\n[3464.8s] of humanity amen\n[3469.3s] eras\n[3474.2s] that is the very essence of the\n[3475.8s] lettering because the latter rain is the\n[3477.8s] manifestation of jesus when jesus begins\n[3480.6s] to bring the truth\n[3482.4s] the leaders cannot accept the truth\n[3485.2s] because\n[3486.6s] the foundational truth thou\n[3488.8s] jesus must begin another work he must\n[3491.2s] begin a new work and let the blind\n[3494.9s] leaders the blind guides to continue to\n[3497.8s] think that they are the temple of god\n[3500.0s] yes what our channel\n[3508.6s] they rejected the truth the sun henry\n[3512.0s] that is the history of the lattering it\n[3514.6s] begins with the fss\n[3516.6s] it goes forward to philadelphia\n[3521.8s] by the way these three churches are very\n[3523.8s] important when we study the history of\n[3525.8s] the birding of aaron's road la zima to\n[3528.6s] do history\n[3543.0s] revelation chapter 18 he's only saying\n[3545.0s] that the manifestation of the character\n[3547.1s] of god to set back the foundational\n[3549.5s] truths and to begin a work\n[3552.6s] that many people will not understand let\n[3554.8s] us let us read desire of aegis 232.\n[3558.8s] when the latter rain begins\n[3561.0s] jesus must take a new direction look at\n[3563.8s] what happens\n[3565.0s] in in israel when jesus manifestation\n[3567.9s] manifested manifested the glory of god\n[3571.8s] when he manifested the glory of god\n[3574.6s] okay\n[3575.9s] look at what happened\n[3578.2s] look at what happened\n[3580.6s] these are wages\n[3584.4s] deserve ages\n[3588.2s] desired of ages page 232.\n[3593.0s] without wages\n[3601.7s] page 200\n[3604.2s] and number 32\n[3607.0s] listen\n[3608.4s] let's give zuri 232 paragraph one she\n[3610.6s] says\n[3614.5s] she says\n[3616.3s] if the leaders in israel had received\n[3618.3s] christ\n[3619.3s] he would have honored them as his\n[3620.8s] messengers to carry the gospel to the\n[3622.4s] world at assassination allowed to cry\n[3625.3s] we must have the burden jesus must be\n[3627.4s] manifested again to his people fast\n[3631.1s] fast\n[3632.6s] but the message first goes to the\n[3634.5s] leaders in israel\n[3636.8s] if they had accepted christ if they had\n[3639.4s] accepted the glory of god if they had\n[3642.5s] accepted the angel of revelation 18\n[3646.3s] in a nutshell\n[3648.3s] she says\n[3650.2s] god would have honored them as his\n[3652.0s] people\n[3653.2s] to take the gospel to the world\n[3656.6s] she says\n[3658.3s] to them first was given the opportunity\n[3660.2s] to become heralds of the kingdom of\n[3661.8s] grace of god\n[3663.4s] but israel knew not the time of her\n[3667.0s] visitation\n[3668.4s] the jealousy and distrust of the jewish\n[3671.8s] leaders had ripened into open hatred\n[3676.1s] and the hearts of the people were turned\n[3678.2s] away from jesus so the leaders had the\n[3680.5s] problem they did not want to go back to\n[3682.7s] their foundational truths\n[3684.4s] they do not want to accept the message\n[3686.0s] that jesus had brought\n[3687.7s] up\n[3695.1s] that is the purpose of the\n[3697.8s] to to put aside error and to cause the\n[3700.6s] people of god to stand on the platform\n[3702.5s] of eternal truth\n[3704.6s] look at what happened sikhi aquititum\n[3708.5s] the sun henry\n[3710.9s] had rejected christ's message\n[3713.4s] and was bent upon his death walitaka\n[3717.0s] okay\n[3718.2s] therefore jesus departed from jerusalem\n[3723.2s] muji\n[3724.3s] from the priests vyongoziwadini\n[3727.8s] from the temple mariam bapu mung\n[3729.8s] gariquanaka the religious leaders the\n[3733.0s] people who had been instructed in the\n[3734.8s] law and returned to another class to\n[3738.4s] proclaim his message\n[3741.1s] god had begun to collect a people\n[3745.4s] that he can use to take his message\n[3748.4s] while the leaders continued to think\n[3751.0s] that they were still god's chosen\n[3752.7s] messengers what a deception\n[3755.7s] what a deception\n[3758.1s] jesus went to gather out those who\n[3760.2s] should carry the gospel to all nations\n[3762.2s] listen now\n[3763.4s] as we bring this for close listen very\n[3765.1s] closely\n[3766.2s] as the light and life of man was\n[3768.8s] rejected\n[3770.6s] jesus is the light\n[3772.2s] and the life of men\n[3773.6s] the holy spirit gives the life of jesus\n[3776.3s] so the holy spirit again is the life of\n[3778.8s] christ it is not god the holy spirit\n[3781.4s] somebody separate and distinct from\n[3783.2s] jesus it is the very life and the very\n[3785.6s] nature of jesus himself that is what the\n[3787.8s] spiritual prophet says\n[3791.8s] yes\n[3792.8s] as the light and life of man was\n[3795.3s] rejected\n[3796.6s] by the ecclesiastical authorities in the\n[3799.0s] days of christ so it has been rejected\n[3802.6s] in every succeeding generation tuna be\n[3805.8s] upper\n[3822.7s] again and again the history of christ's\n[3825.3s] withdrawal from judea has been repeated\n[3828.8s] when the reformers preach the word of\n[3830.6s] god the foundational truth because the\n[3833.2s] reformers have accepted that jesus is\n[3836.4s] the foundation they have accepted not\n[3839.8s] error but the truth they have accepted\n[3842.6s] to return the people back to the\n[3844.1s] platform of eternal truth\n[3847.4s] they had no thought of separating\n[3849.0s] themselves from the established church\n[3879.0s] leaders would not tolerate the light and\n[3881.1s] those who had the light were forced to\n[3883.2s] seek another class who are longing for\n[3885.4s] the truth in our day\n[3887.5s] few of the prophets followers of the\n[3889.4s] reformers are actuated by their own\n[3891.6s] spirit few are listening for the voice\n[3895.0s] of god are ready and ready to accept the\n[3897.8s] truth and whatsoever guys it may be\n[3900.6s] presented\n[3903.0s] in reformers\n[3905.0s] conference churches ambassador\n[3913.5s] our next topic will be tackling what is\n[3916.6s] the church canis aninini\n[3919.8s] is the general conference they church\n[3922.3s] we will begin by tackling the history of\n[3924.2s] the latter rain and the fourth angel\n[3926.9s] and we are going to understand what the\n[3928.6s] church is and how god is to finish the\n[3931.4s] work in the last days\n[3933.5s] what would you want to say\n[3959.4s] jesus sought another class he left the\n[3962.2s] priest he left jerusalem he left the\n[3965.0s] temple he left the religious leaders\n[3967.5s] matthew chapter 13 verse 15.\n[3969.9s] yes\n[3976.8s] i kept\n[3979.7s] let them alone\n[3981.0s] that is matthew chapter 15 verse 13.\n[3985.8s] iron throat that burden\n[3988.0s] we have seen so far\n[3989.9s] that when jesus manifest himself\n[3992.6s] he manifests himself in the holy spirit\n[3994.4s] to reveal the glory of god to his people\n[3996.7s] so that god's people may be established\n[3999.8s] in their foundational truths\n[4005.3s] when we come to part three\n[4007.1s] we are going to move forward to 1888\n[4010.2s] from 1888 2022 where is the fourth angel\n[4014.7s] has jesus manifested himself to us today\n[4018.7s] is the work of god taking a different\n[4020.2s] dimension\n[4022.7s] what work\n[4024.0s] are we supposed to support in the last\n[4025.7s] days\n[4048.6s] how will we know that the work of god\n[4051.3s] has taken a different dimension god\n[4053.2s] bless you\n[4101.1s] amina"

it's our\n[294.6s] first trial but I'm sure the consequent\n[303.2s] consequent uh ones should be a bit\n[307.4s] sucessful so we're going to use a cheese\n[309.4s] cloth or a sheer\n[312.2s] cloth and um somewhere where we can\n[315.4s] extract the oil into a dish or something\n[321.6s] then you scoop\n[323.0s] our avocados little by little\n[327.0s] [Music]\n[332.0s] yes we hopeful to get as

to the manner in which god's work is being carried forward in these last days because there are very many notions among us god's people watu among konami zamot of aouti kusiyanankazi yamungo kippendi misho as we continue to tackle this series what does it symbolize we have seen already that the birding is caused by the latter rain and the latter rain must only begin in the closing scenes of this earth's history india in this third part we are going to look at the second coming of christ in the history we are not talking of the second appearing of jesus in the clouds of heaven that glorious appearance is uh or rain is the manifestation of christ and his righteousness to his own people and uh the book of malacca malachi to ambition john the baptist is the messenger that prepares the way for the manifestation of christ to his people yes yes it is because of the burden the burden is the revelation of jesus nick chapter 27 verses number six isaiah chapter 27 verses number six museum the birding king james version i saw 27 versus number six the prophetic parallels of the bible you can never understand what kind of work is taking place right now in this art history what's it called isaiah 27 6 the bible says he shall cause them that come of jacob to take root israel shall blossom and bird and fill the face of the whole world with the fruit israeli itachi the horn of salvation samsung 32-17 allah psalms 132 verses number 17 psalms 132 verses number 17. there will i make the horn of david too bad i have ordained a lamp for my mind anointed is the messenger that is to prepare the way for the burden in israel yes amen we have that wonderful topic that is called in his temple when jesus arrived physically for the very first time for the very first time to bring light now the purpose of jesus coming to israel was to put down errors the rubbish of errors that have been heaping for generations and to replace back the truth in the framework of truth singing but what happened the leaders in israel could not tolerate the light and we are told in the pain of inspiration dessert of ages page 200 and 32 desire of ages page 200 and 332 and i say maybe listen carefully this is history that repeats in every succeeding generations whenever jesus will be revealed again yes because right now we are going to the military to see when the birding began again wakati machipu the same history was being repeated she says if the leaders in his israel had received christ he would have honored them as his messengers to carry the gospel to the world to them first was given the opportunity to become heralds of the kingdom of grace of god but israel knew not the time of her visitation the jealousy and distrust of the jewish leaders had opened it ripened had ripened into open hatred at the hearts of the people were turned away from jesus the sun henry yong goziwadini kosovo they had rejected christ's message and was bent upon his death therefore shikaya points to india we are taught therefore jesus departed from jerusalem jesus the presence of jesus was no longer in jerusalem he departed from jerusalem number one number two from the priests young ghost wadding number three from the temple hekalo number four the religious leaders the people who had been instructed in the law and turned to another class to proclaim his message and to gather out those who should carry the gospel to all nations luke chapter 6 verse 12. they have rejected the foundation of the jewish economy jesus was the foundation jesus came to bring back the truth to those who would have accepted them like anyway pinga luke chapter six versus number twelve lucas emma lucas coomba aka kesha we have the title of the of a wonderful topic that is called the ordained twelfth jesus began to obtain the twelve to establish his church what we had the religious leaders the temple services and jesus began to ordain a ministry to carry for the work those who would accept his message remember those who accepted the message of john the baptist accepted christ those who accepted the second message with christ as the light and life of man was rejected by the ecclesiastical authorities in the day in the days of christ so it has been rejected in every succeeding generation again and again the history of christ withdrawal from judea has been repeated they had no thought of separating themselves from the established but the religious leaders would not tolerate the light and those who had the light were forced to seek another class who were longing for the truth in our day few of the professed followers of the reformers are actuated by the spirit in a minute the bible says history must repeat and the pain of inspiration says that history of jesus withdrawing from judea will be repeated to the close of time now let's go to the second history to megalith of israel we will be revisiting that history as we move forward now let's go back to malachi chapter three to angola yes by the way malachi says the lord whom you suddenly seek shall come to his temple the first temple was in jerusalem now we are looking at the second temple before we look at the second temple maybe let's look at the book of joel chapter 2 verse 23 it will form the basis of understanding how many times rain has fallen in the uh in this earth history before jesus returns back for his people joel chapter 2 verse 23 joel chapter 2 joel chapter 2 and rejoice in the lord your god for he had given you the former reign moderately at me only and he will cause to calm down for you the rain involved the rain the rain the the former rain the rain of the latter the former rain the rain and the la terrain is three let us repeat the book of malachi we want to establish the three reigns in the history the first one begins at pentecost the last one is in our time period in the time period of revelation 18 the loud cry of the third angel where we repeat again the bible says behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me jesus speaking and the lord whom you will and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in behold he shall come save the lord of hosts but who may abide in the day of his coming and you shall stand when he appear it for he is like the refiners fire and like the fuller soap and they shall sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold silver that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness jesus will begin to separate two classes of worshippers depending on those who have accepted the whole truth their foundational truths or those who have rejected two classes of worshippers now when does this happen then a second time we go to the history of the philadelphian church revelation chapter 10 the second time that jesus appears to his people yes philadelphia is the great advent millerite movement and i want to show you from the pane of inspiration great controversy you read first the book of great controversy she says great controversy great controversy great controversy she says she she she merges three histories and a letter is to riha tatu zawat to a she says great controversy 6 11. great under the topic the final warning abusive villain if you cannot understand the prophetic parallels you will never understand god's work in the last days that is why there's a lot of trouble in adventism today or people have failed to understand the prophetic parallels of the bible and the spirit of prophecy look at this listen very carefully she says great controversy 6 11. the angel who unites in the proclamation of the third angel's message is to lighten the art with his glory future revelation 18 revelation 18 the final outpouring of the holy spirit in the lottery she begins with that final movement a work of worldwide extent and unwanted power is here for told also listen to where she goes next secure my liana power and elia go to formula and i say maybe the advent movement of 1840 to 1844 was a glorious manifestation of the power of god the first angel's message was carried to every missionary station in the world and in some countries there were the greatest religious interests which has been witnessed in any land since the reformation of the 16th century but these are to be far exceeded by the mighty movement by the mighty movement under the last warning of the third angel there is to be a mighty movement and at the last warning amazon at the mighty movement revelation 18 and rudy 18 40 to 1844. there was also a glorious manifestation of the power of god the holy spirit was powered the ring now she goes back now the work will be similar to that

that speak with me john says when john saw jesus his feet were asked the burning furnace that is revelation chapter 10 the angel that descended his feet were as pillars of fire that furnace that burnt that was jesus himself and spiritual prophecy also shows that it was christ it was the manifestation of jesus great controversy 6 11 says the advent movement of 1840 to 1844 was a glorious

less a personage than jesus christ setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot upon the dry line it shows the part which he is acting in the closing scenes of the great controversy with satan this position denotes his supreme power and authority over the old earth so it was jesus who descended okay yes in that movement having that little book of daniel abaya kofunua now revelation chapter 10 is very interesting listen very carefully remember malachi chapter 3 says before the messenger of the covenant is revealed there is always a messenger that is to prepare the people listen grace

to preach the first angels message wakati william miller alianza copianos because he was the messenger of the messenger that was prepared the people mila took the position of john the baptist listen very carefully schizophrenia is about she says i saw that god was in the proclamation of the time in 1843 it was designed it was his design to arouse the people and bring them to a testing point where they should decide for or against the truth listen very carefully in the time of jesus wakati movement people had to decide for or against the truth two classes of worshippers look at the times of miller himself god had designed that that movement be raised when jesus descended august 11 1840 wakati there was rain listen very carefully listen very carefully listen very carefully i wanted to listen very carefully what happened she continued saying ministers laid aside their secretarian sectarian views and feelings and united in proclaiming the coming of jesus wherever the message was given it moved the people sinners repented wept and prayed for forgiveness and those who survived lives had been marked with dishonesty were anxious to make restitutions parents felt the deepest solicitude for their children those who received the message labored with their unconverted for their unconverted friends and relatives and with their souls bowed with the weight of the solemn message warned and entreated them to prepare for the coming of the son of man those cases were most hardened that would not yield to such a weight of evidence set home by heartfelt warnings anasema one led to embrace the truth preached by miller william and servants of god who are raised up in the spirit and power of elijah to proclaim the message like john the forerunner of jesus those who preached this holy message felt compelled to lay the axe at the root of the tree and call upon men to bring forth fruits meat for repentance [Music] movement i'm buying it with the great advent nailerite movement full stop able to anglia kamakuna two classes of worshippers and they embraced the truth that miller and his associates were proclaiming in the time period of 1840 to 1844. abu tahangali what led to the movement of 1840-1844 look at this uh great controversy great controversy uh great controversy page 335 controversy page 335 she says in the year 1840 another remarkable fulfillment of prophecy excited a widespread interest two years before miya kamivili kabbalah josiah leach one of the leading ministers preaching the second advent published an exposition of revelation chapter nine predicting the fall of the ottoman empire and specifying not only the year but the very day on which this would take place according to his exposition management accounting the ottoman empire italian goku according to his exposition which was purely a matter of calculation and on the prophetic periods of scripture the turkish government would surrender its independence on the eleventh day of august 1840. chica your point 11 of august 1840 the prediction was widely published and thousands watched the course of events with eager interest at the very time specified turkey through her ambassadors accepted the protection of the allied powers of europe and thus placed herself under the control of christian nations uni great controversy tonight the event exactly fulfilled the prediction when it became known multitudes were convinced of the correctness of the prophetic principles in term of interpretation adopted by miller and his associates and a wonderful power a wonderful impetus was given to the advent movement men of learning and position united with miller both in preaching and publishing his views and from 1840 to 1844 the work rapidly extended william miller possessed a strong mental power governing eighteen forty to eighteen forty four able to anglican yesterday there was a separation of classes of when jesus left the temple the synagogue the priests the people he began a ministry a movement a movement that was to be free of errors a movement that was to be free from human dogmas to to prepare the people for the ali rain pentecost look at what happened during the times of of william was it a history repeat yes it says great controversy page 375 paragraph one grace controversy we are reading the book great controversy uh let me begin by great controversy three eight point one she says listen carefully she says great controversy 379 and 380 paragraph number three 379.3 great controversy search for the blessed results experienced by those who accepted the advent message they came from different denominations and their denominational barriers were held instead of following the truth people will be clinging to their denomination and their denominational dogmas while the voice is crying into the wilderness a voice will be crying into the wild from the wilderness to prepare way for the second coming of christ people will be leaving their denominations to join the remnant to stand in the platform of eternal truth we'll come to part 4 and 5 of the same message listen very carefully they came from different denominations and the denominational barriers were held to the ground conflicting creeds were shivered to atoms creed the unscriptural hope of the temporal millennium was abandoned false views of the second advents were corrected pride conformity to the world was swept away wrongs were made right hearts were united in swedish fellowship and love and joy reigned supreme in this doctrine did this if this doctrine did this for the few who did receive it it would have done the same for all if if all had received it but the churches generally did not accept the warning mechanism unto the house of israel should have been the first to decide to discern the tokens of jesus's coming had failed to learn the truth either from the testimony of the prophets or from the signs of the times ativiangosiwadini they had failed to learn the truth either from the testimony of the prophets or from the signs of the times as worldly hopes and ambitions filled the hearts love for god and faith in his word had grown cold and when the advent doctrines was was presented it only arouse their prejudice and unbelief because god was bringing back the foundational truths god was bringing additional light mongolian letters the fact that the message was to a great extent preached by laymen was argued as an instrument against it preachers see your theologians go preachers in every part of god's history god's work lay men are always the people that have been chosen of god to carry the message they are not proud when the message comes they will accept it they have no certificates to show that they have studied were the ones that were used by god to proclaim the message in the times of miller and layman they had accepted the message the times of jesus it was the same it was the same jesus told the pharisees that i tell you uh let me read matthew chapter 8 matthew 8. matthew chapter number eight let me see the bible says uh what says number matthew chapter 8 verses number 11. she says speaking of the centurion of bible says i say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of truth at one hour to point a wakati what wenge why she says the bible says uh because they have they had accepted the truth readily let me read in uh matthew yes yes chapter 11 from verse 16 but i but where and too shall i liken this generation nitapan anisha kizaziki nanini it is like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling unto their fellows and saying we have piped unto you and you have not danced we have moaned unto you and you have not lamented verse 18. for john came neither eating and drinking and they say he had the devil i only wanted me the son of man came neither eating nor drinking they came eating and drinking and they said behold a man glut on us and one bible and a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified in our children she says ah verse 25 and at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou has heed these things from the wise and the prudent and has revealed them unto babes on a masters in theology nikon a doctorate in philosophy in in in in religion because of their their their wisdom they want to embarrass the fact that this message was to a greater extent preached by laymen was an argument against it you'll see jimbo queen and so it will be today in the times of miller when that angel descended when there was rain the first angels message again there was a separation of worshippers those who took the message the bible says revelation chapter 10 verse 10. shall that message was sweet god was gathering a people to give the message in the last days and now to napoleon de leon that is the history that must repeat illinois says again and again the history of christ withdrawal from judea has been repeated when the reformers we must understand that history very well so that we may be able to stand on the platform of truth on the platform of eternal truth we have established that there was rain in the time of the milarites in the time of the milorites we have established to me the angel the messenger of the covenant was christ himself descended william miller took the position of john the baptist again and now as we progress i want to show that the different denominations did not accept the message of miller the different denominations we are reading tuna summer uh kitab we need to uh uh live sketches this is live sketches of james white and ellen g white live sketches of ellen white ls page 27 the advent course in portland maine in june of 1842 mr miller gave his second course of lectures at the casco street church in portland i felt it a great privilege this is ellen white to attend these lectures because people who are coming out of the various denominations we're going to finish our creeds we're going to talk about water william put these things in mind even as we move with history because the same history is going to repeat again she says for i had fallen under discouragement i did not prepare to meet my savior this second course created much more excitement in the city than the first with few exceptions the different denominations closed the doors of their churches against miller did not do that mila went to seek for another class who would obey the truth and he established places of worship what like in the times of jesus she says in desire of ages 232 paragraph 1 that when jesus left the temple the religious leaders a people in whom was given the message he went to another class those who rejoiced in the truth yes self-supporting ministries independent churches on assembly offices they don't even they they don't even understand the definition of a church people think that their denominations made that is a fatal deception even the jewish nation the jewish leaders by the way jesus left the structures jesus left the priest jesus left the temple and jesus went to another class how do you define the church is the church the structure is the church the denominational priests no the church cannot be those who have rejected the truth the church is always and will always be those who advance in the light and those who remain in their foundational truths those who follow the light where it is that is always the church that is the church manuscript releases volume 17. listen to this nissan general conference okay general conferences are posterized and small the church is not babylon which church which church is not babylon is it the general conference that is uniting with the prophecy that is that has formed a new organization do you still call that the church or what is your definition of a church what is your definition of a church because the church cannot fall the the church will remain there are tears and wheat in the near compare tears and wheat has has to do with apostasy tears and weeds has to do with sins not up not open apostasy open up posters apostasy has nothing to do with the tears and wheat being in the church

scenes character nashanga watch on a quote spiritual prophecy i am afraid there are tears and wheat in the church which church what is the definition of a church is the church that group of people in open apostasy from their truth or is the church the group of individuals who have accepted to follow on the lord and to remain in their foundational truths amidst them they are wheat and tears 17 mr these are the things we are going to put in record straight as we continue with this presentation it is no that is not true 17 mr 81.4 she says god has a church in the last days god has a church it is not the great cathedral neither is it the various denominations canis it is the people who love god and keep his commandments where two or three are gathered together in my name there i am in the midst of them where christ is even among us the humble few this is christ's church for the presence of the high and the lofty one alone that inhabited eternity can alone constitute a chat you can see me quest why do you even have as we move forward to look at the last history in our time period we are going to look carefully because aaron's road is too bad in the time period when jesus is still in the most holy place by the way listen very carefully as we bring this rock to a close revelation chapter 10 and revelation chapter 18 is the same angel by the way revelation chapter 10 and revelation chapter 18 is the same angel revelation chapter 10 and revelation chapter 18 they are both mighty angels revelation chapter 10 the mighty angel revelation chapter 18 the mighty angel revelation chapter 10 the revelation chapter 18 that mighty angel cries with a loud voice it is the manifestation of christ himself now as we come to our time period look at this something that adventists many adventists have never realized that when the latter end begins in our time period we go back to malachi chapter 3 that the messenger of the covenant must prepare people to to for the revelation of jesus to come suddenly to his temple maybe as we introduce revelation chapter 18 we have seen that the very first attempt when god attempted to bring revelation chapter 18 the latter in loud cry was in 1888 that is the final time their final attempt their final work of god revelation 18 when that work begins two classes of worshippers again there are those who will establish themselves in the in their foundational truths they are those who are going to reject they are those who are going to stick to their denominations they are those who are going to follow christ the voice that will be crying the wilderness there are those who are going to be establishing god's people in the foundational truths there are those who are going to reject their truths two classes of worshipers you must understand where you belong when that work begins officially by the way israel is let us go to jeremiah chapter 3 and see how this happened jeremiah number fifteen when aaron's road budded god declared plainly the kind of leaders that he had chosen himself jeremiah chapter three verses number thirteen jeremiah chapter 3 jeremiah chapter 3 verses number 13 jeremiah 3 verses number 13 jeremiah chapter 3 verses number 10 the bible says so and repent and accept that thou has apostasized children that have apostasized this is a plea that god is saying that is the first message that god gives his children those who have apostasized from the truth that is was what israel had done returning return eo backsliding children listen very carefully to um let me read in english jeremiah

and two of a family and i will bring you unto zion verse 15 and i will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding this is prophetic there is a time period in history when god brings pastors whom he has chosen himself when the burden begins god chooses leaders those who have rejected the truth they will never know when god is choosing leaders to direct his people they will never understand when miller began his work and when god began to bring people out of the denomination of churches when people began to preach the first angels message when god began to establish leaders to feed people with the present truth the churches did not know the pharisees did not know and so it will be today the churches will not know including those who have said that they are god's people they will not know wakati muchipuko tanza when god will be selecting leaders leaders who are qualified by the spirit of god leaders who have accepted the truth god will empower his people to begin the work in israel return back to your foundational truths all backsliding children rudini katika missing go back to the foundational truth the first second and third

aftermath of 1888 he says and i could not let the resolution pass that there was to be special light for god's people as they neared the closing scenes of this earth's history special light another angel was to come down from heaven with a message and the whole earth was to be lighted with his glory it would be impossible for us to state just how this additional light would come it might come in a very unexpected manner in a way that would not agree with the ideas that many have conceived it is not all unlikely or contrary to the ways and works of god to send light to his people in unexpected ways we are coming back to revelation 18 we began with jesus coming to his temple in the times of the jewish nation two classes of worship us we went to the millerite experience the philadelphian church miller and his associates two classes of worshippers we are coming to tackle revelation 18 nasa to king part four part five we are coming to understand things how they are we are going to plainly speak of the spirit of prophecy and how god wants us to understand what constitutes his church is to fall upon god's people a mighty angel is to come down from heaven that is revelation chapter 18 when it begins god is to take his work to another level many will not understand the great debates will begin in adventism when the birding begins and god chooses leaders to feed his people with the truth and the pure truth we thank you for these messages bless us till the next presentation bless everyone now to bariki arjuna yes amen son",

religious leaders the temple\n[691.6s] services and jesus began to ordain\n[695.0s] a ministry to carry for the work those\n[697.7s] who would accept his message remember\n[700.9s] those who accepted the message of john\n[702.5s] the baptist accepted christ those who\n[705.3s] accepted the second message with christ\n[738.8s] as the light and life of man was\n[740.4s] rejected by the ecclesiastical\n[742.1s] authorities in the day in the days of\n[743.7s] christ\n[751.4s] so it has been rejected in every\n[754.9s] succeeding generation\n[761.8s] again and again\n[763.3s] the history of christ withdrawal from\n[765.4s] judea has been repeated\n[794.6s] they had no thought\n[796.2s] of separating themselves from the\n[798.6s] established\n[816.2s] but the religious leaders would not\n[818.1s] tolerate the light and those who had the\n[820.9s] light were forced to seek another class\n[823.1s] who were longing for the truth in our\n[825.3s] day\n[826.1s] few of the

they came from different denominations\n[2504.6s] and their denominational barriers were\n[2506.9s] held\n[2531.8s] instead of following the truth people\n[2534.8s] will be clinging to their

message\n[2798.1s] they are not proud\n[2801.4s] when the message comes they will accept\n[2803.0s] it\n[2804.6s] they have no certificates to show that\n[2806.6s] they have studied\n[2829.0s] were the ones that were used by god to\n[2831.1s] proclaim the message in the times of\n[2833.0s] miller and layman\n[2841.0s] they had accepted the message\n[2852.1s] the times of jesus\n[2854.1s] it was

because of their\n[3061.8s] their their wisdom\n[3065.3s] they want to embarrass\n[3068.2s] the fact that this message\n[3070.6s] was to a greater extent\n[3073.4s] preached by laymen\n[3075.8s] was an argument against it you'll see\n[3078.6s] jimbo queen\n[3080.4s] and so it will be today in the times of\n[3083.0s] miller\n[3084.0s] when that angel descended when there was\n[3086.5s] rain\n[3093.6s] the first angels message\n[3095.5s] again there was a separation of\n[3096.9s] worshippers\n[3120.7s] those who took the message\n[3135.1s] the bible says\n[3136.9s] revelation chapter 10 verse 10.\n[3149.0s] shall\n[3154.6s] that message was sweet\n[3156.8s] god was gathering a people\n[3159.2s] to give the message\n[3161.0s] in the last days\n[3162.5s] and now\n[3164.0s] to napoleon de leon\n[3166.2s] that is the history\n[3169.1s] that must repeat\n[3171.2s] illinois says again and again the\n[3173.1s] history of christ withdrawal from judea\n[3175.9s] has been repeated\n[3178.2s] when the reformers\n[3212.8s] we must understand\n[3214.9s] that history\n[3216.3s] very well\n[3217.5s] so that we may be able to stand on the\n[3219.4s] platform of truth\n[3221.2s] on the platform of eternal truth\n[3223.6s] we have established that there was rain\n[3225.8s] in the time of the milarites\n[3228.0s] in the time of the milorites\n[3230.6s] we have established to me\n[3233.2s] the angel the messenger of the covenant\n[3235.5s] was christ himself descended william\n[3238.1s] miller took the position of john the\n[3240.4s] baptist again\n[3242.6s] and now as we progress\n[3244.9s] i want to show\n[3246.6s] that the different denominations did not\n[3249.0s] accept the message\n[3253.6s] of miller\n[3257.8s] the different denominations\n[3269.7s] we are reading tuna summer uh kitab we\n[3272.2s] need to uh\n[3275.3s] uh live sketches\n[3277.4s] this is live sketches of james white and\n[3279.8s] ellen g

course of lectures\n[3300.7s] at the casco street church in portland\n[3303.8s] i felt it a great privilege this is\n[3305.9s] ellen white to attend these lectures\n[3309.1s] because people who are coming out of the\n[3310.9s] various denominations\n[3315.2s] we're going to finish our creeds\n[3317.5s] we're going to talk about water william\n[3329.8s] put these things in mind even as we move\n[3332.2s] with history because the same history is\n[3334.7s] going to repeat again\n[3337.2s] she says\n[3338.8s] for i had fallen under discouragement\n[3341.5s] i did not prepare to meet my savior\n[3344.3s] this second course created much more\n[3347.1s] excitement\n[3348.5s] in the city than the first\n[3350.8s] with few exceptions\n[3353.3s] the different denominations\n[3355.8s] closed the doors of their churches\n[3359.7s] against miller\n[3378.4s] did not do that\n[3379.8s] mila went to seek for another class who\n[3382.6s] would obey the truth and he established\n[3385.2s] places of worship\n[3388.9s] what\n[3394.2s] like in the times of jesus\n[3396.6s] she says in desire of ages 232 paragraph\n[3399.5s] 1\n[3400.8s] that\n[3401.8s] when jesus left the temple the religious\n[3404.1s] leaders a people in whom was given the\n[3407.0s] message\n[3407.9s] he went to another class\n[3411.3s] those who rejoiced in the truth yes\n[3430.7s] self-supporting ministries

denominations\n[3444.4s] made\n[3450.6s] that is a fatal deception\n[3452.7s] even the jewish nation the jewish\n[3454.6s] leaders by the way\n[3456.9s] jesus left the structures\n[3458.9s] jesus left

things we are going to\n[3629.1s] put in record straight as we continue\n[3632.2s] with this presentation it is\n[3648.5s] no that is not true\n[3650.7s] 17 mr 81.4\n[3654.0s] she says\n[3658.6s] god has a church\n[3661.4s] in the last days\n[3662.7s] god has a church\n[3665.7s] it is not the great cathedral\n[3689.6s] neither is it the various denominations\n[3693.3s] canis\n[3703.4s] it is the people who love god and keep\n[3706.7s] his commandments where two or three are\n[3709.7s] gathered together in my name there i am\n[3712.9s] in the midst of them where christ is\n[3715.8s] even among us the humble few\n[3718.0s] this is christ's church\n[3721.3s] for the presence of the high and the\n[3723.0s] lofty one alone\n[3724.6s] that inhabited eternity can alone\n[3727.0s] constitute a chat you can see me\n[3732.7s] quest\n[3737.4s] why do you even have as we move forward\n[3739.4s] to look at the last history in our time\n[3741.3s] period we are going to look carefully\n[3744.2s] because aaron's road is too bad in the\n[3746.6s] time period when jesus is still in the\n[3748.5s] most holy place\n[3754.5s] by the way\n[3755.7s] listen very carefully as we bring this\n[3757.8s] rock to a close\n[3760.1s] revelation chapter 10 and revelation\n[3761.9s] chapter 18 is the same angel\n[3764.9s] by the way revelation chapter 10\n[3767.1s] and revelation chapter 18 is the same\n[3768.9s] angel\n[3770.1s] revelation chapter 10\n[3771.8s] and revelation chapter 18 they are both\n[3773.9s] mighty angels revelation chapter 10 the\n[3776.6s] mighty angel revelation chapter 18 the\n[3778.7s] mighty angel revelation chapter 10 the\n[3786.6s] revelation chapter 18 that mighty angel\n[3788.6s] cries with a loud voice\n[3791.2s] it is the manifestation of christ\n[3792.7s] himself\n[3796.3s] now as we come to our time period\n[3800.4s] look at this something that adventists\n[3803.2s] many adventists have never realized\n[3806.0s] that when the latter end begins in our\n[3807.9s] time period we go back to malachi\n[3809.5s] chapter 3\n[3811.1s] that the messenger of the covenant must\n[3813.8s] prepare people\n[3815.8s] to to\n[3816.9s] for the revelation\n[3818.5s] of jesus to come suddenly\n[3821.8s] to his temple\n[3827.2s] maybe as we introduce revelation chapter\n[3829.0s] 18\n[3832.2s] we have seen that the very first attempt\n[3834.7s] when god attempted to bring revelation\n[3836.5s] chapter 18 the latter in loud cry was in\n[3839.3s] 1888\n[3840.8s] that is the final\n[3842.6s] time their final attempt their final\n[3845.8s] work of god revelation 18 when that work\n[3849.1s] begins\n[3850.7s] two classes of worshippers again\n[3853.6s] there are those who will establish\n[3854.9s] themselves in the in their foundational\n[3856.8s] truths they are those who are going to\n[3858.6s] reject\n[3859.7s] they are those who are going to stick to\n[3861.0s] their denominations they are those who\n[3862.7s] are going to follow christ\n[3864.6s] the voice that will be crying the\n[3866.2s] wilderness there are those who are going\n[3868.0s] to be establishing god's people in the\n[3869.8s] foundational truths\n[3871.8s] there are those who are going to reject\n[3873.2s] their truths two classes of worshipers\n[3876.0s] you must understand where you belong\n[3878.4s] when that work begins officially by the\n[3881.1s] way\n[3883.7s] israel\n[3885.2s] is\n[3886.9s] let us go to jeremiah chapter 3\n[3889.0s] and see how this happened\n[3892.8s] jeremiah number fifteen\n[3895.4s] when aaron's road budded god declared\n[3898.3s] plainly\n[3899.4s] the kind of leaders that he had chosen\n[3901.9s] himself\n[3903.5s] jeremiah chapter three\n[3905.7s] verses number thirteen\n[3908.6s] jeremiah

so\n[3959.2s] and repent and accept that thou has\n[3961.6s] apostasized\n[3976.9s] children that have apostasized\n[3980.1s] this is a plea that god is saying\n[3985.6s] that is the first message that god gives\n[3987.6s] his children those who have apostasized\n[3989.7s] from the truth that is was what israel\n[3992.2s] had done\n[3993.4s] returning return eo backsliding children\n[3997.0s]

never understand\n[4085.2s] when miller began his work and when god\n[4088.1s] began to bring people out of the\n[4090.1s] denomination of churches when people\n[4092.3s] began to preach the first angels message\n[4094.6s] when god began to establish leaders to\n[4097.4s] feed people with the present truth\n[4099.7s] the churches did not know the pharisees\n[4102.2s] did not know and so it will be today\n[4105.1s] the churches will not know including\n[4107.4s] those who have said that they are god's\n[4109.8s] people they will not know\n[4111.5s] wakati muchipuko tanza when god will

        "full_transcript": "yes welcome back we're going to see just just what is entailed in uh the history of the Jews when God called them other people to represent him and his character in the whole world in order to understand the truth as it is in Jesus let us see just what we are supposed to do we are seeing we are reading from the book The salvages and this is based on religion you must take your Bible and confirm if this is true or false go to history and find out for yourself I'm not putting this for you so that I might grind you up and force it into your thought drink it or to swallow it please check into your history and find out if you are supposed to understand the truths for this time I'm going to read from the book called These are of Ages the foundation of Education in Israel we are going to see if education was necessary in Israel was it a true education or was it absent did we have an education system we're going to see let us read from the sort of page number 69 paragraph two you think from the earliest times the faithful the faithful in Israel had given much care to the education of the youth the faithful had given much care in the education of the youth okay the Lord had directed that even from babyhood the children should be taught of his goodness and his greatness all right the CH the from babyhood the children should be taught of his goodness and his greatness especially as revealed in his law the first education was to teach children from babyhood his law God's law okay and shown in the history of Israel okay I think especially as revealed in his his law and shown in the history of Israel how he used to deal with the Israelite he's saying song and prayer and lesson from the scriptures were to be adapted to the opening mind all right song and prayer to in the heat the history of Israelites this is just what happened they used to teach their children through education based on true education they used to teach their children through education God's goodness based in his law then it is going on these are overages page 69 paragraph two chain all right the Lord who had directed that even from baby who the children should be taught of his goodness and his greatness especially as it revealed in his law and shown in the history of Israel song and prayer and lessons from the scriptures were to be adapted to the opening mind fathers and mothers who are to instruct their children that the law of God is an expression of his character all right the law of God was an expression of his character then he's saying and that as they receive the principles of the law into the heart the image of God was stressed on mind and soul that is the essence as to why Jesus came to die on the cross to restore the image of God in man all right both in the mind and in the soul much of the teaching was oral but the youth also learned to read the Hebrew writing they learn how to read and write in short not it is not essential to read Hebrew in order to understand faith in Jesus it is an emphasis of on writing and reading in order to convey a message so we are told but the youth also learned to read the Hebrew writings and the parchment roles of the Old Testament the scriptures were open to their study paragraph three page 69 deservages in the days of Christ the town or city that did not provide for the religious instruction of the young was regarded as Under The Curse Of God yet the teaching had become formal so in a education just as today people required regard those who did not receive education as low right now we can see it just this similarly with we read it it was in Israel so we are reading it's saying yet the teaching had become formal teaching had become so tradition had in a great degree supplanted the scripture tradition had supplanted the scripture okay so tradition what tradition will always approved through education just watch as false education is spreading in the land the True Church of God is going to spread in the land with tradition of men putting on skirts anyway well just going on we are told tradition had in a great degree Supply in the scriptures true education will lead the youth to seek the Lord what seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him acts 17 verse 27 and quote but the Jewish teachers gave the attention to the matters of ceremony the mind was crowded with material all right so we are told that education was in Israel let us see just what happened that education in Israel during the time of Jesus got corrupt got corrupted uh before we read that I'm going to open with a scripture that says John 7 verse number John 7. verse number uh verse 10 it's saying but when his Brethren were gone up then when he was up and to the fists not openly but as it were in secret then verse 11 then the Jesus sought him at the feast and said where is he and verse 12 and he and there was much murmuring among the Jews concerning him for some said he is a good man others saying no but he deceived the people all right so through education versus false education let's see verse number 14 verse 13 John 7 13 how we eat no man speak openly of him for fear of the Jews all right they feared because he had the true education and the Jews had adopted another education we will see if it is true or false we're going to read just from our resources we're saying verse 14. now about the midst of the Feast of in the Middle East of the feast in the Middle East of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught so people are not taught these things so he went up in the middies of the Fists in the middle when it is climax he went to teach the doctrine of true education he went to teach according to True education that God had directed so this let's go and see what he thought how he thought verse 15 and the Jews Marvel saying how no this man let us having never learned I don't know this man let us having never learned so Jesus never went to the school of the Jews so as we read in the set of Ages page 80 that Jesus the rabbits knew Jesus never attended their schools as now we are going to see just how Jesus taught ah this is the services page 70.1 it is saying the Child Jesus did not receive instruction in the synagogue schools never why we are going to find out a lot much much more he's saying his mother was his first human teacher from her lips and from the Scrolls of the prophet he learned of heavenly things the very Words which he himself had spoken to Moses for Israel was for Israel he was now taught at his mother's knee okay so Jesus is receiving the true education home schooling homeschooling all right so he's saying he was now taught at his mother's knee as he Advanced from childhood to youth he did not seek the schools of the rabbis all right as he Advanced from childhoods to youth he did not seek the schools of the rabies he needed not the education to be obtained from such sources okay for God was his instructor all right now those are that is the spirit of true Reformation Spirit of Tourism our schools are teaching religion from the East and some parents are not aware of this we are parents we are not even checking the books our children are learning baptism infant baptism those are pagan Pagan things that are inherited by the Catholicism called Catholic but that is Pagan Pagan my friend they are learning how to communicate with the Dead how to communicate with Spirits they call it Spirits have you have you checked those books we are going to open those books line upon line I'm going to screen them up and to bring them up in the as facilities are going to be brought in God is going to send servants who are going to serve in different capacity machines are going to be here and we're going to expose all that whatever achieving and learning now we are in in the book The salvages page number 70.1 it ends and says I see advance from childhood to youth he did not seek the school of the rabbis he needed not the education to be obtained from such sausage for God was this instruction the question asked during the same the savior's Ministry how now is this man let us having Never Land does not indicate that Jesus was unable to read but merely that he had not received a rabbinical education they never saw Jesus in their schools because in that time as in the previous video that I just gave out was the kingdom of the Greeks the Greeks had colonized the old Earth and the old Earth had been hellenized it has the Earth had received a Greek education with its tradition and and rights but then we are going to see how Israelites had made an alliance with the Fallen Nation Greek and Roman Empire let's go and see we are going to understand events that transpire in the time of Jesus foreshadowed the time of the 144 we are going to see if these things show just our duties it continues how nice this does not indicate that Jesus was unable to read me but merely that he had received he had not received merely he had not received a rabbinical education John 17 7 verse 15. since he gained knowledge as we may do his intimate intimate acquaintance with the scripture shows how diligently his early years were given to the study of God's word okay okay and spread out before him was The Great Library of God's created works all right he who had made all things started the lessons which is on hand had written in art and sky under sky and and sea and sky apart from the Unholy ways of the world he gathered stones of scientific knowledge from nature he studied the life of plants and animals and the life of man from his earliest year he was possessed of one purpose he lived to bless others for this he found resources in nature for this he found resources in nature new ideas of ways and means flushed into his mind as he studied plant as he studied the plant all right um so it is a study plan for this he found resources in nature new ideas of ways and means flashed into his mind as he studied plant life and animal life continually he was seeking to draw from things sin illustration by which he presents the living Oracles of God how to teach the truth of Heaven he had to learn he had to learn as a human he had to see just what human beings are acquainted to in order to teach them the things of heaven then he said continually he was seeking to draw something seen illustration by which he to present the living Oracles of God linking the Heavenly things with the Earthly Jesus had to take time with that in order to know our weaknesses he had to take all that time all three years of ministration to finalize everything he's God my friend but all of us combined we can't finish studying these art actually recently the scientists started discovering some other organism in under the sea that had been existing so it it is not even in reckon they are already putting it in the record so that finding out new on new things yet Jesus took three years to teach the Oracle of heaven so we are told this okay he studied plant life fast forward The Parables by which during his ministry he loved to teach his lessons of Truth show how open his Spirit was to the influences of Nature and how he had gathered the spiritual teaching from the surrounding of his daily life so we see Jesus have obtaining true education in nature right now as you are watching as you have seen just right around us this is nature we are planning and we are already in the ground breaking the ground in order that the this place may be viable for True education and for you you can see we had already begun a modern toilet this is a building of a modern toilet it is under construction and right in front of you on the other side of me you can see we had a structure a simple structure The Lord Is Us directing us to make simple structure for True education we are told as we make two we make ground for True education the Lord will send help let those who have meetings bring their means in order to glorify God to see just what we have to do in this last day and how we should know that these things are taking place are to take place read the signs of the time and knowing the time Romans chapter 13 11 knowing the time that that day is so closer then we should allow arise from let's not sleep for the sleeping virgins to arise they must know the time in which they are living in so we are just uh seeing the education system that Jesus did not receive and the education system which is true that Jesus received as a young alien boy so let me go fast forward to see just what the education the type of education that Jesus received the same same book these are of Ages we are going to sing the book called Desire of Ages page 86 paragraph two the type of education was it a lower education style was it a middle education or was it a higher education and what is high education let's see uh the surveys page number 86 paragraph two it goes saying his brothers are the sons of Joseph were called sided with the rabbis they insisted that the tradition must be heated as if they were the requirements of God they even regarded the precepts of men more highly than the word of God and they were greatly annoyed at the clear penetration of Jesus in distinguishing between the false and the true all right so true education enables you to distinguish true and false his strict obedience to the law of God they condemned as stubbornness that was a reformer my friend that was a reformer they were surprised at the knowledge and wisdom he showed in answering the rubbish they knew that he had not received instruction from the wise men yet they could not but see that he was an instructor to them okay so he was an instructor why because of the education system which he had learned from his babyhood to his manhood through his youthful uh alive he's saying the chain from the wife yet they could not but see that he was an instructor to them to the rabbis they recognized that his education was of a higher time than their own all right they recognized that his education was of a higher type than their own but they did not decide that he had access to the Tree of Life okay so there is something known as the Tree of Life yesterday as we are doing our series we realized that in the Garden of Eden there was a tree fast the tree of knowledge second the tree of life so we have the tree of false and true and we have the tree of pain that perpetuates life so we are seeing that the book The the that in the garden of Heaven had Eden we see that there was a section of instruction Where Angels often Revisited in order to instruct Adam and Eve then we can understand all the prophetic patterns are exact and all striking at the same level just as we are in order to inherit life we have to avoid the mixed education that is mixed true and false and we have to go straight to the Tree of Life which represented Christ Jesus all right so we are seeing but they did not discern that he had access to the Tree of Life a source of knowledge of which they were ignorant okay so Christ was not exclusive and he had given special offense to the Pharisees by departing in his respect from their rigid rules he found the domain of religion fans in by high walls of seclusion as to Sacred a matter for everyday life these words of petition he overthrew true education will overthrow petition okay was of petition or self-service true education will not serve serve true education will serve others the nation will be rid of bribery rib of corruption even your own child will not bribe you therefore you will have fruits of true education the Treaty of life we love we love its bearing upon a nation like this let us see just what true education did in the life of Jesus we want to see just what it was okay uh we are seeing from the book called The sarovated the Simpson book uh seeing the type uh the education system of Jesus what it did to him and others all right was it self-service of others the Jewish that is deserve Ages page 317 paragraph three it is saying this way it is saying the Jews had been instructed from childhood concerning the work of the Messiah all right so true education she will teach you the work of Jesus the work of Salvation the true service the work in which your soul and mind is to be saved like likewise we are seeing the Jews were taught from childhood concerning the work of the Mississauga they inspired utterances so Patrick and Prophets and the symbolic teaching of the sacrificial service had been theirs they were learning in the symbolic teaching in this in the synagogue I mean or in the temple here we are told in the temple they were learning all these sacrificial service so this object lesson about the Messiah but they had disregarded the light and now they saw in Jesus nothing to be desired but the Centurion burning Hedonism Centurion was born in Hidden can you see that Centurion the Centurion we know that the Sanhedrin was full of leaders who were given for self-service now here at the side of which shows us that the Centurion burning Hedonism educated in the idolatry of Imperial Ron all right so they were indicated by the Roman trained as a soldier seemingly cut off from spiritual life by his education and surroundings and still further shot out by the begoty of the Jews and by the content of his own countrymen for the people of Israel this man perceived the truth to which the children of Abraham were blinded so there was a Roman Centurion this Roman Centurion was he learned from a hidden background his background is based on Hedonism therefore what happened he did not wait to see whether he the Jews themselves will receive the one who claimed to be their Messiah so the question is we want to see that the true what true education imparted in the life of Jesus we are seeing that in his life he had to impact the Tree of Life to others through understanding true education like was even unto us we have to impart the light unto the World by understanding just what true education can do to us and our own children if our children received to education that will be true love cry but if they receive no true education they will fail in the courts when they will they shall be summoned before the loyal before the Great Men of the Earth so this Centurion we are told that the Centurion accessed Jesus he did not care whether they use themselves will receive the one who claimed to be their Messer as the light which lighted every man that coming into the world John 1 9. had shown upon him he had though far off the Sun the glory of the Son of God so Jesus reflected the glory of his father okay to the lost the Centurion was a Roman soldier at a capacity of centurion this is a capacity the title of centurion uh sorry I just blinded it as if it was a sun heading but Centurion was the class of I mean it was a category of soldiers who had their duty to be done and they were called Centurion there were those who were called uh other names but now this is a centurion okay okay so we are told that Jesus Jesus a type of education had been that of imparting the blessings of Heaven so what is higher education what does the spiritual prophecy describe as higher education we at all in the book called this Center of Ages page 464 paragraph four it goes on and says that was the True Light which lighted every man that cometh into the world quote the world had the world has had its great teachers men of giant elect and wonderful research men whose utterances have stimulated thought and open to view fast fields of knowledge and this men have been honored as guides and many factors of their race okay like isocrine like soaked like Aristotle glotto this man their words tear star our thoughts into new Fields okay so we are tall in this way but there is one who stands higher than they why don't you go to the one Higher good as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God God no man had seen God at any time they only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he had declared him John 1 12 and verse 18. we can trace the line of the world's great teachers as far back as human record extends okay we can trace back the line okay and see there was great teachers as far back as human records extend but the light was before them so the Highlight was before before them okay and we're told as the moon and the stars of the solar system Shine by The reflected light of the Sun so as far as their teaching is truth do the world's great thinkers reflect the Rays of the son of righteousness okay all of them got their knowledge and wisdom from the one who is higher just like the sun reflects its rays are bounces Rays upon the solar system so we are told that every Gem of thought every flash of the intellect is from the light of the world in these days we hear much about higher education the true higher education is that impacted by him in whom are heed all Treasures of the with of the will of wisdom and knowledge in him was life and the life was the highlight of men Colossians 2 3 and John chapter 1 verse 4. could he that followeth me would say Jesus shall not work in darkness but shall have the light of life and quote the server is 464 paragraph four we are told that true education is to be established in the last days through education medical missionaries centers of influence must be established in the last days in order for you and me to overcome

        "timestamped_transcript": "[1.0s] yes welcome back we're going to see just\n[3.4s] just what is entailed in uh the history\n[6.5s] of the Jews when God called them other\n[8.6s] people to represent him and his\n[10.7s] character in the whole world in order to\n[12.8s] understand the truth as it is in Jesus\n[15.3s] let us see just what we are supposed to\n[18.0s] do we are seeing we are reading from the\n[19.9s] book The salvages and this is based on\n[23.9s] religion you must take your Bible and\n[26.8s] confirm if this is true or false go to\n[29.3s] history and find out for yourself I'm\n[31.8s] not putting this for you so that I might\n[34.0s] grind you up and force it into your\n[36.4s] thought drink it or to swallow it please\n[39.3s] check into your history and find out if\n[42.1s] you are supposed to understand the\n[44.2s] truths for this time I'm going to read\n[45.8s] from the book called These are of Ages\n[48.8s] the foundation of Education in Israel we\n[52.3s] are going to see if education was\n[54.2s] necessary in Israel was it a true\n[56.5s] education or was it absent did we have\n[59.6s] an education system we're going to see\n[61.8s] let us read from the sort of page number\n[64.4s] 69 paragraph two you think from the\n[67.1s] earliest times the faithful the faithful\n[70.0s] in Israel had given much care to the\n[72.6s] education of the youth the faithful had\n[75.6s] given much care in the education of the\n[78.5s] youth okay\n[80.5s] the Lord had directed that even from\n[83.0s] babyhood the children should be taught\n[85.0s] of his goodness and his greatness all\n[88.1s] right the CH the from babyhood the\n[90.7s] children should be taught of his\n[91.8s] goodness and his greatness especially as\n[94.5s] revealed in his law the first education\n[97.4s] was to teach children from babyhood his\n[101.5s] law God's law okay and shown in the\n[104.2s] history of Israel okay\n[107.5s] I think especially as revealed in his\n[110.3s] his law and shown in the history of\n[113.3s] Israel how he used to deal with the\n[115.3s] Israelite he's saying song and prayer\n[117.3s] and lesson from the scriptures were to\n[119.8s] be adapted to the opening mind all right\n[122.3s] song and prayer to in the heat the\n[125.1s] history of Israelites this is just what\n[126.8s] happened they used to teach their\n[128.6s] children through education based on true\n[132.2s] education they used to teach their\n[134.1s] children through education God's\n[136.2s] goodness based in his law then it is\n[138.7s] going on these are overages page 69\n[141.3s] paragraph two chain all right\n[144.5s] the Lord who had directed that even from\n[146.7s] baby who the children should be taught\n[148.3s] of his goodness and his greatness\n[150.1s] especially as it revealed in his law and\n[153.1s] shown in the history of Israel song and\n[155.6s] prayer and lessons from the scriptures\n[157.4s] were to be adapted to the opening mind\n[160.0s] fathers and mothers who are to instruct\n[162.4s] their children that the law of God is an\n[165.5s] expression of his character all right\n[167.6s] the law of God was an expression of his\n[171.1s] character then he's saying and that as\n[173.5s] they receive the principles of the law\n[175.3s] into the heart the image of God was\n[177.7s] stressed on mind and soul\n[180.2s] that is the essence as to why Jesus came\n[183.1s] to die on the cross to restore the image\n[186.2s] of God in man all right\n[190.0s] both in the mind and in the soul much of\n[192.5s] the teaching was oral but the youth also\n[195.4s] learned to read the Hebrew writing they\n[199.1s] learn how to read and write in short not\n[201.5s] it is not essential to read\n[203.6s] Hebrew in order to understand faith in\n[205.6s] Jesus\n[206.5s] it is an emphasis of on writing and\n[210.2s] reading in order to convey a message so\n[212.3s] we are told but the youth also learned\n[215.0s] to read the Hebrew writings and the\n[217.3s] parchment roles of the Old Testament the\n[219.2s] scriptures were open to their study\n[222.4s] paragraph three page 69 deservages in\n[225.4s] the days of Christ the town or city that\n[228.2s] did not provide for the religious\n[229.6s] instruction of the young was regarded as\n[231.8s] Under The Curse Of God yet the teaching\n[234.0s] had become formal so in a education just\n[237.5s] as today people required regard those\n[239.8s] who did not receive education as low\n[242.3s] right now we can see it just this\n[245.3s] similarly with we read it it was in\n[248.3s] Israel so we are reading it's saying yet\n[251.0s] the teaching had become formal teaching\n[253.2s] had become so tradition had in a great\n[256.2s] degree supplanted the scripture\n[258.2s] tradition had supplanted the scripture\n[261.4s] okay so tradition what tradition will\n[265.0s] always approved through education just\n[268.1s] watch as false education is spreading in\n[271.1s] the land the True Church of God is going\n[272.9s] to spread in the land with tradition of\n[275.0s] men putting on skirts anyway well just\n[277.9s] going on\n[279.0s] we are told tradition had in a great\n[281.4s] degree Supply in the scriptures true\n[282.9s] education will lead the youth to seek\n[285.2s] the Lord what seek the Lord if happily\n[287.6s] they might feel after him and find him\n[289.7s] acts 17 verse 27 and quote but the\n[293.0s] Jewish teachers gave the attention to\n[294.9s] the matters of ceremony the mind was\n[297.1s] crowded with material all right so we\n[300.2s] are told that education was in Israel\n[304.4s] let us see just what happened\n[307.9s] that education in Israel during the time\n[311.4s] of Jesus got corrupt got corrupted uh\n[314.8s] before we read that I'm going to open\n[316.5s] with a scripture that says John 7 verse\n[319.0s] number John 7. verse number\n[322.2s] uh verse 10 it's saying but when his\n[326.3s] Brethren were gone up then when he was\n[328.6s] up and to the fists not openly but as it\n[331.4s] were in secret then verse 11 then the\n[333.7s] Jesus sought him at the feast and said\n[335.3s] where is he and verse 12 and he\n[338.9s] and there was much murmuring among the\n[340.9s] Jews concerning him for some said he is\n[343.7s] a good man others saying no but he\n[346.0s] deceived the people all right so through\n[347.9s] education versus false education let's\n[350.6s] see verse number 14 verse 13 John 7 13\n[353.5s] how we eat no man speak openly of him\n[356.8s] for fear of the Jews all right they\n[358.6s] feared because he had the true education\n[360.5s] and the Jews had adopted another\n[363.1s] education we will see if it is true or\n[365.4s] false we're going to read just from our\n[367.1s] resources we're saying verse 14. now\n[369.8s] about the midst of the Feast of in the\n[372.3s] Middle East of the feast in the Middle\n[374.0s] East of the feast Jesus went up into the\n[376.9s] temple and taught\n[378.5s] so people are not taught these things so\n[381.1s] he went up in the middies of the Fists\n[383.5s] in the middle when it is climax he went\n[386.9s] to teach\n[388.0s] the doctrine of true education he went\n[390.9s] to teach according to True education\n[393.3s] that God had directed so this let's go\n[397.1s] and see what he thought how he thought\n[400.0s] verse 15 and the Jews Marvel saying how\n[402.2s] no this man let us having never learned\n[405.4s] I don't know this man let us having\n[407.5s] never learned so Jesus\n[409.4s] never went to the school of the Jews so\n[413.0s] as we read in the set of Ages page 80\n[415.4s] that Jesus the rabbits knew Jesus never\n[418.4s] attended their schools as now we are\n[421.0s] going to see just how Jesus taught\n[425.9s] ah this is the services page 70.1 it is\n[430.0s] saying the Child Jesus did not receive\n[431.5s] instruction in the synagogue schools\n[433.6s] never\n[434.8s] why we are going to find out\n[437.5s] a lot much much more he's saying\n[440.6s] his mother was his first human teacher\n[442.7s] from her lips and from the Scrolls of\n[444.7s] the prophet he learned of heavenly\n[446.8s] things the very Words which he himself\n[448.9s] had spoken to Moses for Israel was for\n[451.7s] Israel he was now taught at his mother's\n[454.7s] knee okay so Jesus is receiving the true\n[457.4s] education home schooling\n[459.5s] homeschooling\n[461.1s] all right so he's saying he was now\n[463.4s] taught at his mother's knee as he\n[465.5s] Advanced from childhood to youth he did\n[467.7s] not seek the schools of the rabbis all\n[470.2s] right as he Advanced from childhoods to\n[472.4s] youth he did not seek the schools of the\n[474.7s] rabies he needed not the education to be\n[476.8s] obtained from such sources okay for God\n[479.8s] was his instructor all right now those\n[483.1s] are that is the spirit of true\n[485.3s] Reformation\n[486.8s] Spirit of Tourism our schools are\n[489.2s] teaching religion from the East\n[492.3s] and some parents are not aware of this\n[494.7s] we are parents we are not even checking\n[496.8s] the books our children are learning\n[498.8s] baptism infant baptism those are pagan\n[502.2s] Pagan things that are inherited by the\n[505.0s] Catholicism called Catholic but that is\n[507.4s] Pagan Pagan my friend they are learning\n[510.8s] how to communicate with the Dead how to\n[513.1s] communicate with Spirits they call it\n[515.5s] Spirits have you have you checked those\n[517.5s] books we are going to open those books\n[520.8s] line upon line I'm going to screen them\n[523.9s] up and to bring them up in the as\n[526.4s] facilities are going to be brought in\n[529.1s] God is going to send servants who are\n[531.9s] going to serve in different capacity\n[534.5s] machines are going to be here and we're\n[537.0s] going to expose all that whatever\n[539.0s] achieving and learning now we are in in\n[541.6s] the book The salvages page number 70.1\n[544.8s] it ends and says I see advance from\n[547.1s] childhood to youth he did not seek the\n[549.2s] school of the rabbis he needed not the\n[551.2s] education to be obtained from such\n[553.5s] sausage for God was this instruction\n[556.4s] the question asked during the same the\n[558.8s] savior's Ministry\n[565.2s] how now is this man let us having Never\n[567.4s] Land does not indicate that Jesus was\n[569.4s] unable to read but merely that he had\n[571.7s] not received a rabbinical education they\n[573.8s] never saw Jesus in their schools because\n[576.2s] in that time as in the previous video\n[578.8s] that I just gave out was the kingdom of\n[582.0s] the Greeks the Greeks had colonized the\n[584.0s] old Earth and the old Earth had been\n[585.6s] hellenized it has the Earth had received\n[588.3s] a Greek education with its tradition and\n[591.2s] and rights but then we are going to see\n[594.6s] how Israelites had made an alliance with\n[598.6s] the Fallen Nation Greek and Roman Empire\n[601.8s] let's go and see we are going to\n[603.9s] understand events that transpire in the\n[606.5s] time of Jesus\n[608.0s] foreshadowed the time of the 144 we are\n[611.8s] going to see if these things\n[614.6s] show just our duties\n[617.5s] it continues how nice this does not\n[620.2s] indicate that Jesus was unable to read\n[621.9s] me but merely that he had received he\n[624.2s] had not received merely he had not\n[626.5s] received a rabbinical education John 17\n[629.1s] 7 verse 15. since he gained knowledge as\n[632.8s] we may do his intimate intimate\n[635.5s] acquaintance with the scripture shows\n[637.7s] how diligently his early years were\n[640.7s] given to the study of God's word okay\n[643.1s] okay and spread out before him was The\n[646.7s] Great Library of God's created works all\n[649.5s] right he who had made all things started\n[652.1s] the lessons which is on hand had written\n[654.4s] in art and sky under sky and and sea and\n[657.3s] sky apart from the Unholy ways of the\n[660.4s] world he gathered stones of scientific\n[662.4s] knowledge from nature he studied the\n[665.3s] life of plants and animals and the life\n[668.0s] of man from his earliest year he was\n[670.9s] possessed of one purpose he lived to\n[674.2s] bless others for this he found resources\n[677.0s] in nature for this he found resources in\n[680.9s] nature new ideas of ways and means\n[683.3s] flushed into his mind as he studied\n[685.9s] plant as he studied the plant all right\n[690.1s] um so it is a study plan for this he\n[692.5s] found resources in nature new ideas of\n[694.2s] ways and means flashed into his mind as\n[696.4s] he studied plant life and animal life\n[698.1s] continually he was seeking to draw from\n[700.9s] things sin illustration by which he\n[704.4s] presents the living Oracles of God how\n[707.0s] to teach the truth of Heaven he had to\n[709.0s] learn he had to learn as a human he had\n[711.5s] to see just what human beings are\n[714.2s] acquainted to in order to teach them the\n[717.7s] things of heaven then he said\n[719.0s] continually he was seeking to draw\n[720.6s] something seen illustration by which he\n[723.2s] to present the living Oracles of God\n[725.2s] linking the Heavenly things with the\n[728.0s] Earthly Jesus had to take time with that\n[730.7s] in order to know our weaknesses he had\n[733.3s] to take all that time\n[736.2s] all three years of ministration\n[739.5s] to finalize everything he's God my\n[743.0s] friend but all of us combined we can't\n[746.5s] finish studying these art actually\n[748.4s] recently the scientists started\n[750.7s] discovering some other organism in under\n[752.9s] the sea that had been existing so it it\n[756.2s] is not even in reckon they are already\n[758.2s] putting it in the record so that finding\n[760.1s] out new on new things yet Jesus took\n[762.7s] three years to teach\n[764.2s] the Oracle of heaven so we are told this\n[768.3s] okay he studied plant life fast forward\n[771.2s] The Parables by which during his\n[773.4s] ministry he loved to teach his lessons\n[775.7s] of Truth show how open his Spirit was to\n[778.5s] the influences of Nature and how he had\n[780.8s] gathered the spiritual teaching from the\n[783.0s] surrounding of his daily life so we see\n[785.5s] Jesus have obtaining true education in\n[789.7s] nature right now as you are watching as\n[792.4s] you have seen just right around us this\n[796.1s] is nature we are planning and we are\n[798.8s] already in the ground breaking the\n[801.0s] ground in order that the this place may\n[803.9s] be viable for True education and for you\n[808.4s] you can see we had already begun a\n[812.0s] modern toilet this is a building of a\n[815.8s] modern toilet it is under construction\n[817.8s] and right in front of you on the other\n[821.5s] side of me you can see we had a\n[824.3s] structure a simple structure The Lord Is\n[827.2s] Us directing us to make simple structure\n[832.1s] for True education we are told as we\n[835.0s] make two we make ground for True\n[837.2s] education the Lord will send help let\n[839.6s] those who have meetings bring their\n[841.9s] means in order to glorify God to see\n[844.3s] just what we have to do in this last day\n[848.2s] and how we should know that these things\n[851.5s] are taking place are to take place read\n[854.9s] the signs of the time and knowing the\n[857.1s] time Romans chapter 13 11 knowing the\n[860.9s] time that that day is so closer\n[864.4s] then we should allow arise from let's\n[868.9s] not sleep for the sleeping virgins to\n[871.7s] arise they must know the time in which\n[873.4s] they are living in so\n[875.6s] we are just uh seeing the education\n[878.6s] system that Jesus did not receive and\n[882.4s] the education system which is true that\n[885.4s] Jesus received as a young alien boy\n[890.1s] so let me go fast forward to see\n[895.0s] just what the education the type of\n[898.3s] education that Jesus received the same\n[900.8s] same book these are of Ages we are going\n[903.5s] to sing the book called Desire of Ages\n[906.4s] page 86 paragraph two\n[910.0s] the type of education was it a lower\n[913.4s] education style was it a middle\n[916.9s] education or was it a higher education\n[919.4s] and what is high education let's see uh\n[923.1s] the surveys page number 86 paragraph two\n[926.5s] it goes saying his brothers are the sons\n[929.4s] of Joseph were called sided with the\n[931.6s] rabbis they insisted that the tradition\n[933.5s] must be heated as if they were the\n[935.9s] requirements of God they even regarded\n[937.9s] the precepts of men more highly than the\n[939.8s] word of God and they were greatly\n[941.6s] annoyed at the clear penetration of\n[943.2s] Jesus in distinguishing between the\n[945.3s] false and the true all right so true\n[947.2s] education enables you to distinguish\n[949.0s] true and false his strict obedience to\n[951.7s] the law of God they condemned as\n[953.6s] stubbornness that was a reformer my\n[955.5s] friend that was a reformer\n[957.5s] they were surprised at the knowledge and\n[959.7s] wisdom he showed in answering the\n[961.5s] rubbish they knew that he had not\n[963.3s] received instruction from the wise men\n[965.2s] yet they could not but see that he was\n[967.9s] an instructor to them okay so he was an\n[970.7s] instructor why because of the education\n[973.4s] system which he had learned from his\n[976.3s] babyhood to his manhood\n[979.4s] through his youthful uh alive he's\n[982.7s] saying\n[985.4s] the chain from the wife yet they could\n[988.4s] not but see that he was an instructor to\n[990.4s] them to the rabbis they recognized that\n[993.1s] his education was of a higher time\n[995.9s] than their own\n[997.9s] all right they recognized that his\n[1001.6s] education was of a higher type than\n[1004.6s] their own but they did not decide that\n[1007.0s] he had access to the Tree of Life okay\n[1010.9s] so there is something known as the Tree\n[1013.7s] of Life yesterday as we are doing our\n[1015.7s] series we realized that in the Garden of\n[1017.9s] Eden there was a tree fast the tree of\n[1020.6s] knowledge second the tree of life so we\n[1023.5s] have the tree of false and true and we\n[1027.0s] have the tree of pain that perpetuates\n[1030.0s] life so we are seeing that the book The\n[1032.6s] the that in the garden of Heaven had\n[1034.9s] Eden we see that there was a section of\n[1038.5s] instruction Where Angels often Revisited\n[1041.2s] in order to instruct Adam and Eve then\n[1043.9s] we can understand all the prophetic\n[1046.5s] patterns are exact and\n[1050.3s] all striking at the same level just as\n[1054.0s] we are in order to inherit life we have\n[1056.6s] to avoid the mixed education that is\n[1060.3s] mixed true and false and we have to go\n[1063.7s] straight to the Tree of Life which\n[1066.0s] represented Christ Jesus all right so we\n[1069.7s] are seeing but they did not discern that\n[1072.3s] he had access to the Tree of Life a\n[1074.2s] source of knowledge of which they were\n[1076.0s] ignorant okay so Christ was not\n[1079.0s] exclusive and he had given special\n[1081.4s] offense to the Pharisees by departing in\n[1084.0s] his respect from their rigid rules he\n[1086.7s] found the domain of religion fans in by\n[1089.3s] high walls of seclusion as to Sacred a\n[1091.6s] matter for everyday life these words of\n[1093.8s] petition he overthrew true education\n[1096.3s] will overthrow petition okay was of\n[1100.9s] petition or self-service true education\n[1104.3s] will not serve serve true education will\n[1106.9s] serve others the nation will be rid of\n[1111.7s] bribery rib of corruption even your own\n[1114.3s] child will not bribe you therefore you\n[1117.1s] will have\n[1118.6s] fruits of true education the Treaty of\n[1121.5s] life we love we love its bearing upon a\n[1124.1s] nation like this\n[1126.2s] let us see just what true education did\n[1129.5s] in the life of Jesus we want to see just\n[1132.3s] what it was okay uh we are seeing from\n[1136.6s] the book called The sarovated the\n[1138.6s] Simpson book\n[1141.1s] uh seeing\n[1143.2s] the type uh the education system of\n[1145.9s] Jesus what it did to him and others all\n[1149.4s] right was it self-service of others\n[1152.1s] the Jewish that is deserve Ages page 317\n[1156.3s] paragraph three it is saying this way it\n[1159.0s] is saying the Jews had been instructed\n[1160.9s] from childhood concerning the work of\n[1162.7s] the Messiah all right so true education\n[1165.1s] she will teach you the work of Jesus the\n[1169.0s] work of Salvation the true service the\n[1172.0s] work in which your soul and mind is to\n[1175.2s] be saved like likewise we are seeing the\n[1177.9s] Jews were taught from childhood\n[1179.3s] concerning the work of the Mississauga\n[1181.2s] they inspired utterances so Patrick and\n[1183.8s] Prophets and the symbolic teaching of\n[1185.5s] the sacrificial service had been theirs\n[1188.0s] they were learning in the symbolic\n[1189.8s] teaching in this in the synagogue I mean\n[1193.0s] or in the temple here we are told in the\n[1195.6s] temple they were learning all these\n[1197.8s] sacrificial service\n[1199.6s] so this object lesson about the Messiah\n[1202.6s] but they had disregarded the light and\n[1206.4s] now they saw in Jesus nothing to be\n[1208.6s] desired but the Centurion burning\n[1211.3s] Hedonism Centurion was born in Hidden\n[1214.3s] can you see that Centurion the Centurion\n[1217.7s] we know that the Sanhedrin was full of\n[1221.1s] leaders who were given for self-service\n[1224.8s] now here at the side of which shows us\n[1227.7s] that the Centurion burning Hedonism\n[1230.7s] educated in the idolatry of Imperial Ron\n[1234.1s] all right so they were indicated by the\n[1236.1s] Roman trained as a soldier seemingly cut\n[1239.2s] off from spiritual life by his education\n[1241.2s] and surroundings and still further shot\n[1243.3s] out by the begoty of the Jews and by the\n[1245.8s] content of his own countrymen for the\n[1248.1s] people of Israel this man\n[1250.2s] perceived the truth to which the\n[1253.2s] children of Abraham were blinded so\n[1255.2s] there was a Roman Centurion this Roman\n[1257.5s] Centurion was\n[1259.2s] he learned from a hidden background his\n[1263.6s] background is based on Hedonism\n[1265.5s] therefore what happened he did not wait\n[1268.4s] to see whether he the Jews themselves\n[1270.7s] will receive the one who claimed to be\n[1272.9s] their Messiah so the question is we want\n[1275.1s] to see that the true what true education\n[1278.0s] imparted in the life of Jesus we are\n[1280.0s] seeing that in his life he had to impact\n[1282.7s] the Tree of Life to others through\n[1285.1s] understanding true education like was\n[1288.2s] even unto us we have to impart the light\n[1290.4s] unto the World by understanding just\n[1293.2s] what true education can do to us and our\n[1296.0s] own children if our children received to\n[1298.0s] education that will be true love cry but\n[1301.1s] if they receive no true education they\n[1303.4s] will fail in the courts when they will\n[1305.8s] they shall be summoned before the loyal\n[1308.2s] before the Great Men of the Earth\n[1311.4s] so this Centurion we are told that the\n[1313.8s] Centurion accessed Jesus he did not care\n[1317.2s] whether they use themselves will receive\n[1319.3s] the one who claimed to be their Messer\n[1321.1s] as the light which lighted every man\n[1323.5s] that coming into the world John 1 9. had\n[1326.9s] shown upon him he had though far off the\n[1329.9s] Sun the glory of the Son of God so Jesus\n[1332.2s] reflected the glory\n[1334.3s] of his father okay to the lost the\n[1337.8s] Centurion was a Roman soldier at a\n[1340.6s] capacity of centurion this is a capacity\n[1343.2s] the title of centurion uh sorry I just\n[1346.9s] blinded it as if it was a sun heading\n[1349.3s] but Centurion was the class of I mean it\n[1354.1s] was a category of soldiers who had their\n[1356.6s] duty to be done and they were called\n[1358.3s] Centurion there were those who were\n[1359.7s] called uh other names but now this is a\n[1362.2s] centurion okay okay so we are told that\n[1364.8s] Jesus\n[1366.4s] Jesus a type of education had been that\n[1370.6s] of imparting the blessings of Heaven\n[1374.7s] so what is higher education what does\n[1377.5s] the spiritual prophecy describe as\n[1379.5s] higher education we at all in the book\n[1381.9s] called this Center of Ages page 464\n[1385.0s] paragraph four it goes on and says that\n[1388.4s] was the True Light which lighted every\n[1390.5s] man that cometh into the world quote the\n[1393.5s] world had the world has had its great\n[1396.0s] teachers men of giant elect and\n[1398.1s] wonderful research men whose utterances\n[1400.2s] have stimulated thought and open to view\n[1402.1s] fast fields of knowledge and this men\n[1404.5s] have been honored as guides and many\n[1406.6s] factors of their race okay\n[1409.3s] like isocrine like soaked like Aristotle\n[1413.6s] glotto\n[1415.2s] this man their words tear star our\n[1418.9s] thoughts\n[1419.8s] into new Fields okay so we are tall in\n[1423.2s] this way but there is one who stands\n[1425.4s] higher than they why don't you go to the\n[1427.5s] one Higher\n[1429.2s] good as many as received him to them\n[1431.5s] gave he power to become the sons of God\n[1433.2s] God no man had seen God at any time they\n[1436.3s] only begotten son which is in the bosom\n[1437.9s] of the father he had declared him John 1\n[1440.6s] 12 and verse 18.\n[1443.8s] we can trace the line of the world's\n[1445.6s] great teachers as far back as human\n[1447.1s] record extends okay we can trace back\n[1451.4s] the line\n[1453.3s] okay\n[1454.8s] and see there was great teachers as far\n[1456.9s] back as human records extend but the\n[1458.4s] light was before them\n[1459.9s] so the Highlight was before before them\n[1462.7s] okay\n[1465.0s] and we're told as the moon and the stars\n[1468.8s] of the solar system Shine by The\n[1470.2s] reflected light of the Sun so as far as\n[1472.7s] their teaching is truth do the world's\n[1474.7s] great thinkers reflect the Rays of the\n[1476.5s] son of righteousness\n[1477.9s] okay all of them got their knowledge and\n[1481.5s] wisdom from the one who is higher just\n[1484.2s] like the sun reflects its rays are\n[1486.9s] bounces Rays upon the solar system so we\n[1489.7s] are told that every Gem of thought every\n[1492.1s] flash of the intellect is from the light\n[1493.7s] of the world in these days we hear much\n[1496.3s] about higher education the true higher\n[1498.8s] education is that impacted by him in\n[1501.1s] whom are heed all Treasures of the with\n[1502.9s] of the will of wisdom and knowledge in\n[1505.3s] him was life and the life was the\n[1507.2s] highlight of men Colossians 2 3 and John\n[1509.8s] chapter 1 verse 4.\n[1511.8s] could he that followeth me would say\n[1514.8s] Jesus shall not work in darkness but\n[1516.6s] shall have the light of life and quote\n[1518.2s] the server is 464 paragraph four we are\n[1521.7s] told that true education is to be\n[1526.1s] established in the last days\n[1529.1s] through education\n[1531.1s] medical missionaries\n[1533.2s] centers of influence must be established\n[1535.7s] in the last days in order\n[1538.3s] for you and me to overcome the Beast and\n[1541.0s] the image please scroll the wall of my\n[1544.8s] that Facebook you will see a study on\n[1547.7s] how to overcome the Beast and how to\n[1549.6s] overcome His Image and how

few of the propess followers of the reformers are actuated by their Spirit few are listening for the voice of God and ready to accept truth in whatsoever guys it may be presented often those who follow in the steps of the reformers are forced to turn away from the churches they love in order to declare the plain teaching of the word of God and many times those who are seeking for light are by
