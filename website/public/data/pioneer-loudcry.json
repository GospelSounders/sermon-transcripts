      "full_transcript": "good afternoon or let's saw Neil at this time a father in Heaven we're grateful for the blessings you have bestowed upon us today We Gather here this afternoon to dig deep into your words to bring clarity to the controversies all around us blessed us for these few moments grant us Heavenly I Salve that we may discern truth that we may also identify error under any guise bless us now we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen I want to turn your attention to Luke Chapter 12. let's turn there Luke chapter 12. how many of you are anxious for tomorrow's service beginning of this final seven days on Earth experience seven Sanctuary feasts are you ready for it friends I'm ready by God's grace now this evening as we spend a few moments addressing these controversies I'm going to ask you kindly to get a writing instrument notepads and the questions that come to your mind as we go throughout this by God's grace at the end I will accommodate those questions I'm going to get my iPad by God's grace and those of you online can also tune in and send in your questions let's turn quickly to Luke chapter 12 and today we're going to continue from where we left off on this morning I was blessed this morning how about you were those points clear as we looked at the sanctuary you see friends everything that we profess to believe as Seventh-day Adventist we believe we can prove those truths from the Bible from the sanctuary am I right yes so what about the logo the actual brand of this church should we be able to prove that also from the sanctuary yes and that's why we are addressing this all-important subject that's not what God plays on his Tabernacle is that what he put dear friends some individuals have taken this logo and actually stated that apparent cross is actually inverted and inverted crosses are connected to witchcraft just follow the top end of that so-called cross when God speaks does he speak plainly and the churches with this and these logos on them if those Tabernacles were in the time of Moses and God inspired a sinner to bring his lamb what Christ have led that sinner to these Tabernacles why wrong address wrong address wrong symbol wrong address they call these three lines Three Angels they call that cherubims that is a disgrace to God there it is friends ecumenical ecumenical straight from Babylon now what if here at safe to serve one day you walked into the church and I had two logos in the front two logos in the center two logos on the walls The Three Angels on one side and the flickering Flame over a so-called book and a cross on the other side what would you think what would you think talk to me what what would come to your mind but I said you do not know what would have come to my mind you don't want to hear it what what would come to your mind if I lost my mind am I insane have I stepped off the platform what else am I confused do you know you have churches out there that claim to believe in present truth claim to be preaching the sermons and the messages for the hour and they have two logos why why would they have two logos The Three Angels on one side or maybe on a website that they oversee but at the actual church building they have that the flickering Flame from Babylon why would they do that what now double-minded want to please everybody that's called compromise one is of god Bible one is of Babylon of Satan that's compromise what would Elijah say if God be God serve him but if bail serve him how long hold you between two opinions not six friends that's called compromise that's called hypocrisy why because if you connect yourself with this organization they want to make sure you have that logo no there's several things I want to say here how many of you remember those days you went to some Churches especially if you are second third fourth generation SDA do you remember uh pardon me not that uh do you remember this logo here or even a rendition of it on the buildings the glass thin windows uh maybe I I took it out that the true logo right there in the center the true logo on the glass stand windows some Churches still had the logo there do you know why they have they have not gotten around to it yet to remodel it but soon they will and others may still have the logo but the message has changed the experience has changed am I right or wrong you know I'm speaking the truth as God lives and as you think about it as they have removed the logo they've also removed the message let's take a look at the first angel what says that first cherubim of chapter 14 of the Revelation verse 7 fear God right say it with me fear God give glory to him why the our office judgment is calm and worship him who made Heaven Earth sea and The Fountains of waters what's number one fear God what does it mean to fear God fear God fear God Victor overseen to despise and hate evil Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 13 the fear of the Lord is to hate evil Pride arrogancy how do we know they have changed the message are they not preaching we will never get victory over sin we'll be sinning until Christ comes what does that mean not only has the logo change but what the message has changed then comes give Glory what does that mean to give Glory Health reform dress reform tempering they are thrown out Health reform just reform Temperance what about judgment they've rejected October 22nd 1844. what about worship God on the seventh day Sabbath have you not heard do you not remember the actual cry that we want to hold Sabbath surfaces on Sunday mornings for those who have to work on Sabbath and cannot come to church on God's Sabbath day Sabbath you can come on Sunday mornings and our church why the logo has changed the merchandise has also changed that's it it would it would be weird as I said bizarre as I said this morning you walk into a Bed Bath and Beyond store and you see no what do they sell inside there so clothing they sell soap okay bath soap right okay and what else Etc you walk inside there and what are they selling watermelon cantaloupe come on now it's it's it's it's it's fall season okay broccoli collards right you would say where am I the sign is correct but the merchandise is incorrect or they don't have the sign and don't have the message Luke chapter 12 go to verse 1. it says be weary after laughing of whom the Pharisees which is what friends hypocrisy hypocrisy and that's why this morning I spent time on this this is God's true sign past that won't spend time on this okay everybody read the red words with me I was told that men will employ every policy to make less prominent the difference between the faith our Seventh-Day Adventists and those who observe the first day of the week past that all right friends okay now notice again they will say we must remove the banner or sign the banner or sign and what sign that God put on his building what sign is on new Jerusalem's Tabernacle the Angels at the gates on the Tabernacle gate and Tabernacle past that won't spend time on that okay I saw some reaching out their hands to remove the banner and to obscure fix that and to obscure its significance I don't want to keep you here too long all right let's move on from this we cannot know and what they want to say friends those who are standing faithful to God in observing the true message and the true logo that they are the ones who have started a new organization now I I wish I had something here on what side of the four corners or four sides of the sanctuary it was the good place on what side East Side so they traveled from where East to where West so what what direction did the Angels cherubims fly east to west from the gate to where the door of the Tabernacle holy Place inner Veil and then most holy is traveling we're east to west and that's why by God's grace we turn our logo with the angels with trumpets not going right to left but what not going left to right but what right to left East to West so when someone sees safe to serve's logo they'll ask a question why are your angels flying right to left what will you say let's go to the sanctuary these cherubims fly how right to left East to West will you say Amen friends we have to make sure we come as close to scripture as possible it's a sign what if someone says come meet me here and remove you remember we were going to evangelize and evangelist John Ryan sent me this uh the direction and instead of putting let's say other member of the address instead of putting uh John's Road he put John's Avenue well here we have John 1 and John's Avenue I'm looking for John's Avenue when it should be John's Road but John is correct but what's incorrect Avenue or road is it important now which direction you're flying or brothers and sisters is it important all right let's move on from that there it is friends you know what let's turn the first Timothy chapter three go there with me and First Timothy chapter three and verse number 16 God's word says uh without controversy great is the mystery of godliness greatest watch Friends the mystery of godliness and there is a controversy going on right now and that controversy is stay in the SDA churches versus come out of apostasy is that clear friends and those who give the latter cry come out of apostasy those in the former group who say you're calling people out of the SDA Church that's what they say that's hypocrisy that's not correct they are creating what we call a straw man because Andrew Enriquez yours truly have never said come out of SDA churches you have ordered me what have I always say come out of what a past State local SDA churches as well as come out of a prostate non-conference churches it goes both ways but when they preach and teach they're calling you to church organization volume 4 page two go to Isaiah chapter one where are you going to my friends Isaiah chapter one what makes our Seventh-day Adventist one more time red words notice how sister white quoted in the blue words the Three Angels messages of course she mentioned first and second that's present truth then she said a red word those who pass through these experiences are to be as firm as a rock to the principles that have made us what everybody Seventh Day Adventist volume what's that volume nine testimonies for the church volume 9 page 48 says let ministers and people bear in mind there may affect that their names are registered on the church's books will not save them oh but I thought if your name is not on a local conference SDA Church you're not going to be saved that was volume nine what page I gave you page 48 pass this won't spend time on that I covered that this morning we cannot now enter into any new Organization for this would mean a pass to see from the word everybody apostasy from the truth now watch this watch Carefree that is the the direction foreign come to me which which slideshow is this it looks weird it looks strange preacher let's see now does this day evening that was from you evangelist Ryan all right let's go to John chapter 15 why do you get that straight preacher preacher that's what I was looking for which direction are the Angels flying we're going to talk afterwards amen preacher come now let's reason and now I use the rod and the staff to comfort you amen they're flying away right to left East to West that's it yeah amen I'm like what's going on here amen all right let's pass this let's let's move past this friend let's go to where we're going now all right east to west amen amen all right watch this now beloved this is uh who is he by the way who is he of where down the show 10 of Three Angels Broadcast Network 3abn several days ago he did a presentation entitled if not now then when how should God's Church deal with homo and what else my friends infanticide and feet decide now notice Danny shoten lay down my he was protesting he was crying aloud he was spearing not no I didn't watch the video all of it I just saw the first portion I want to share with you a clip right here and I want you to tell me what you think about this clip in light off what has transpired with the logo controversy either from the world or should we be using the logo from the Bible no question does anybody know when they voted to change our logo hmm I was in New York City somewhere in 97 98 I'm not sure if my mother recalls that and a letter came to the home from the conference and we saw a small uh five by seven uh pamphlet and in it was described the changing of the logo now who who recalls the date when they voted to change the logo anybody so who changed it who gave them the authority to do so who voted and what reasons did they give to change it what Bible what Spirit of Prophecy and if I'm going to change something you know what they say if it's not broken come on finish it yeah so what's wrong with the Three Angels why do you want to change it who asked those pertinent questions by the way if you're alive and you had the answers just send in that comment there email me let's talk about it friends back to this preacher here Mr protester hear what he said in light of the logo listen so today for those who think I'm paranoid now I'm gonna get into some really heavy stuff right now for those of you who think I'm paranoid or just homophobic let me first give you a few real life examples of deceptions affecting the leadership even in this church I love this church I love this church I never intend to to leave this church right that's not my intentions if if if they start teaching things as a church as a body if we start teaching things it's not biblical I'm going to leave I'm leaving because my loyalty is to God where's your loyalty he's leaving where's he going look at what is situated on the bottom right of the screen what is that a logo what is that how many of you recall the first three ABN logo was that it come on what's that it was that it what is that imagine God saying sinner come to this Tabernacle with cherubims and he walks up and you see three lines where is the sign so he may need to pack his bags right but where is he going and the Very sins he's protesting against in Loma Linda elsewhere have been supported by leadership in the general conference why do I say that the mere fact that there are moaned and silent on the point it means that they're complicit with the same apostasis am I clear all the points playing let's pray for The Elder here let's move on my friends watch this this is a controversial statement that has been floating around seventh day adventism and normally in Sabbath afternoons this time around after evangelism we will go into question and answer question and answer so this question was posed was posed this statement is found on the white eg1 estate of egy writings all right friends now this red box two small paragraphs I'm gonna magnify those two paragraphs okay it was written in 1901 September 24th okay and many use this statement to say it doesn't matter what's happening in the church stay in the churches now watch there's no qualification given so if there's apostasy in that local church stay right there say right there supported supported we I don't teach that wherever apostasy is among leadership after you pray with after you consult with if they continue to promote and teach them the heresy you should not stay there based on the Bible and the spirit of Prophecy you should not find somewhere else and go you should not because by beholding you become one changed and once you stay there and support it you strengthen the apostates I'm not speaking about the pews leadership I'm talking about all right so we are going to be addressing this statement here watch carefully so friends here it is let not the professed people of God think it's a privilege to separate from conference organization that they may show their supposed efficiency and I think our sisters here who also asked this question several weeks ago red words this is entirely opposed to God's word this is what friends no no please talk back to me so I'm so I'm clear that you're following the bouncing ball this is entirely opposed to God's order what is entirely opposed to God's order to separate from what conference organization let's read on there is need of perfect unity and love and this will appear when we learn of Jesus it is the plan of God that every church and every conference shall cherish the feeling of reciprocal dependence what friends depending on each other or I depend on you you depend on me reciprocal okay let me ask you a question if I say to you that this statement in 1901 shouldn't you get every other statement in sister-watch writings about Ministries comma churches comma publishing houses comma medical missionary institutions comma not being under schools comma not being under the conference would you say Amen to that that one statement Must Destroy every other who with intelligence would reason like that you take one statement that says it's not in God's order to separate from the conference organization use that to destroy every other statement that says the opposite and say look when you read those are the statements they must be understood based on this one how could that be that's the same argument the Sunday people use to justify Sunday what year is that written in 1901 right September look at the statement here what year is this at the bottom 1907 to whom their sister went right Elder Daniels was actually the general conference president watch this statement when my advice was asked in reference to the Madison School the watch School now when you hear school you're thinking uh classroom setting theater style uh a lectern and teacher the Madison School means an Enterprise right setting up training centers and raising up schools churches medical missionary sites and Publishing houses watch this by the way let's go there because I put it in your mind listen located 10 miles Northeast of Nashville Madison was an important spot in early Southern Seventh-Day adventism the Madison property often referred to as a medicine farm so you have management School management Farm was purchased in what year 1904 with the financial assistance of Nelly uh Gillard and the prophetic vision of Ellen White it says spearheaded by EA Sutherland Percy Megan the medicine contingent contingent now would spawn a collection of what schools hospitals Industries and what churches around the South so what were they establishing all right watch careful now let's go right here I'll come back to that watch us now friends it says when my advice was asked in reference to the Madison School I said remain as you are there is danger in binding every working agency everyone Elder Buchanan I mean should I go there now you say no are you my conscience preacher listen I agree with you there is a danger in binding every working agency under the what friends the dictation of the conference the Lord did not design that this should be so friends which statement was inspired the 1901 or 1907 which one which one was inspired which one both were inspired so why the difference circumstances what's the difference circumstances now here is a counter argument to this statement here on the screen some would say well that's true that's how medicine began not with the conference but later on in years right later on maybe a decade after or so some of the various institutions they established came back under the conference so that means you must negate this instruction here who is in that way because circumstances changed does not destroy the council that was given have ever read in the Bible the Lord repented have you why would God repent that would be a good Bible question so let me not give too much on that okay but why did God repent because circumstances changed so he promised destruction right and what happened it was coming but they were they repented so God withheld it God repented oh that's the answer right dear friends can God sin so repent it doesn't mean to sin and repent and to convert amen so God changed because circumstances change he withheld destruction one example Nineveh minivan amen it's clear God withheld destruction let's continue it says the Lord did not design that this should be what are the next two words in blue the circumstances were such the burden-bearers in the Madison School could not bind up their work with the conference I knew their situation and when many of the leading men in our conferences ignore them because they did not Place their school under the the conference dictation I was shown that they would not be helped by making themselves amenable to what the conference they had better remain as led by God amenable to him to work out his plans but this matter need not be blazed abroad so friends what if the circumstances that were Rife and prevalent in this time 1907 when the instruction was given what if they are prevalent today would it be okay then to follow the same instructions or do you not believe in inspiration is inspiration it was given because of circle says are they alive in the world today so how could you negate the statement and because they can they say well later on some of those churches were brought under the conference does that negate the instruction sometimes men reason as if they are infants and it's either they are ignorant listen attentively either they are ignorant or they lack comprehension skills they lack intelligence or they have a Sinister agenda I wonder what it is which one let's move on Modern paragraph it says means have been held from them Madison because in the organization and management of the Madison School it was not placed under the control of the conference but the reason why this school wasn't owned and controlled by the conference have not been duly considered move on then she said watch carefully friends how much of this I want to give you watch carefully you want all of it some with all of it red words Huntsville first sentence Alabama Madison listen in the matter of the Madison School there has been a standing off from them because they were not under the ownership and control of some conference all right it says this is a question thou should sometimes be considered but it is not the Lord's plan that means should be withheld from medicine because they were what I want to ask you a question what antithesis do we hear to that statement every tithe every offering must go weird huh so you hear one thing but read something else Luke 12 verse 1 Beware of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees the leaven of the leaders hypocrisy that's what it says right there that means means can go to where institutions not connected to the conference let's read on the attitude with some of our Brethren have assumed toward this Enterprise shows it is not wise for every every working agency to be under the dictation of conference officers there are Harmony they're all is that what sister white wrote they're all no there are some Enterprises on the one certain conditions that will produce better results if one standing alone that's abc123 is that clear friends now that's why you you would never hear yours truly say every church is in apostasy or everybody come what I'm simply calling people out of War apostasy wherever it is conference lines or self-supporting lines now do we have to wait second do we have to wait to see apostasy and use that as the reason to stand alone no no no you don't have to give me a Biblical example of that where somebody didn't work with the conference the sanhegan council but yet stood alone in Ministry John the Baptist who was he by the way before I get to Christ who was he by the way John the Baptist whose son was he Zacharias who was Zacharias high priest so in the natural order of things what and who what office should John the Baptist have assumed high priest priesthood but what happened God didn't call him to become a high priest a pastor an elder in the Sanhedrin Conference of synagogues he had a self-supporting and independent Ministry of the conference song Enterprises can stand alone I'm going to say this many of these men they frame their talking points as if there's only one side that has an issue as if you folks over here who are self-supporting you despise the brethren in the conference and separate yourself you will never hear them look on the other angle and say those men in the conference don't want to hear truth hypocrisy and they in the conference will never invite some men to come and preach in their pulpits it's always one perspective Sinister agenda when you can be balanced you can be bought and sold you're a Slave let's move on from that I told you you're going to get it what year is this at the bottom what year what year do you remember hold on because everything I say I must give you receipts receipts you remember a man whose name is he's alive Bill not and he wrote an article says time to marginalize he says it's time to ostracize men like dog Bachelor anyone who preaches against women's ordination should not be brought into SDA pulpits what is that separation right let's come here what year is this on the screen friends 1903 okay notice now this is Ellen White and she's speaking of her son Edson white that's the first two sentences blue words just a white rights he it's in white her son will be accounted out of what out of line but many ought to be out of the lines that have been maintained to be the regular routine how many no some few many and unless they themselves the conference line come into line they will say we are God's Church so the conference Brethren will say we are God's Temple we are God's Church sister white says unless that Temple is purified cleansed and Sanctified God would not give them his presence in the temple of which they boast those who would have rejoiced to see something done were all determined to give one no recognition to whom it's in white as a person or the one his work why because he did not work in the break what is a regular lines the conference what year is that but they caught 1901. now which one which one came after 1901 oh friends listen God has presented before you how he regarded the regular lines it says it needs to be broken as a word a partridge vessel is broken and what reconstructed how could you say 1901 Must Destroy this statement put this reference down in great controversy 371 sister white rights she says not one statement should be used not once saying of Christ let's fix it properly not one thing of Christ should be used to destroy another you can't do that friends they're all inspired let's let's move on now look at this statement here what year is that at the bottom 1907 where was Sister white in 1907 or even before 1907 where was she because I mean that was when it was written where was she what was she doing she said the churches that her son established outside of the conference she was there to dedicate those churches 1907. now here is a counter argument yeah but some of those churches decades after were brought back into the conference does that negate the statement ignorance a lack of mental Acumen Lord have mercy let's move on from that and there it is stay as you are you don't need to unite with them all right what year is this first line blue words 1901 who is Sister what writing to who was A.G Daniels General Conference president and what does she write she says pharisaism red words Ferry says him in the Christian world is what not extinct she says in the SDA church we have a Pharisees him so she's connecting the Sanhedrin council with the General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists what year is that in 1901 what does she say the regular lines may prove a failure and a want a sneer conference lines for instance 1901. 1901 again she says shall the regular lines which say every mind shall be what what's the word controlled not every working agency church should be under the control of the conference 1903 1907 1901 how many more statements you want every mind shall be controlled by two or three Minds at Battle Creek continue to Bear Swift well oh pastor we have 13 divisions now we have more than two or three it's not the amount of men is what you're teaching and what they're supporting and promoting that's the problem because if you have how many how many men ruled Israel in the time of King Saul was it not Samuel was he faithful to God let's move on shall men go to the regular lines to see whether they will be permitted to labor or shall they go out and work as best they can depending on their own work we don't need their ordination nor their approval go to work for God all right friend how much more let me see something here all right 1901 James Edson white she says the Lord has blessed my son in the south second sentence God grant that the voices which have been so quickly raised to say that all the money invested in the work must go through the appointed Channel at Battle Creek shall what not be heard Battle Creek today is what now there in Spring Michigan or the one in in Maryland DC Silver Spring Maryland it is their privilege to give what direct Aid and what assistance to missions that's it friends it's clear there it is again Edson white past that friends write this down that reference please very very important it says it is as hard today to break away from what what did you all hear that everybody read words what it says it is as hard today to break away from the regular lines as it was in whose day in Christ's day what does Breakaway mean huh what does Breakaway mean listen we have had great light let us not become narrow let us break the bonds which bind us hard to break away from what the regular lines now is Sister white saying Everybody Must Break Free at the conference but where their circumstances you can stand how separate alone with Christ with Christ with Christ okay go to John 15. do you know what is startling among these men they give you several quotes and hardly no Bible no Bible and that's why their statements and arguments are convoluted as we would say Tom foodery where are we going to John what chapter go to John 15. what does verse 1 say in John 15 friends what does Christ saying I am the what the true vine listen to what sister white says Bible Spirit of Prophecy this is the Desire of Ages she writes I am the True Vine listen the Jews had always regarded the vine as the most noble of plants and a type of all that was powerful excellent and fruitful Israel had been what represented as a what Vine which God had planted red words the Jews based the hope of Salvation on the fact of what friends their connection with Israel can Church connection save anybody what saves What Not Who what saves truth who saves who is he the way the truth the life listen what Christ now says I am the real Vine think not that through a connection with the church you may become partakers of the life of God and inheritors of his promise so me alone a spiritual life received that Bible and spirit of Prophecy how then could you believe that sister white is going to write anything different John 15 let's move on sister white rights the Pharisees declared themselves the children of Abraham Christ told them that this claim could be established only by doing what the works of Abraham blue words a mere lineal descent from Abraham was of no value without a spiritual connection with Christ your connection means nothing and that's what they're preaching stay in the church they're preaching salvation through the church and people are eating and drinking that Hook Line and Sinker deceive they haven't read nor prayed over this for themselves one more statement all the Desire of Ages all right it says descent do I want this one you could take note of the reference I'll move on from this one okay argue for this one page 107 paragraph one John the Baptist said the ax is laid weird at the root red words not by its name but by its fruit is the value of a tree determined if the fruit is worthless the name cannot save the tree from oh would the name save you was Seventh-Day Adventists save you I cannot save you what must we have what must we reveal what must we manifest the fruit last sentence profession was profession is worthless if our lives and characters are not in harmony with God's law we are not his people and Christ made this statement John 15 before he was crucified and Christ's crucifixion typifies the sunderl it's relevant right now and applicable let me see how much more of this I can give you than I'll close go to Matthew 15. where are we going to friends Matthew 15. let's take this Matthew 15 look at verse 7. what did Christ preacher give me 10. what did Christ preach in verse 7 and call the leaders Hypocrites right Hypocrites skip one down with me to verse number nine what were they teaching men's doctrines all right for God's Commandments and they were worshiping God in vain skip on down to verse number verse number 12. the disciples came to Christ Lord you offended the leaders of the church Christ the Christ apologize he said nothing wrong he spoke present truth no need for apology look at verse number 14. what did Christ say now verse 13 every plan my father had not planted shall be won rooted up let them alone what look at the statement the disciples had been much disappointed that Jesus had not tried to secure what everybody the cooperation of the leaders in Israel they felt it was a mistake for Jesus not to strengthen his cause by securing the support of these influential men past Enriquez why do you not work with the conference leaders ask them the same question and reverse it and see what they tell you that's them watch it says the corporation of such men listen as the disciples were anxious to secure would have betrayed the work of God into the hands of its home birth enemies is that clear friends some people will see this and still say I don't see it do you know why they're blind they're blind they're blind they're blind let's go to Lou chapter nine Bible Spirit of Prophecy where we're going to France Luke Chapter now look what this says in Luke chapter 9. let them alone by the way by the way hold your place in Luke 9 go to Acts 2 leave them alone acts what chapter now Acts chapter 2. this is on the day of Pentecost right probation had not yet been closed on the Jewish Church look at Acts chapter 2 verse 40. the disciples said to the people save yourselves from this world unto Ward Generations what's untoward mean corrupt meaning leave them alone verse 41 they were baptized verse 42 the people after being baptized did they go back to those apostate leaders yes or no did they my friends no they fellowshipped with whom those who had truth those of Our Truth Bible do you remember in John chapter 6 when the majority of Christ disciples left him and Christ turned to the twelve and said to them will you also go what did Peter say to whom shall we go you have what the words of eternal life so what were they following truth truth truth but those men went right back to the conference of that day before I take Luke 9 have you ever heard people say to rebut this sister white died in the church I wonder which church you got in sister white preach in the Adventist churches SDA churches she had credentials in the SDA churches so that must be used to negate her statements do you see the fallacy in the reasoning so because she died a Seventh-Day Adventist that must you be used to negate that she says on the several circumstances it's okay for churches Enterprises to stand separate from the conference control who would reason that way want to ask a question did Christ preach in the synagogues did he yes he did did sister white preach in the SDA churches yes she did did Jesus also simultaneously set up a Ministry Church training school baptizing people not with the Sanhedrin yeah did sister white simultaneously support Ministries churches schools not with the conference yeah so where's the problem it's in your minds that's where it is you have a Sinister agenda it's clear for those who want to see it is the Bible true go to Luke 9. Luke 9 you have to use Bible and spread of Prophecy and some people still won't believe this I am simply making sure it's on the record let me hear some my footsteps Luke chapter 9 in verse 49 and John answered Master we saw one doing what casting out devils in thy name what happened we forbade him why because he did not follow us he was not with our ministry do you realize that these were disciples not with the conference and yet they were telling Christ please support seek the approval of the Sanhedrin many of you who are sitting here might have the same sentiment Pastor henriquez I come to save to serve but please work with the conference please the same thing with Christ 12 disciples nothing new Under the Sun nothing new here they are now in Luke 9. they are saying Master this man is not under our ministry and control so he should not be preaching let's do everything on social media to shut him down let's misconstrue statements publish them to deceive the people to stop listening and following him same situation here go to verse 15. what did Christ say now you have done well no forbid him not why listen what sister white says here friend she says watch carefully come on where is it all right she says Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and that man didn't follow us listen now James and John had taught James and John had thought that in checking this man they had had in view their Lord's honor and listen to me these preachers on social media in the SDA Church they called themselves champions of the faith we are champions for the conference do you know who they are they are modern day Dr EK again who was Dr EK against have you read the book great controversy who was Dr Eck again Martin Luther the Protestant reformer they are the modern day Dr Eric okay listen James and John had thought that in checking this man they had had in viewed their Lord's honor they began to see that their reward they were what so what was at the root of all those polls and videos jealousy jealousy but afterwards they acknowledge their error and accepted Christ's reproof listen none who showed themselves in any way friendly to Christ if they are preaching present truth leave them alone listen now when Jesus was no longer personally among them and the work was left in their hands they must not indulge award narrow exclusive spirit but manifest the same Farm reaching sympathy which they had seen in whom in their master I digress on that point beloved do you realize question for you which of these two men began their Ministry first Jesus or John the Baptist who John the Baptist was John's Ministry with the conference of that day no what about Christ no all right when Christ came on the scene did he say John you have to close up shop you gotta you got to stop Ministry and join me that happen what happened both were working even John disciples didn't say we would stop preaching and John cries no they had separate Ministries that's Bible brothers and sisters Bible Bible this idea of everyone coming under one head is potpourri that's what it is let's close let's close let's close let's close go to numbers 11. where are we going to numbers 11. so New Testament go to Old Testament now now I won't read this but put the reference down numbers 11 verse 25 pardon me verse 24 numbers 11 verse 25 through verse 29. God gave his spirit upon 70 elders to help Moses in the work and out of 70 68 went one way and two did not follow the 68. do you know what Joshua did yeah the same Joshua he ran to Moses Moses you need to check these two men they won't follow us and what did Moses say Joshua do you know what's in your heart for those two men Envy Envy Old Testament jealousy New Testament look at verse 29 with me where are we going to it says and Moses now said unto Joshua enviest thou for my sake what God not all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them let's close now I keep saying that here it is Friends it says that watch carefully these men will never give the right mode to other minds they have not grown up to the first stature of men and women in Christ they simply live the name of Christian but they are not fitted for the work of God and never will be until they are born again and learned their ABCs in the religion of Christ Jesus red words there is hope in One Direction take the young man and woman and place them where they will come as little as possible in contact with who no no Babylon no Babylon our churches so was Sister white calling for a separation from the conference here's my last Point hold on I'm going to step on a tour right now did you wear your steel toe boots listen volume eight page 310 Our Savior did not encourage any to attend the rabbinical schools of his day no I won't drop the mic I'm going to hold the mic you see the world drops mics we don't drop Mike amen we hold the mics amen the world drop mics we don't drop mics we give the trumpet a certain sound this thing sound what would the rabbinical schools of his day be today name them Andrews Southern Loma Linda awkward name them puc La Sierra name them Walla Walla name them uh the one in Jamaica there ncu same thing the rabbinical school's office day that's it friends he wouldn't he would not so would that be classified as calling people out of church and when they go to when they go to our schools do they leave without debt or in debt the majority that's not God's will not God's will okay let me close right here beloved I've heard people say only conference churches are going to finish the work only people in the conference listen watch only people in the conference are going to finish the work who believes that raise a hand not one hand come on who believes that only people in the SD a conference will finish the work anything that will transpire in the last days we should find it in the Bible First Advent or before that at the first Advent which men first receive the early reign oh so I'm speaking to myself so Andrew which man first received the early Reign at the first Advent Pentecost the Sanhedrin people or the ones with Christ which one which the latter group the 120 to 120. worthy in the upper room where were the others in the dark and synagogues 120. 120. they received the Holy Spirit first I wonder why what were they following truth what were the other folks following man-made tradition do you see his friends hold on but were there some good folks over there you remember Nicodemus Pastor you said you were closing huh you said you were a closing pastor neither Joseph nor Nicodemus had openly accepted Christ while he was living they knew that such a step would exclude them from the conference Sanhedrin and they hope to protect Christ by the influence in its councils what does that mean we can stay in the conference and still preach president truth for a Time they had seemed to succeed listen but the Wily priests seeing their favor to Christ had thwarted their plans in their absence Christ had been what condemned delivered to be crucified now that Christ was dead they no longer Nicodemus no longer what concealed their attachment to him here's my point there's some pastors right now in the SDA conference who are timid and a fruit to stand for all the truth they will stand later on a few a few will stand later on we are biblical example for that I feel that's why you would never hear me say all our in apostasy there are few who will have to come out when Nicodemus and Joseph came out they had to separate themselves from what the apostate leadership they had to the leadership they had to some will come out but those who think now we can stay right here a day is going to come you'll have to make a decision make what a decision that's New Testament what about Obadiah in the time of whom Elijah Obadiah go tell Ahab Elijah is here what if I go and preach the Elijah's message to Ahab Ahab will chop off my head and that's why many conference pastors like Obadiah will not preach the Elijah's message calling even their own superiors to repentance they won't do it why paycheck why retirement why uh what else accolades why they don't want to be diffract why ordination why all of it afraid they're selling out cries for 30 pieces of silver 120 I'm closing now 120 received the Holy Spirit first and then they went out and began to preach the majority of the Jews had the last opportunity the majority rejected some came in accept the truth among those who came in the Bible says there were priests who came in they were priests let's be faithful to the Bible we don't have to skew the Bible to suit our sinful agenda preach the word some of them will come out of error and stand on the platform of Truth okay what have we learned today were things clearer were things made plain where things may play So if you think only force in the conference will finish this work you are ignorant of the Bible The Men Who first received the early Reign were men not with the conference how will it be in the last days who first will get the lettering oh pastor guys I can't see that only those who are living and following present truth wherever they are they will be the ones and if they're faithful they're not going to be supported by those men and we pray for them do you think Christ prayed for Caiaphas of course he did of course but was he praying for himself no he was not and that's where I close we have to pray for ourselves study for What study for ourselves we cannot just say

today\n[21.2s] We Gather here\n[23.3s] this afternoon to dig deep into your\n[25.7s] words\n[27.3s] to bring clarity\n[29.7s] to the controversies all around us\n[32.9s] blessed us for these few moments\n[35.3s] grant us Heavenly I Salve that we may\n[39.1s] discern truth\n[41.8s] that we may also identify error\n[45.7s] under any guise\n[47.5s] bless us now we pray\n[49.4s] in the name of Jesus Christ amen\n[54.1s] I want to turn your attention to Luke\n[56.0s] Chapter 12. let's turn there Luke\n[59.0s] chapter 12.\n[61.9s] how many of you are\n[64.8s] anxious for tomorrow's\n[67.8s] service\n[70.1s] beginning of this\n[72.6s] final seven days on Earth\n[76.1s] experience\n[78.1s] seven Sanctuary feasts are you ready for\n[81.3s] it friends\n[83.2s] I'm ready by God's grace now this\n[87.0s] evening as we spend a few moments\n[88.9s] addressing these controversies I'm going\n[92.6s] to ask you kindly to get a writing\n[94.3s] instrument notepads and the questions\n[97.5s] that come to your mind as we go\n[99.9s] throughout this by God's grace at the\n[103.2s] end I will accommodate those questions\n[106.8s] I'm going to get my\n[109.7s] iPad by God's grace and those of you\n[112.4s] online can also tune in and send in your\n[117.2s] questions let's turn quickly to Luke\n[119.8s] chapter 12 and today we're going to\n[122.8s] continue from where we left off on this\n[126.3s] morning I was blessed this morning how\n[128.5s] about you\n[130.0s] were those points clear\n[131.9s] as we looked at the sanctuary\n[134.5s] you see friends everything that we\n[136.6s] profess to believe as Seventh-day\n[139.8s] Adventist we believe we can prove those\n[144.1s] truths from the Bible from the sanctuary\n[147.1s] am I right\n[148.3s] yes so what about the logo\n[151.3s] the actual brand of this church should\n[154.9s] we be able to prove that also from the\n[157.8s] sanctuary\n[158.8s] yes and that's why we are addressing\n[162.2s] this all-important subject that's not\n[165.6s] what God plays on his Tabernacle\n[169.4s] is that what he put dear friends\n[171.6s] some individuals have taken this logo\n[174.8s] and actually stated that apparent cross\n[179.4s] is actually inverted\n[183.7s] and inverted crosses are connected to\n[187.5s] witchcraft\n[189.7s] just follow the top end of that\n[193.0s] so-called cross\n[195.8s] when God speaks does he speak plainly\n[199.9s] and the churches with this and these\n[202.6s] logos on them if those Tabernacles were\n[206.8s] in the time of Moses and God inspired a\n[210.4s] sinner to bring his lamb what Christ\n[213.2s] have led that sinner to these\n[215.6s] Tabernacles\n[217.1s] why\n[218.9s] wrong address wrong address\n[222.8s] wrong symbol wrong address\n[226.7s] they call these three lines Three Angels\n[230.3s] they call that cherubims\n[232.4s] that is\n[234.2s] a disgrace to God there it is friends\n[237.7s] ecumenical\n[239.3s] ecumenical\n[241.3s] straight from Babylon now what if here\n[244.5s] at safe to serve one day you walked into\n[247.4s] the church and I had two logos in the\n[250.6s] front two logos in the center two logos\n[254.1s] on the walls\n[255.5s] The Three Angels on one side and the\n[258.7s] flickering Flame\n[260.6s] over a so-called book and a cross on the\n[263.6s] other side what would you think\n[267.2s] what would you think talk to me what\n[268.8s] what would come to your mind\n[270.5s] but I said you do not know what would\n[272.6s] have come to my mind you don't want to\n[274.1s] hear it what what would come to your\n[275.9s] mind\n[278.4s] if I lost my mind\n[281.0s] am I insane\n[283.4s] have I stepped off the platform what\n[285.8s] else\n[287.4s] am I confused\n[289.4s] do you know you have churches out there\n[292.3s] that claim to believe in present truth\n[296.3s] claim to be preaching the sermons and\n[300.2s] the messages for the hour and they have\n[303.1s] two logos why\n[306.0s] why would they have two logos The Three\n[308.9s] Angels on one side or maybe on a website\n[312.5s] that they oversee but at the actual\n[315.2s] church building they have that the\n[317.5s] flickering Flame\n[319.5s] from Babylon why would they do that\n[322.4s] what now\n[324.4s] double-minded want to please everybody\n[326.4s] that's called compromise\n[330.4s] one is of god Bible one is of Babylon of\n[334.2s] Satan that's compromise what would\n[336.6s] Elijah say\n[338.2s] if God be God\n[340.0s] serve him but if bail\n[342.6s] serve him how long hold you between\n[347.8s] two opinions not six friends that's\n[350.4s] called compromise that's called\n[352.3s] hypocrisy why because if you connect\n[355.9s] yourself with this organization they\n[358.7s] want to make sure you have that logo\n[361.9s] no there's several things I want to say\n[363.8s] here how many of you remember those days\n[366.0s] you went to some Churches especially if\n[368.6s] you are second third fourth generation\n[372.2s] SDA do you remember uh pardon me not\n[375.2s] that\n[376.7s] uh do you remember this logo here\n[379.9s] or even a rendition of it\n[382.6s] on the buildings\n[384.4s] the glass thin windows\n[386.7s] uh maybe I I took it out that the true\n[390.8s] logo\n[392.0s] right there in the center the true logo\n[394.1s] on the glass stand windows\n[397.3s] some Churches still had the logo there\n[400.1s] do you know why they have they have not\n[402.7s] gotten around to it yet\n[405.2s] to remodel it\n[407.0s] but soon they will\n[408.8s] and others may still have the logo but\n[411.9s] the message has changed\n[415.4s] the experience has changed\n[419.0s] am I right or wrong\n[420.6s] you know I'm speaking the truth as God\n[422.7s] lives and as you think about it as they\n[425.9s] have removed the logo\n[427.7s] they've also removed the message let's\n[430.6s] take a look at the first angel\n[432.7s] what says that first cherubim of chapter\n[435.8s] 14 of the Revelation verse 7 fear God\n[439.3s] right say it with me fear God give glory\n[443.0s] to him why the our office judgment is\n[446.4s] calm and worship him who made Heaven\n[449.7s] Earth sea and The Fountains of waters\n[452.2s] what's number one\n[453.8s] fear God what does it mean to fear God\n[457.0s] fear God fear God\n[459.2s] Victor overseen to despise and hate evil\n[463.6s] Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 13 the fear\n[467.0s] of the Lord is to hate evil Pride\n[470.7s] arrogancy how do we know they have\n[473.4s] changed the message are they not\n[475.7s] preaching we will never get victory over\n[478.2s] sin we'll be sinning until Christ comes\n[481.3s] what does that mean\n[483.0s] not only has the logo change but what\n[485.9s] the message has changed\n[488.9s] then comes give Glory what does that\n[491.4s] mean to give Glory\n[493.5s] Health reform dress reform tempering\n[496.4s] they are thrown out Health reform just\n[499.4s] reform Temperance what about judgment\n[502.6s] they've rejected October 22nd 1844.\n[506.6s] what about worship God on the seventh\n[509.0s] day Sabbath have you not heard do you\n[512.2s] not remember the actual cry that we want\n[516.0s] to hold Sabbath surfaces on Sunday\n[519.3s] mornings for those who have to work on\n[521.9s] Sabbath and cannot come to church on\n[524.7s] God's Sabbath day Sabbath you can come\n[527.1s] on Sunday mornings\n[529.0s] and our church\n[531.1s] why the logo has changed the merchandise\n[535.2s] has also changed\n[538.1s] that's it\n[540.1s] it would it would be weird as I said\n[542.6s] bizarre as I said this morning you walk\n[545.3s] into a Bed Bath and Beyond store and you\n[548.5s] see no what do they sell inside there\n[553.1s] so clothing they sell soap\n[557.5s] okay bath soap right okay and what else\n[560.8s] Etc you walk inside there and what are\n[563.1s] they selling\n[564.5s] watermelon\n[566.2s] cantaloupe come on now it's it's it's\n[568.8s] it's it's fall season okay\n[572.1s] broccoli\n[573.5s] collards\n[575.1s] right you would say where am I\n[578.7s] the sign is correct but the merchandise\n[581.8s] is incorrect or they don't have the sign\n[586.3s] and don't have the message\n[589.1s] Luke chapter 12 go to verse 1. it says\n[592.2s] be weary after laughing of whom the\n[595.7s] Pharisees which is what friends\n[598.3s] hypocrisy hypocrisy and that's why this\n[601.7s] morning I spent time on this\n[606.4s] this is God's true sign\n[610.3s] past that won't spend time on this okay\n[612.8s] everybody read the red words with me I\n[615.8s] was told that men will employ every\n[619.4s] policy to make less prominent the\n[622.1s] difference between the faith our\n[624.1s] Seventh-Day Adventists and those who\n[626.6s] observe the first day of the week past\n[629.2s] that all right friends okay now notice\n[632.6s] again they will say we must remove the\n[636.4s] banner or sign the banner or sign and\n[641.2s] what sign that God put on his building\n[643.1s] what sign is on new Jerusalem's\n[646.5s] Tabernacle the Angels at the gates on\n[650.1s] the Tabernacle gate and Tabernacle past\n[652.1s] that won't spend time on that okay I saw\n[655.0s] some reaching out their hands to remove\n[657.2s] the banner and to obscure fix that and\n[660.4s] to obscure its significance I don't want\n[663.5s] to keep you here too long all right\n[664.8s] let's move on from this\n[666.8s] we cannot know and what they want to say\n[670.1s] friends those who are standing faithful\n[673.1s] to God\n[674.8s] in observing the true message and the\n[678.7s] true logo that they are the ones who\n[681.5s] have started a new organization\n[684.9s] now I I wish I had something here\n[688.5s] on what side of the four corners or four\n[692.1s] sides of the sanctuary it was the good\n[694.5s] place on what side\n[696.3s] East Side so they traveled from where\n[699.2s] East to where West so what what\n[703.4s] direction did the Angels cherubims fly\n[707.8s] east to west from the gate to where the\n[711.5s] door of the Tabernacle holy Place inner\n[714.8s] Veil and then most holy is traveling\n[717.4s] we're east to west and that's why by\n[719.8s] God's grace we turn our logo with the\n[723.6s] angels with trumpets not going right to\n[727.0s] left\n[728.3s] but what\n[730.1s] not going left to right but what right\n[733.4s] to left East to West so when someone\n[736.3s] sees safe to serve's logo\n[739.9s] they'll ask a question why are your\n[742.4s] angels flying right to left\n[745.2s] what will you say\n[746.9s] let's go to the sanctuary\n[749.7s] these cherubims fly how right to left\n[753.5s] East to West will you say Amen friends\n[755.8s] we have to make sure we come as close to\n[759.2s] scripture as possible\n[762.0s] it's a sign\n[766.1s] what if someone says come meet me here\n[768.6s] and remove you remember we were going to\n[772.0s] evangelize and evangelist John Ryan sent\n[775.9s] me this uh the direction\n[778.3s] and instead of putting let's say other\n[780.6s] member of the address instead of putting\n[782.4s] uh John's Road he put John's Avenue\n[787.2s] well here we have John 1 and John's\n[789.5s] Avenue\n[790.8s] I'm looking for John's Avenue when it\n[793.2s] should be John's Road\n[795.0s] but John is correct but what's incorrect\n[798.4s] Avenue or road is it important now which\n[802.0s] direction you're flying\n[804.4s] or brothers and sisters is it important\n[806.4s] all right let's move on from that there\n[809.8s] it is friends you know what let's turn\n[811.7s] the first Timothy chapter three go there\n[814.3s] with me and First Timothy chapter three\n[817.6s] and verse number 16 God's word says uh\n[822.3s] without controversy great is the mystery\n[827.0s] of godliness\n[828.8s] greatest watch Friends the mystery of\n[832.4s] godliness\n[834.6s] and there is a controversy going on\n[837.2s] right now\n[838.4s] and that controversy is stay in the SDA\n[842.9s] churches\n[844.1s] versus\n[847.2s] come out of apostasy is that clear\n[850.1s] friends\n[851.0s] and those who give the latter cry come\n[854.0s] out of apostasy\n[856.3s] those in the former group who say you're\n[859.3s] calling people out of the SDA Church\n[863.5s] that's what they say\n[865.3s] that's hypocrisy that's not correct they\n[868.4s] are creating what we call a straw man\n[872.2s] because Andrew Enriquez yours truly have\n[874.8s] never said come out of SDA churches\n[879.3s] you have ordered me what have I always\n[881.2s] say\n[882.6s] come out of what a past State local SDA\n[886.8s] churches\n[888.1s] as well as come out of a prostate\n[892.0s] non-conference churches it goes both\n[895.0s] ways\n[897.1s] but when they preach and teach they're\n[899.4s] calling you to church organization\n[902.9s] volume 4 page two go to Isaiah chapter\n[905.6s] one where are you going to my friends\n[908.2s] Isaiah chapter one what makes our\n[911.3s] Seventh-day Adventist one more time red\n[913.9s] words notice how sister white quoted in\n[917.1s] the blue words the Three Angels messages\n[920.3s] of course she mentioned first and second\n[923.1s] that's present truth then she said a red\n[926.3s] word those who pass through these\n[929.0s] experiences are to be as firm as a rock\n[932.5s] to the principles that have made us what\n[936.1s] everybody Seventh Day Adventist volume\n[939.5s] what's that volume nine\n[942.1s] testimonies for the church volume 9 page\n[945.2s] 48 says let ministers and people bear in\n[948.9s] mind there may affect that their names\n[952.0s] are registered on the church's books\n[956.5s] will not save them oh but I thought if\n[959.8s] your name is not on a local conference\n[962.8s] SDA Church you're not going to be saved\n[968.7s] that was volume nine what page I gave\n[971.0s] you page 48 pass this won't spend time\n[974.9s] on that I covered that this morning we\n[977.6s] cannot now enter into any new\n[980.2s] Organization for this would mean a pass\n[983.8s] to see from the word everybody apostasy\n[986.5s] from the truth now watch this

as a body if we start teaching things\n[1262.6s] it's not biblical I'm going to leave I'm\n[1264.6s] leaving because my loyalty is to God\n[1266.7s] where's your loyalty\n[1269.5s] he's leaving where's he going\n[1273.3s] look at what is situated\n[1276.9s] on the bottom right of the screen what\n[1279.3s] is that\n[1281.1s] a logo\n[1282.4s] what is that\n[1283.9s] how many of you recall the first three\n[1285.8s] ABN logo\n[1287.4s] was that it\n[1288.8s] come on what's that it\n[1290.5s] was that it what is that\n[1295.2s] imagine God saying sinner come to this\n[1298.0s] Tabernacle with cherubims and he walks\n[1300.6s] up and you see three lines\n[1302.2s] where is the sign\n[1306.8s] so he may need to pack his bags right\n[1309.7s] but where is he going\n[1311.8s] and the Very sins he's protesting\n[1314.2s] against\n[1315.9s] in Loma Linda elsewhere\n[1319.0s] have been supported by leadership in the\n[1322.0s] general conference why do I say that the\n[1324.6s] mere fact that there are moaned and\n[1327.3s] silent\n[1328.6s] on the point it means that they're\n[1330.7s] complicit with the same apostasis\n[1334.5s] am I clear\n[1335.9s] all the points playing let's pray for\n[1338.0s] The Elder here let's move on my friends\n[1340.0s] watch this this is a controversial\n[1343.0s] statement\n[1344.1s] that has been floating around seventh\n[1347.4s] day adventism\n[1349.2s] and normally in Sabbath afternoons this\n[1352.0s] time around after evangelism we will go\n[1355.1s] into question and answer question and\n[1358.0s] answer so this question was posed\n[1361.0s] was posed\n[1363.2s] this statement is found on the white eg1\n[1368.7s] estate of egy writings all right friends\n[1372.5s] now this red box two small paragraphs\n[1376.2s] I'm gonna magnify those two paragraphs\n[1379.6s] okay it was written in 1901 September\n[1383.8s] 24th okay and many use this statement to\n[1389.4s] say\n[1390.1s] it doesn't matter what's happening in\n[1392.5s] the church stay in the churches now\n[1394.9s] watch there's no qualification given\n[1399.7s] so if there's apostasy in that local\n[1403.2s] church stay right there\n[1405.6s] say right there supported supported we I\n[1408.7s] don't teach that\n[1409.9s] wherever apostasy is among leadership\n[1413.7s] after you pray with after you consult\n[1417.8s] with if they continue to promote and\n[1421.4s] teach them the heresy\n[1423.6s] you should not stay there based on the\n[1426.4s] Bible and the spirit of Prophecy you\n[1428.3s] should not find somewhere else and go\n[1430.3s] you should not because by beholding you\n[1433.5s] become one changed and once you stay\n[1436.7s] there and support it you strengthen the\n[1439.8s] apostates\n[1441.3s] I'm not speaking about the pews\n[1443.4s] leadership I'm talking about\n[1446.0s] all right so we are going to be\n[1448.3s] addressing this statement here watch\n[1450.6s] carefully so friends here it is let not\n[1453.6s] the professed people of God think it's a\n[1456.7s] privilege to separate from conference\n[1460.6s] organization that they may show their\n[1464.0s] supposed efficiency and I think our\n[1466.5s] sisters here who also asked this\n[1468.2s] question several weeks ago\n[1470.4s] red words this is entirely opposed to\n[1474.2s] God's word\n[1476.2s] this is what friends\n[1477.9s] no no please talk back to me so I'm so\n[1480.4s] I'm clear that you're following the\n[1482.2s] bouncing ball this is entirely opposed\n[1485.5s] to God's order what is entirely opposed\n[1487.9s] to God's order\n[1490.0s] to separate from what conference\n[1492.4s] organization let's read on there is need\n[1496.0s] of perfect unity and love and this will\n[1499.9s] appear when we learn of Jesus it is the\n[1503.5s] plan of God that every church and every\n[1506.7s] conference shall cherish the feeling of\n[1509.7s] reciprocal dependence what friends\n[1512.8s] depending on each other or I depend on\n[1515.6s] you you depend on me reciprocal okay let\n[1518.3s] me ask you a question\n[1519.5s] if I say to you that this statement in\n[1522.4s] 1901 shouldn't you get every other\n[1525.1s] statement in sister-watch writings about\n[1528.3s] Ministries comma churches comma\n[1532.7s] publishing houses comma medical\n[1535.9s] missionary institutions comma not being\n[1540.7s] under schools comma not being under the\n[1543.9s] conference would you say Amen to that\n[1546.2s] that one statement Must Destroy every\n[1548.8s] other\n[1551.2s] who with intelligence would reason like\n[1554.5s] that\n[1556.0s] you take one statement that says it's\n[1559.3s] not in God's order to separate from the\n[1562.3s] conference organization use that to\n[1565.2s] destroy every other statement\n[1567.7s] that says the opposite and say look when\n[1570.9s] you read those are the statements they\n[1573.2s] must be understood based on this one\n[1576.4s] how could that be\n[1578.7s] that's the same argument the Sunday\n[1581.1s] people use to justify Sunday\n[1585.4s] what year is that written in\n[1587.9s] 1901 right September look at the\n[1590.4s] statement here\n[1591.3s] what year is this at the bottom\n[1593.9s] 1907 to whom their sister went right\n[1598.8s] Elder Daniels was actually the general\n[1601.9s] conference president\n[1604.4s] watch this statement when my advice was\n[1607.5s] asked in reference\n[1609.3s] to the Madison School the watch School\n[1612.1s] now when you hear school you're thinking\n[1614.3s] uh classroom setting\n[1617.2s] theater style uh a lectern and teacher\n[1621.9s] the Madison School means an Enterprise\n[1625.2s] right setting up training centers and\n[1629.6s] raising up schools churches medical\n[1633.2s] missionary sites and Publishing houses\n[1636.8s] watch this by the way let's go there\n[1639.3s] because I put it in your mind listen\n[1642.0s] located 10 miles Northeast of Nashville\n[1645.3s] Madison was an important spot in early\n[1649.8s] Southern Seventh-Day adventism\n[1653.7s] the Madison property often referred to\n[1656.9s] as a medicine farm so you have\n[1658.6s] management School management Farm was\n[1661.2s] purchased in what year\n[1663.1s] 1904 with the financial assistance of\n[1667.3s] Nelly uh Gillard and the prophetic\n[1671.1s] vision of Ellen White it says\n[1673.9s] spearheaded by EA Sutherland Percy Megan\n[1679.1s] the medicine contingent contingent now\n[1682.6s] would spawn a collection of what schools\n[1686.4s] hospitals Industries and what churches\n[1689.9s] around the South\n[1691.9s] so what were they establishing\n[1695.6s] all right watch careful now let's go\n[1699.2s] right here I'll come back to that watch\n[1701.8s] us now friends it says when my advice\n[1704.7s] was asked in reference to the Madison\n[1707.7s] School I said remain as you are there is\n[1712.9s] danger in binding every working agency\n[1717.7s] everyone\n[1719.8s] Elder Buchanan I mean should I go there\n[1722.7s] now\n[1723.9s] you say no are you my conscience\n[1726.2s] preacher listen I agree with you there\n[1729.1s] is a danger in binding every working\n[1732.0s] agency under the what friends the\n[1735.4s] dictation of the conference the Lord did\n[1738.6s] not design that this should be\n[1742.3s] so friends which statement was inspired\n[1744.7s] the 1901 or 1907 which one\n[1750.0s] which one was inspired\n[1752.5s] which one\n[1754.0s] both were inspired\n[1756.4s] so why the difference circumstances\n[1760.5s] what's the difference\n[1762.4s] circumstances now here is a counter\n[1765.1s] argument to this statement here on the\n[1767.3s] screen\n[1768.8s] some would say well that's true that's\n[1771.9s] how medicine began\n[1774.7s] not with the conference but later on in\n[1777.9s] years right later on maybe a decade\n[1780.7s] after or so some of the various\n[1783.7s] institutions they established came back\n[1786.9s] under the conference\n[1788.8s] so that means you must negate this\n[1791.1s] instruction here\n[1792.6s] who is in that way\n[1794.7s] because circumstances\n[1797.3s] changed does not destroy the council\n[1801.8s] that was given\n[1804.9s] have ever read in the Bible the Lord\n[1807.7s] repented\n[1809.8s] have you\n[1811.6s] why would God repent\n[1814.1s] that would be a good Bible question\n[1817.4s] so let me not give too much on that okay\n[1819.6s] but why did God repent\n[1823.4s] because circumstances changed so he\n[1827.8s] promised destruction right and what\n[1830.1s] happened it was coming but they were\n[1833.6s] they repented so God withheld it God\n[1838.1s] repented oh that's the answer right dear\n[1839.9s] friends can God sin\n[1841.9s] so repent it doesn't mean to sin and\n[1843.9s] repent and to convert amen so God\n[1846.7s] changed because\n[1848.3s] circumstances change he withheld\n[1851.2s] destruction one example Nineveh\n[1854.7s] minivan amen it's clear\n[1858.5s] God withheld destruction let's continue\n[1861.0s] it says the Lord did not design that\n[1864.4s] this should be what are the next two\n[1866.7s] words in blue\n[1870.3s] the circumstances were such\n[1873.1s] the burden-bearers in the Madison School\n[1876.4s] could not bind up their work with the\n[1879.6s] conference\n[1881.7s] I knew their situation and when many of\n[1885.3s] the leading men in our conferences\n[1888.3s] ignore them because they did not Place\n[1891.8s] their school\n[1893.6s] under the\n[1895.6s] the conference dictation I was shown\n[1898.6s] that they would not be helped by making\n[1902.0s] themselves amenable to what the\n[1905.5s] conference they had better remain as led\n[1909.1s] by God amenable to him to work out his\n[1913.3s] plans but this matter need not be blazed\n[1919.0s] abroad\n[1920.5s] so friends what if the circumstances\n[1924.1s] that were Rife and prevalent in this\n[1929.1s] time 1907\n[1930.9s] when the instruction was given what if\n[1933.9s] they are prevalent today\n[1937.1s] would it be okay then to follow the same\n[1939.6s] instructions\n[1942.2s] or do you not believe in inspiration\n[1946.2s] is inspiration\n[1948.3s] it was given because of circle says\n[1952.2s] are they alive in the world today so how\n[1955.3s] could you negate the statement and\n[1957.3s] because they can they say well later on\n[1959.8s] some of those churches were brought\n[1962.6s] under the conference\n[1964.4s] does that negate the instruction\n[1968.0s] sometimes men reason as if they are\n[1972.6s] infants\n[1974.7s] and it's either they are ignorant listen\n[1977.4s] attentively either they are ignorant or\n[1980.5s] they lack comprehension skills they lack\n[1983.8s] intelligence or they have a Sinister\n[1986.8s] agenda\n[1988.6s] I wonder what it is which one let's move\n[1991.2s] on Modern paragraph\n[1993.0s] it says means have been held from them\n[1996.3s] Madison because in the organization and\n[2000.2s] management of the Madison School it was\n[2003.3s] not placed under the control of the\n[2006.6s] conference\n[2008.8s] but the reason why this school wasn't\n[2012.2s] owned and controlled by the conference\n[2014.7s] have not been duly considered move on\n[2019.1s] then she said watch carefully friends\n[2022.4s] how much of this I want to give you\n[2025.2s] watch carefully you want all of it some\n[2027.2s] with all of it red words Huntsville\n[2030.2s] first sentence\n[2032.1s] Alabama Madison listen in the matter of\n[2036.0s] the Madison School there has been a\n[2038.5s] standing off from them because they were\n[2041.0s] not under the ownership and control of\n[2044.8s] some conference\n[2046.4s] all right it says this is a question\n[2050.3s] thou should sometimes be considered but\n[2054.0s] it is not the Lord's plan\n[2056.7s] that means should be withheld from\n[2059.9s] medicine because they were what\n[2063.0s] I want to ask you a question\n[2065.1s] what\n[2067.7s] antithesis do we hear to that statement\n[2072.9s] every tithe every offering must go weird\n[2081.5s] huh so you hear one thing but read\n[2084.5s] something else\n[2086.6s] Luke 12 verse 1 Beware of the hypocrisy\n[2091.1s] of the Pharisees the leaven of the\n[2094.3s] leaders hypocrisy that's what it says\n[2096.5s] right there that means means can go to\n[2099.2s] where institutions not connected to the\n[2102.7s] conference\n[2104.4s] let's read on\n[2105.8s] the attitude with some of our Brethren\n[2110.4s] have assumed\n[2112.8s] toward this Enterprise shows it is not\n[2116.7s] wise for every every working agency to\n[2120.8s] be under the dictation of conference\n[2123.6s] officers there are Harmony they're all\n[2127.1s] is that what sister white wrote they're\n[2129.3s] all no there are some\n[2132.7s] Enterprises on the one certain\n[2135.9s] conditions that will produce better\n[2138.6s] results if one standing alone\n[2143.0s] that's abc123\n[2148.8s] is that clear friends\n[2151.5s] now that's why you you would never hear\n[2154.4s] yours truly say\n[2156.7s] every church is in apostasy or everybody\n[2159.8s] come what I'm simply calling people out\n[2163.6s] of War apostasy wherever it is\n[2166.7s] conference lines or self-supporting\n[2169.8s] lines\n[2171.1s] now do we have to wait second do we have\n[2175.0s] to wait to see apostasy\n[2178.2s] and use that as the reason to stand\n[2181.1s] alone\n[2182.2s] no no no you don't have to give me a\n[2186.5s] Biblical example of that\n[2188.4s] where somebody didn't work with the\n[2191.2s] conference the sanhegan council but yet\n[2193.7s] stood alone in Ministry John the Baptist\n[2197.4s] who was he by the way before I get to\n[2199.7s] Christ who was he by the way John the\n[2201.3s] Baptist whose son was he\n[2204.4s] Zacharias who was Zacharias\n[2207.1s] high priest so in the natural order of\n[2210.5s] things\n[2211.4s] what and who what office should John the\n[2215.6s] Baptist have assumed\n[2219.3s] high priest priesthood but what happened\n[2221.8s] God didn't call him to become a high\n[2224.7s] priest a pastor an elder in the\n[2227.9s] Sanhedrin Conference of synagogues he\n[2231.5s] had a self-supporting and independent\n[2234.0s] Ministry of the conference\n[2239.7s] song\n[2240.9s] Enterprises can stand alone\n[2244.5s] I'm going to say this\n[2247.0s] many of these men\n[2249.3s] they frame their talking points as if\n[2253.3s] there's only one side\n[2255.8s] that has an issue\n[2257.9s] as if you folks over here who are\n[2260.4s] self-supporting you despise the brethren\n[2263.9s] in the conference and separate yourself\n[2266.6s] you will never hear them look on the\n[2268.9s] other angle\n[2270.3s] and say those men in the conference\n[2272.7s] don't want to hear truth\n[2276.9s] hypocrisy\n[2279.1s] and they in the conference will never\n[2281.8s] invite some men to come and preach in\n[2284.1s] their pulpits\n[2286.3s] it's always one perspective\n[2289.5s] Sinister agenda\n[2291.7s] when you can be balanced\n[2293.9s] you can be bought and sold you're a\n[2297.1s] Slave\n[2298.5s] let's move on from that I told you\n[2301.4s] you're going to get it\n[2303.0s] what year is this at the bottom what\n[2305.1s] year\n[2306.9s] what year\n[2308.9s] do you remember hold on because\n[2310.3s] everything I say I must give you\n[2312.4s] receipts receipts you remember a man\n[2315.6s] whose name is he's alive Bill not\n[2319.5s] and he wrote an article says time to\n[2323.4s] marginalize\n[2325.2s] he says it's time to ostracize men like\n[2329.4s] dog Bachelor\n[2331.9s] anyone\n[2333.4s] who preaches against women's ordination\n[2338.2s] should not be brought into SDA pulpits\n[2341.6s] what is that\n[2343.4s] separation right\n[2346.4s] let's come here what year is this on the\n[2349.7s] screen friends\n[2350.9s] 1903 okay notice now this is Ellen White\n[2355.4s] and she's speaking of her son Edson\n[2358.5s] white that's the first two sentences\n[2361.3s] blue words just a white rights he it's\n[2364.9s] in white her son will be accounted out\n[2368.3s] of what\n[2369.4s] out of line but many\n[2373.1s] ought to be out of the lines that have\n[2376.2s] been maintained to be the regular\n[2378.8s] routine\n[2380.5s] how many\n[2381.8s] no some few many and unless they\n[2386.9s] themselves the conference line come into\n[2390.2s] line they will say we are God's Church\n[2395.2s] so the conference Brethren will say we\n[2398.3s] are God's Temple we are God's Church\n[2401.4s] sister white says unless that Temple is\n[2404.7s] purified cleansed and Sanctified God\n[2407.6s] would not give them his presence in the\n[2410.3s] temple of which they boast\n[2412.9s] those who would have rejoiced to see\n[2415.4s] something done\n[2416.7s] were all determined to give one no\n[2420.2s] recognition to whom it's in white as a\n[2423.6s] person or the one his work\n[2426.6s] why because he did not work in the\n[2431.8s] break what is a regular lines the\n[2434.0s] conference what year is that\n[2437.2s] but they caught 1901.\n[2440.3s] now which one\n[2442.3s] which one came after 1901\n[2445.9s] oh friends listen God has presented\n[2449.7s] before you how he regarded the regular\n[2453.5s] lines it says it needs to be broken as a\n[2458.0s] word a partridge vessel is broken\n[2461.0s] and what reconstructed how could you say\n[2464.3s] 1901 Must Destroy this statement\n[2468.1s] put this reference down\n[2470.1s] in great controversy\n[2474.8s] 371 sister white rights she says\n[2479.5s] not one statement should be used not\n[2484.4s] once saying of Christ let's fix it\n[2486.7s] properly not one thing of Christ should\n[2490.6s] be used to destroy another you can't do\n[2494.8s] that friends they're all inspired let's\n[2497.6s] let's move on\n[2499.0s] now look at this statement here what\n[2502.2s] year is that at the bottom\n[2505.5s] 1907\n[2507.0s] where was Sister white in 1907 or even\n[2510.3s] before 1907 where was she because I mean\n[2513.5s] that was when it was written where was\n[2515.0s] she what was she doing she said the\n[2518.7s] churches\n[2519.8s] that her son established outside of the\n[2523.8s] conference she was there to dedicate\n[2526.1s] those churches\n[2528.1s] 1907.\n[2529.8s] now here is a counter argument yeah but\n[2532.9s] some of those churches decades after\n[2535.8s] were brought back into the conference\n[2538.1s] does that negate the statement\n[2543.0s] ignorance a lack of mental Acumen Lord\n[2547.1s] have mercy let's move on from that and\n[2549.8s] there it is\n[2551.2s] stay as you are you don't need to unite\n[2554.3s] with them\n[2555.3s] all right what year is this first line\n[2558.5s] blue words\n[2560.1s] 1901 who is Sister what writing to\n[2564.6s] who was A.G Daniels\n[2567.2s] General Conference president and what\n[2570.2s] does she write she says pharisaism red\n[2573.8s] words Ferry says him in the Christian\n[2576.5s] world is what not extinct\n[2580.1s] she says in the SDA church we have a\n[2583.8s] Pharisees him\n[2585.8s] so she's connecting\n[2588.4s] the Sanhedrin council with the General\n[2592.2s] Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists\n[2597.6s] what year is that in 1901 what does she\n[2601.1s] say the regular lines may prove a\n[2605.0s] failure and a want a sneer\n[2608.1s] conference lines for instance 1901.\n[2611.2s] 1901 again she says shall the regular\n[2616.0s] lines which say every mind shall be what\n[2620.2s] what's the word controlled\n[2623.5s] not every working agency church should\n[2627.8s] be under the control of the conference\n[2630.6s] 1903 1907 1901 how many more statements\n[2635.6s] you want\n[2637.0s] every mind shall be controlled by two or\n[2639.7s] three Minds at Battle Creek continue to\n[2642.7s] Bear Swift well oh pastor we have 13\n[2645.5s] divisions now\n[2647.2s] we have more than two or three\n[2649.8s] it's not the amount of men is what\n[2651.9s] you're teaching\n[2653.3s] and what they're supporting and\n[2654.8s] promoting that's the problem because if\n[2657.2s] you have how many how many men\n[2660.0s] ruled Israel in the time of King Saul\n[2665.1s] was it not Samuel\n[2666.7s] was he faithful to God\n[2668.8s] let's move on shall men go\n[2671.9s] to the regular lines to see whether they\n[2675.6s] will be permitted to labor or shall they\n[2678.6s] go out and work as best they can\n[2683.0s] depending on their own work\n[2686.9s] we don't need their ordination nor their\n[2690.2s] approval go to work for God all right\n[2693.6s] friend how much more let me see\n[2696.2s] something here all right 1901 James\n[2700.1s] Edson white she says the Lord has\n[2703.4s] blessed my son in the south\n[2705.5s] second sentence God grant that the\n[2709.0s] voices which have been so quickly raised\n[2712.7s] to say that all the money\n[2716.0s] invested in the work must go through the\n[2720.6s] appointed Channel at Battle Creek shall\n[2723.5s] what\n[2725.1s] not be heard\n[2726.5s] Battle Creek today is what now\n[2730.2s] there in Spring\n[2731.9s] Michigan or\n[2734.4s] the one in in Maryland DC\n[2737.6s] Silver Spring Maryland it is their\n[2741.1s] privilege to give what direct Aid and\n[2744.3s] what assistance to missions that's it\n[2747.5s] friends it's clear\n[2749.1s] there it is again Edson white past that\n[2752.1s] friends write this down that reference\n[2754.8s] please very very important\n[2757.2s] it says it is as hard today\n[2761.1s] to break away from what what\n[2764.6s] did you all hear that everybody read\n[2768.3s] words what it says it is as hard today\n[2773.5s] to break away from the regular lines as\n[2779.0s] it was in whose day in Christ's day\n[2782.5s] what does Breakaway mean\n[2786.5s] huh what does Breakaway mean\n[2792.2s] listen we have had great light let us\n[2796.4s] not become narrow let us break the bonds\n[2800.7s] which bind us\n[2803.5s] hard to break away from what\n[2806.3s] the regular lines\n[2810.6s] now is Sister white saying Everybody\n[2812.6s] Must Break Free at the conference\n[2815.1s] but where their circumstances you can\n[2817.8s] stand how separate alone with Christ\n[2821.4s] with Christ with Christ okay go to John\n[2825.5s] 15.\n[2827.0s] do you know what is startling among\n[2828.8s] these men\n[2830.3s] they give you several quotes and hardly\n[2834.0s] no Bible\n[2836.2s] no Bible\n[2837.5s] and that's why their statements and\n[2840.7s] arguments are convoluted\n[2844.5s] as we would say Tom foodery\n[2846.7s] where are we going to John what chapter\n[2848.5s] go to John 15. what does verse 1 say in\n[2852.0s] John 15 friends what does Christ saying\n[2855.5s] I am the what the true vine listen to\n[2859.8s] what sister white says Bible Spirit of\n[2861.9s] Prophecy this is the Desire of Ages\n[2866.1s] she writes I am the True Vine listen the\n[2870.0s] Jews had always regarded\n[2873.4s] the vine as the most noble of plants\n[2877.8s] and a type of all that was powerful\n[2881.5s] excellent and fruitful\n[2884.6s] Israel had been what\n[2887.0s] represented as a what Vine\n[2890.3s] which God had planted red words the Jews\n[2895.2s] based the hope of Salvation on the fact\n[2899.1s] of what friends their connection with\n[2902.0s] Israel\n[2904.9s] can Church connection save anybody\n[2909.0s] what saves What Not Who what saves truth\n[2913.1s] who saves\n[2914.6s] who is he the way the truth the life\n[2918.6s] listen what Christ now says I am the\n[2922.7s] real Vine think not that through a\n[2927.0s] connection with the church you may\n[2929.8s] become partakers of the life of God and\n[2934.2s] inheritors of his promise\n[2937.1s] so me alone a spiritual life received\n[2941.9s] that Bible and spirit of Prophecy\n[2946.0s] how then could you believe that sister\n[2948.8s] white is going to write anything\n[2950.6s] different\n[2953.2s] John 15 let's move on\n[2956.1s] sister white rights the Pharisees\n[2958.9s] declared themselves the children of\n[2962.1s] Abraham\n[2964.5s] Christ told them that this claim could\n[2967.9s] be established only by doing what the\n[2971.5s] works of Abraham\n[2974.1s] blue words a mere lineal descent from\n[2978.8s] Abraham was of no value without a\n[2983.1s] spiritual connection with Christ your\n[2986.1s] connection means nothing\n[2989.8s] and that's what they're preaching stay\n[2992.1s] in the church they're preaching\n[2994.2s] salvation through the church\n[2996.6s] and people are eating and drinking that\n[2999.6s] Hook Line and Sinker deceive they\n[3002.5s] haven't read nor prayed over this for\n[3005.3s] themselves\n[3006.7s] one more statement all the Desire of\n[3009.2s] Ages\n[3010.3s] all right it says descent do I want this\n[3014.1s] one\n[3015.7s] you could take note of the reference\n[3018.1s] I'll move on from this one okay\n[3020.9s] argue for this one page 107 paragraph\n[3024.0s] one John the Baptist said the ax is laid\n[3028.3s] weird at the root\n[3030.5s] red words not by its name but by its\n[3035.3s] fruit is the value of a tree determined\n[3040.1s] if the fruit is worthless\n[3044.2s] the name cannot save the tree from\n[3048.6s] oh\n[3050.6s] would the name save you was Seventh-Day\n[3054.1s] Adventists save you I cannot save you\n[3056.8s] what must we have what must we reveal\n[3059.9s] what must we manifest the fruit last\n[3063.7s] sentence profession was profession is\n[3068.8s] worthless\n[3071.2s] if our lives and characters are not in\n[3075.2s] harmony with God's law we are not his\n[3079.2s] people\n[3083.3s] and Christ made this statement John 15\n[3086.7s] before he was crucified\n[3090.1s] and Christ's crucifixion typifies the\n[3093.1s] sunderl\n[3095.5s] it's relevant right now and applicable\n[3097.6s] let me see how much more of this I can\n[3099.6s] give you than I'll close\n[3102.6s] go to Matthew 15.\n[3105.1s] where are we going to friends\n[3107.6s] Matthew 15.\n[3109.4s] let's take this Matthew 15 look at verse\n[3113.1s] 7.\n[3114.7s] what did Christ preacher give me 10.\n[3118.7s] what did Christ preach in verse 7 and\n[3121.7s] call the leaders\n[3123.7s] Hypocrites right Hypocrites skip one\n[3126.9s] down with me to verse number nine what\n[3129.5s] were they teaching\n[3132.9s] men's doctrines\n[3135.4s] all right for God's Commandments and\n[3138.8s] they were worshiping God in vain skip on\n[3141.1s] down to verse number verse number 12.\n[3145.3s] the disciples came to Christ Lord you\n[3148.9s] offended\n[3150.6s] the leaders of the church\n[3153.7s] Christ the Christ apologize\n[3157.3s] he said nothing wrong he spoke present\n[3160.3s] truth no need for apology look at verse\n[3163.7s] number 14. what did Christ say now verse\n[3166.0s] 13 every plan\n[3168.0s] my father\n[3169.5s] had not planted shall be won rooted up\n[3172.6s] let them alone what\n[3176.0s] look at the statement\n[3177.7s] the disciples had been much disappointed\n[3182.0s] that Jesus had not tried to secure what\n[3186.6s] everybody\n[3189.2s] the cooperation of the leaders in Israel\n[3194.0s] they felt it was a mistake for Jesus not\n[3199.1s] to strengthen his cause by securing the\n[3203.2s] support\n[3204.3s] of these influential men\n[3207.9s] past Enriquez why do you not work with\n[3211.6s] the conference leaders\n[3214.6s] ask them the same question\n[3216.8s] and reverse it and see what they tell\n[3219.4s] you\n[3220.4s] that's them\n[3223.4s] watch it says the corporation of such\n[3228.4s] men\n[3229.7s] listen as the disciples were anxious to\n[3234.2s] secure would have betrayed the work of\n[3238.0s] God into the hands of its home birth\n[3242.0s] enemies\n[3244.7s] is that clear friends\n[3249.0s] some people will see this and still say\n[3251.5s] I don't see it do you know why\n[3255.8s] they're blind\n[3257.6s] they're blind\n[3259.0s] they're blind\n[3260.8s] they're blind\n[3262.3s] let's go to Lou chapter nine\n[3265.4s] Bible Spirit of Prophecy where we're\n[3267.3s] going to France\n[3269.0s] Luke Chapter now look what this says in\n[3271.1s] Luke chapter 9. let them alone by the\n[3275.3s] way by the way hold your place in Luke 9\n[3277.6s] go to Acts 2 leave them alone\n[3280.9s] acts what chapter now\n[3282.9s] Acts chapter 2. this is on the day of\n[3286.9s] Pentecost right\n[3289.1s] probation had not yet been closed on the\n[3292.7s] Jewish Church look at Acts chapter 2\n[3295.1s] verse 40.\n[3297.9s] the disciples said to the people\n[3301.3s] save yourselves from this world unto\n[3304.9s] Ward Generations what's untoward mean\n[3308.2s] corrupt\n[3309.5s] meaning leave them alone verse 41 they\n[3313.7s] were baptized\n[3315.3s] verse 42 the people after being baptized\n[3320.0s] did they go back\n[3323.6s] to those apostate leaders yes or no did\n[3326.7s] they my friends no they fellowshipped\n[3329.8s] with whom\n[3331.1s] those who had truth\n[3333.6s] those of Our Truth Bible do you remember\n[3336.8s] in John chapter 6\n[3340.6s] when the majority of Christ disciples\n[3343.5s] left him\n[3345.9s] and Christ turned to the twelve and said\n[3349.0s] to them will you also go\n[3351.7s] what did Peter say\n[3354.0s] to whom shall we go\n[3356.2s] you have what the words of eternal life\n[3359.8s] so what were they following\n[3362.3s] truth\n[3363.7s] truth truth but those men went right\n[3366.7s] back to the conference of that day\n[3370.7s] before I take Luke 9 have you ever heard\n[3373.6s] people say\n[3374.7s] to rebut this sister white died in the\n[3378.1s] church\n[3378.9s] I wonder which church you got in\n[3382.5s] sister white preach in the Adventist\n[3384.8s] churches SDA churches\n[3387.2s] she had credentials in the SDA churches\n[3391.3s] so that must be used to negate her\n[3395.0s] statements\n[3396.4s] do you see the fallacy in the reasoning\n[3400.1s] so because she died a Seventh-Day\n[3402.8s] Adventist\n[3404.4s] that must you be used to negate that she\n[3407.4s] says on the several circumstances\n[3411.9s] it's okay for churches Enterprises to\n[3416.2s] stand separate\n[3417.8s] from the conference control\n[3421.6s] who would reason that way\n[3424.4s] want to ask a question\n[3425.9s] did Christ preach in the synagogues\n[3429.2s] did he yes he did did sister white\n[3432.1s] preach in the SDA churches yes she did\n[3436.0s] did Jesus also simultaneously set up a\n[3440.6s] Ministry Church training school\n[3443.5s] baptizing people not with the Sanhedrin\n[3446.9s] yeah did sister white simultaneously\n[3450.1s] support Ministries churches schools not\n[3454.7s] with the conference yeah\n[3461.0s] so where's the problem\n[3463.2s] it's in your minds\n[3464.9s] that's where it is you have a Sinister\n[3467.2s] agenda\n[3468.8s] it's clear for those who want to see it\n[3472.6s] is the Bible true\n[3474.3s] go to Luke 9. Luke 9 you have to use\n[3477.9s] Bible and spread of Prophecy\n[3480.4s] and some people still won't believe this\n[3482.5s] I am simply making sure it's on the\n[3485.8s] record let me hear some my footsteps\n[3487.8s] Luke chapter 9 in verse 49 and John\n[3492.2s] answered\n[3494.0s] Master we saw one doing what casting out\n[3498.3s] devils in thy name\n[3500.4s] what happened we forbade him why\n[3505.0s] because he did not follow us he was not\n[3509.0s] with our ministry\n[3512.9s] do you realize that these were disciples\n[3516.2s] not with the conference\n[3518.6s] and yet they were telling Christ please\n[3520.9s] support seek the approval of the\n[3524.8s] Sanhedrin many of you who are sitting\n[3527.3s] here might have the same sentiment\n[3530.5s] Pastor henriquez I come to save to serve\n[3533.8s] but please work with the conference\n[3535.7s] please\n[3537.5s] the same thing with Christ 12 disciples\n[3542.2s] nothing new Under the Sun\n[3545.1s] nothing new here they are now in Luke 9.\n[3548.9s] they are saying Master this man is not\n[3552.5s] under our ministry and control so he\n[3556.5s] should not be preaching\n[3558.2s] let's do everything on social media to\n[3562.0s] shut him down\n[3563.6s] let's misconstrue statements publish\n[3567.1s] them to deceive the people to stop\n[3569.8s] listening and following him\n[3572.1s] same situation here\n[3574.1s] go to verse 15. what did Christ say now\n[3576.8s] you have done well no\n[3579.3s] forbid him not why\n[3584.4s] listen what sister white says here\n[3586.1s] friend she says watch carefully come on\n[3588.9s] where is it\n[3593.0s] all right\n[3594.8s] she says Master we saw one casting out\n[3598.8s] devils in thy name\n[3600.5s] and that man didn't follow us listen now\n[3603.7s] James and John had taught James and John\n[3608.1s] had thought that in checking this man\n[3611.8s] they had had in view their Lord's honor\n[3615.7s] and listen to me these preachers on\n[3618.8s] social media in the SDA Church they\n[3621.6s] called themselves champions of the faith\n[3624.5s] we are champions for the conference\n[3627.4s] do you know who they are\n[3629.0s] they are modern day Dr EK\n[3632.2s] again\n[3633.8s] who was Dr EK against\n[3637.2s] have you read the book great controversy\n[3640.0s] who was Dr Eck again\n[3642.4s] Martin Luther the Protestant reformer\n[3646.0s] they are the modern day Dr Eric\n[3649.6s] okay listen James and John had thought\n[3653.0s] that in checking this man they had had\n[3656.0s] in viewed their Lord's honor they began\n[3658.7s] to see that their reward\n[3661.4s] they were what so what was at the root\n[3664.3s] of all those polls and videos jealousy\n[3670.2s] jealousy\n[3671.6s] but afterwards they acknowledge their\n[3674.2s] error and accepted Christ's reproof\n[3678.0s] listen none who showed themselves in any\n[3681.4s] way friendly to Christ if they are\n[3684.2s] preaching present truth leave them\n[3687.8s] alone\n[3690.1s] listen now when Jesus was no longer\n[3693.6s] personally among them\n[3695.7s] and the work was left in their hands\n[3698.8s] they must not indulge award narrow\n[3703.3s] exclusive spirit\n[3705.5s] but manifest the same Farm reaching\n[3709.2s] sympathy which they had seen in whom in\n[3712.6s] their master\n[3714.4s] I digress on that point\n[3716.9s] beloved do you realize question for you\n[3721.0s] which of these two men began their\n[3723.7s] Ministry first\n[3725.9s] Jesus or John the Baptist\n[3729.2s] who\n[3730.7s] John the Baptist was John's Ministry\n[3733.3s] with the conference of that day no what\n[3735.4s] about Christ no all right when Christ\n[3738.4s] came on the scene did he say John you\n[3740.6s] have to close up shop\n[3742.1s] you gotta you got to stop Ministry and\n[3744.3s] join me\n[3745.9s] that happen\n[3747.2s] what happened\n[3748.7s] both were working\n[3750.9s] even John disciples didn't say we would\n[3754.4s] stop preaching and John cries no they\n[3757.1s] had separate Ministries\n[3759.8s] that's Bible brothers and sisters Bible\n[3763.6s] Bible\n[3765.2s] this idea of everyone coming under one\n[3768.1s] head is potpourri\n[3769.9s] that's what it is let's close let's\n[3771.7s] close let's close let's close go to\n[3774.2s] numbers 11. where are we going to\n[3777.6s]

right mode to other minds they have not\n[3868.3s] grown up to the first stature of men and\n[3871.9s] women in Christ they simply live the\n[3875.2s] name of Christian but they are not\n[3877.8s] fitted for the work of God\n[3880.6s] and never will be until they are born\n[3884.1s] again and learned their ABCs in the\n[3888.1s] religion of Christ Jesus red words there\n[3891.6s] is hope in One Direction\n[3894.2s] take the young man and woman and place\n[3897.7s] them where they will come as little as\n[3901.3s] possible in contact with who\n[3904.4s] no no Babylon\n[3906.5s] no

when they go to when they go to our\n[3999.7s] schools do they leave\n[4002.5s] without debt or in debt the majority\n[4006.2s] that's not God's will\n[4008.0s] not God's will okay let me close right\n[4009.9s] here\n[4010.7s] beloved\n[4012.0s] I've heard people say\n[4014.5s] only conference churches are going to\n[4017.8s] finish the work\n[4019.7s] only people in the conference listen\n[4022.4s] watch\n[4026.2s] only people in the conference are going\n[4028.6s] to finish the work\n[4030.5s] who believes that raise a hand\n[4032.6s] not one hand come on who believes that\n[4035.0s] only people in the SD a conference will\n[4038.6s] finish the work\n[4040.9s] anything that will transpire in the last\n[4043.8s] days we should find it in the Bible\n[4046.8s] First Advent or before that\n[4049.3s] at the first Advent\n[4051.9s] which men first receive the early reign\n[4059.1s] oh so I'm speaking to myself so Andrew\n[4061.6s] which man first received the early Reign\n[4064.5s] at the first Advent Pentecost the\n[4067.8s] Sanhedrin people or the ones with Christ\n[4072.8s] which one\n[4074.2s] which the latter group the 120\n[4078.3s] to 120.\n[4082.5s] worthy in the upper room\n[4086.0s] where were the others\n[4087.8s] in the dark and synagogues 120. 120.\n[4092.2s] they received the Holy Spirit first\n[4095.5s] I wonder why what were they following\n[4099.3s] truth\n[4100.8s] what were the other folks following\n[4103.7s] man-made tradition do you see his\n[4106.2s] friends\n[4107.1s] hold on but were there some good folks\n[4109.2s] over there\n[4110.5s] you remember Nicodemus\n[4114.1s] Pastor you said you were closing\n[4117.6s] huh you said you were a closing pastor\n[4120.6s] neither Joseph nor Nicodemus had openly\n[4125.3s] accepted Christ while he was living\n[4129.9s] they knew that such a step\n[4133.7s] would exclude them from the conference\n[4137.4s] Sanhedrin and they hope to protect\n[4140.4s] Christ by the influence in its councils\n[4144.0s] what does that mean we can stay in the\n[4146.9s] conference and still preach president\n[4148.5s] truth\n[4150.9s] for a Time they had seemed to succeed\n[4155.8s] listen\n[4157.3s] but the Wily priests\n[4159.9s] seeing their favor to Christ had\n[4162.7s] thwarted their plans\n[4164.6s] in their absence Christ had been what\n[4167.9s] condemned delivered to be crucified now\n[4171.8s] that Christ was dead\n[4173.9s] they no longer Nicodemus no longer what\n[4178.8s] concealed their attachment to him here's\n[4181.6s] my point there's some pastors right now\n[4185.5s] in the SDA conference\n[4187.9s] who are timid\n[4190.0s] and a fruit to stand for all the truth\n[4193.2s] they will stand later on a few a few\n[4196.8s] will stand later on we are biblical\n[4199.2s] example for that I feel that's why you\n[4201.6s] would never hear me say all our in\n[4203.5s] apostasy\n[4204.7s] there are few who will have to come out\n[4207.3s] when Nicodemus and Joseph came out\n[4211.3s] they had to separate themselves from\n[4213.4s] what the apostate leadership they had to\n[4215.8s] the leadership they had to\n[4217.8s] some will come out but those who think\n[4220.3s] now we can stay right here a day is\n[4223.6s] going to come you'll have to make a\n[4225.9s] decision\n[4227.5s] make what a decision\n[4230.7s] that's New Testament what about Obadiah\n[4235.8s] in the time of whom Elijah\n[4239.1s] Obadiah go tell Ahab Elijah is here what\n[4243.3s] if I go and preach the Elijah's message\n[4248.5s] to Ahab Ahab will chop off my head\n[4253.6s] and that's why many conference pastors\n[4256.4s] like Obadiah will not preach the\n[4259.8s] Elijah's message calling even their own\n[4263.3s] superiors to repentance they won't do it\n[4267.0s] why paycheck why retirement why uh what\n[4272.6s] else accolades why they don't want to be\n[4275.7s] diffract why ordination why all of it\n[4279.3s] afraid they're selling out cries for 30\n[4283.0s] pieces of silver\n[4287.1s] 120\n[4288.7s] I'm closing now\n[4291.4s] 120 received\n[4294.6s] the Holy Spirit first and then they went\n[4298.3s] out and began to preach\n[4300.4s] the majority of the Jews had the last\n[4303.7s] opportunity the majority rejected\n[4307.0s] some came in accept the truth among\n[4310.1s] those who came in the Bible says there\n[4312.9s] were priests who came in\n[4315.3s] they were priests let's be faithful to\n[4317.2s] the Bible we don't have to skew the\n[4319.9s] Bible to suit our sinful agenda preach\n[4323.7s] the word\n[4324.9s] some of them will come out of error and\n[4328.3s] stand on the platform of Truth\n[4331.0s] okay what have we learned today\n[4335.0s] were things clearer\n[4337.7s] were things made plain\n[4340.0s] where things may play So if you think\n[4341.9s] only force in the conference will finish\n[4345.2s] this work\n[4346.3s] you are ignorant of the Bible\n[4349.5s] The Men Who first received the early\n[4351.8s] Reign were men not with the conference\n[4355.1s] how will it be in the last days\n[4357.1s] who first will get the lettering\n[4361.3s] oh pastor\n[4362.9s] guys I can't see that\n[4365.4s] only those who are living and following\n[4368.8s] present truth wherever they are they\n[4372.3s] will be the ones and if they're faithful\n[4373.9s] they're not going to be supported by\n[4377.5s] those men and we pray for them\n[4380.8s] do you think Christ prayed for Caiaphas\n[4383.1s] of course he did\n[4385.7s] of course but was he praying for himself\n[4388.0s] no he was not and that's where I close\n[4390.3s] we have to pray for ourselves study for\n[4392.8s] What study for ourselves\n[4395.1s] we cannot just say follow truth we must\n[4398.1s] know truth so we can follow through\n[4400.9s] study for yourselves let's pray\n[4409.5s] Father in heaven\n[4413.1s] thank you for these words this evening\n[4416.4s] may we take heed\n[4418.6s] to what we have heard may we be found\n[4421.1s] faithful\n[4422.6s] firmly standing upon the Bible and\n[4425.6s] spirit of Prophecy\n[4427.1s] what you have joined together may we not\n[4430.2s] put asunder or separate in order\n[4433.7s] to accommodate our jealousies Envy\n[4437.8s] towards others and our Sinister\n[4441.1s] ulterior motives\n[4443.3s] may we Heavenly Father\n[4446.5s] be found as living examples of your\n[4449.2s] truth may we not keep the angels\n[4453.1s] on the outside\n[4454.6s] in books on buildings on papers\n[4458.9s] but may we allow them to come into our\n[4461.5s] hearts convict convert and may we now go\n[4465.2s] and share with others may we not eat the\n[4468.6s] leaven\n[4469.6s] of the apostates may we shun it and call\n[4473.1s] people to truth\n[4474.9s] may this place be a lighthouse\n[4477.6s] locally and internationally\n[4481.2s] now Lord we pray as we meet this new\n[4484.1s] week\n[4486.4s] Keep Us Faithful may we claim Matthew 6\n[4490.6s] give us this day our daily bread and may\n[4495.1s] we not doubt you will provide\n[4498.4s] Lord we love you\n[4500.1s] and we know you love us\n[4502.2s] may we grow to love you more reflect\n[4505.5s] your character more\n[4507.8s] we will face crises daily this week but\n[4511.7s] may we remember to claim your promises\n[4514.8s] put pep in our Step Prayer endurance\n[4518.2s] patience with a song to remove\n[4520.6s] discouragement\n[4522.5s] we thank you for hearing us prepare us\n[4525.0s] for tomorrow midday power surge wherein\n[4528.3s] We Begin the series\n[4530.7s] seven last days on

times when Jesus was being born again same here Moses the devil wanted to reduce the numbers of the people when Jesus was being born the same scenario was happening again so it shall be in the last days haha getting the point so that is where the world is God's people should stand on the platform of Eternal truth you see God will only protect his people as we do everything in our powers to obey every lies that God has himself only those who are living up to the right they have will receive additional light is now the Lord has laid in his word the exact part that you would want his people to follow the path of self-denight the path of righteousness and holiness and to the Lord is misery now wow after the ten place they had witnessed the power and the Providence of God had wrote miraculously in their behalf Anya maku they had seen the ten plagues fall in Egyptians it was the greatest miracles of all miracles they had seen the sea coming together and cover their enemies what are the Miracles what they do it and the Bible is specific in the Book of Micah chapter 6 verse 4 let us begin our discourse now Micah chapter 6 verses number four Micah we are reading some will call it Mika or Mica Micah chapter six amen amen Micah chapter six verse verse 4 the Bible says for I brought thee up out of the land of egyptia and redeemed thee out of the house of servantsima and I sent before thee one Moses two Aaron three Miriam atinami ni katum God is a god of order amen one of USI but I know it says some have advanced the thought that as we near the close of this arts history every child of God will work independently of any religious organization but I have been told that nothing of the list of such consistency shall be it will not work who are pressed together people should press together and have an organization for carrying forward God's work amen foreign uh right now we are dealing with how to organize God's work Where We Gather some one true God will leave us together we are trying to organize God's work in Nairobi we've organized God's work and I pray that also these sides and kakamega we also organize God's work Bitcoin organizations because alone we must organize God's work amen amen amen there were these three Messengers to help them to organize God's work because the three Messengers foreign foreign to help us organize God's work you see yeah and the past history of God's people those messages because all our Pioneers are together and they organize God's work in a systematic manner amen are we together so the history [Applause] the early hours the Ali are the beginnings of God's work s Alias 80 s that is our adventism and that is how Israel established Illinois says Jesus was the foundation of the Jewish economy amen yes hello yes they have to have Miriam so the first second and third Angels messages had to go before them now when adventism was being organized I'm sorry to say their foundations how the Lord and led them you see this quotation about there is nothing to fear for them for the future except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us and his teachings in our past history not not only see your village to establish the foundation of Israel The Ten Commandments the health message why don't you appoint others foreign are we together so Moses played the role Aaron played a role and Miriam also played a role in the establishment of the work and their Journey safariyao Kanan to the three Messengers foreign ERS the three messages the first second and third Angel's messages that God has given us to establish Us in the present truth 46 Exodus 24 15. to verses to The Last of Us the villain is 46. that is the same pattern when the Roman papacy was ruling 538 to 1798 the total of 60 period of Darkness spiritual Babylon that captivity foreign and then foreign that is John chapter 2 verse 19 amen yes for three days fast second and third Angels messages 1798 to 1844 46 years that is our foundation foundational truth of adventism should not be removed from those I saw somebody very high in the medical position man suggesting that the Timbers were laid longer haha Illinois says I Saw Three Steps one two three whoa and to anyone who shall remove D I saw some approaching the platform and they thought that the Timbers were later on adjusting that improvements would be made and be mentioned specifically in the same as somebody hi in the medical who was that yes the kind of crisis before I go back to AKA man so that is has has done what has sought to bring in the supposition that a great Reformation was to take place among Seventh-Day Adventists one SM two or four paragraphs and that this Reformation would consist in giving up the doctrines that stand as the pillars of our faith and engage in the process of re organization what is Reformation qualities things to take place go to the results the principles of truth that God in his wisdom has given to the remnant Church would be discarded our religion will be changed books of a new order will be a system of intellectual philosophy would be introduced a new organization would be established so clearly clear the steps that is why when Joshua Anna India because Moses did not did not participate in taking the children of Israel to Ghana's India because of the mistake and funny Moses Illinois says the Lord has showed me that the work of my husband is likened to Moses James White read the spiritual progress he was about them with the burden of the people [Music] James whites California Spalding and Madame collection you use such the work of my husband is likely to Moses James White did a lot in establishing the work at the beginning but guess what James White foreign but there were some issues which occurred later on in his ministry and that is why he used to be likened to Moses the pain of inspiration says that um stability but finally the work must progress God's people must go back you see even if Moses would strike the rock twice against God's will it does not mean that there are no faithful people still to carry forward God's word are we together yes when Illinois says let the Pioneer speak he knows she knows what she's saying because that history is very important but wait a minute Moses died the time to conquer the last enemies yes they had to be a fourth message apart from Moses hello Animalia goja to raise the fourth message to conquer now I've been interacting with many people the work of the fourth messenger first of all was to establish God's people in their Foundation experience in that's all foreign quiet look for the way marks us passing one by one look forward foreign [Music] [Music] eyes on the moon and that is what the Pioneers knew let us look at the remarks and let us be established in the truths that married as a people is let us not forget about the way much that is the autonomy chapter 31. [Music] now what your neighbor people how many years can you look at the content of their songs the contents none of them is singing our foundational truths you see the autonomy that one amen ities their song was specifically for their experience in their Journey the way the Lord had made it and his teachings in their past history that was the song God had designed the autonomy chapter number 30 [Music] verses number 19. the Bible says now therefore writing this who for you and teach it the children of Israel put it in their mouths that the soul may be a witness for me against the children of Israel I um foreign foreign [Music] corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you and evil will be for you in the latter days because he will do evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands and most respect in the ears of the congregation of Israel the words of the song until they were ended Musa foreign [Music] our foundational truth foreign they didn't understand his work we are going to conquer the last City to India they need to know the work of Nehemiah Nehemiah was given the fourth degree amen the first decree was given under King Darius the second degree to rebuild Jerusalem Babylon was given under King Cyrus Ezra 6 14. the third degree and the success the city of Jerusalem was built under three degrees to come in foreign [Music] I'm trying to bring these things to attention to establish so that when we move forward in unison in one mind Ezra chapter 6 verse 14. amen are we together the Bible says on the Elders of the Jews build it and they Prosper until one of you both through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of edothada foreign [Music] God of Israel and to the command Cyrus and Darius and after success king of pasia one tattoo okay this is the only decrease that were given and were used to complete the building no pretty hard the declare of Nehemiah the 40 degree are we together the days of the himaya and it will trouble us times [Music] the walls shall be revealed in Travelers times foreign [Music] [Music] foreign and Nairobi Tuesday to make a maternal Nairobi Town City Center Grove today we want to evangelize the cities [Music] there's no money but azima to Japan let your Travelers times we are leading our times foreign we should earnestly pray like the pioneers God will literally bring angels to provide for the means the exact money that he needed for that food so we should pray tomorrow I'm reading the statements of Illinois she says the Lord has his money in the hands of politicians Governors they have his money and if these people would approached well Karma Waters we pray and approach them is drugs so we want to establish a center of influence away from another cities we take the young people away from that place restoration and healing and we train them for the gospel Ministries God has really assisted us the correct sitting MCA or you're white so you pray with us I I don't know how I forgot that prayer request but we really want to yes just remember you pray with us also we need um thank you okay yes now you see Illinois says in the hands of politicians with Patrick and others because it 31 billion Shilling dinner to raise money for his campaigns videos [Music] we should not lack faith in these last days we should pray and act hour okay that is what we are doing this is and we explain to them the great controversy and the urgency of the work angels will come literally [Music] go to your government and very fast which might it might mean we pray first due to end God is interested in those who give their all to Father his work so we take heart and after college we just they just sit there you can share some little tips but uh be assured God has a lot of money in the hands is and it will surprise you those who shall bring in money to sustain God's work in the last days and that's what I'm working towards traveler's times the walls were being rebuilt okay Nehemiah is the fourth messenger just like Joshua and in the times of Joshua their crisis all of Israel has sinned against me they are not fit for the loud Cry of the Guardian they have seen the corporate here [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] at the second circumcision if the god of Israel is going to guide us to the final battle then we must understand him fully cowboy and the church adopted the Trinity God of Babylon watu wengi holy protest when the final Reformation of the first Angel's message is restoring back the worship of the true God God's people who are convicted in their hearts worry about what is they must accept baptism into the true worship of the Living God Joshua kasema watch anywhere foreign foreign thing for akan the son of karmi the son of zombie the son of Zera the tribe of Judah took the attached things and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel and Joshua sent men from Jericho to I ate Yeshua um which is besides but the heaven on the east side of better go up and view the country and the man went up and they returned to Joshua and said unto him let not all the people go up on let me jump to verse 5 and the man of ice molded them about 30 and six men for they chased them from before the gates foreign foreign and Joshua say the last oh Lord God wherefore verse 7. [Applause] the amorites to be destroyed by them unto God we had been content and dwell on the other side of Jordan oh Lord what shall I say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies what was the reason verse 10 the Lord said unto Joshua Yeshua get the up wherefore lies now that's upon thy face you know Israel Israel and they have also transgressed my Covenant which I commanded them for they have even taken off their casting I'm a Qatar neither will I be with you and I have also they have also stolen and dissembled also and they have put it even among their own staff you see total separation when God calls us to separate from sin and sinners he means it was do you see the formation is very great when the leaders of God's people the misery and to take even the education system of Egypt the end time reformers must restore every present Troop including education reform amen I think it scared the December church and state in our Uganda it's because of the education system of the state in the co-influenced the Roman purpose foreign they would find ways that means that is one of the reasons as to why organizations let the churches have their own School establish other churches and then sell them today what was the any idea chat School we have our church school yes we must do Reformation just bring it that is what people should understand you see akan had foreign [Music] foreign yes yes I will show the necessity of those who believe that they have the present true to be separate and distinct from those who are daily imbibing new heirs I saw that or old should attend their meetings or it was deadly and poisoned their souls that is why there is to be a total separation from Evil workers from sin from era guess what happened before I read this is yes it is under Joshua's Ministry that that that particular investigative judgment begins in the house of God every family must be investigated in the times of Joshua to fit them for the local families do you have any babylonious issues in your house what do you feel what do you watch foreign so that is why they have they have to be are an investigation of the families who profess the worship of the true God you know so only those who qualify this is we have a controversy with the leadership of admittism because they are not clear what part of Babylon is still alive they are not clear by the way are they clearly or not welcome clear no they are not clear you see Revelation 18 is a message that we should go to the world but first it must begin at home and that is what most Adventists will not accept Illinois says the work of these angels come in at the right time and joins in the voice of the third Angel to prepare God's people to start and thus God's people are prepared to stand in the hour of Temptation that is yes to come before them the work of this Angel this Angel the the message of the second Angel is repeated with the additional mention of the Corruptions that have been entering the various churches since 1844 so should we just speak of the Corruptions that were there then no we should continue with that I additional mental Corruptions infiltration additional mentions foreign foreign that was the mistake that is foreign [Music] only those who are the worshipers of the true God [Music] that is and that is why the true messages they can never be found in the leadership of all these people in this business foreign and the Catholic Bishops to bring them on board what part of Babylon is still alive is it fallen or there is some part which is still alive so the corporate Adventist is not sure whether Babylon is falling in short s [Music] to be honest and I say Ma I'm reading the last thoughts as we bring this to a close doesn't matter what God wants when I read this first in pamphlets ph081s now th is which these are publics yes yeah these are complexes zero eighty one I think it's series number eight one page that seven I read the paragraph two [Music] let me begin from paragraph one it says the early reformers amen this is a common quotation right this is the early reformers realized that they could not hope to succeed if their children were educated by the Roman Catholic teachers it requires faith and he was about to live I was also one of them are we a reformers children are being educated it's very sad the early reformers realized that they could not hope to succeed if their children were educated by the Roman Catholic teachers Luther says that the Bible must be studied teachers must be provided schools must be established he felt that to strengthen their information it was a requisite to work on the young to improve schools amen let us work on them let's put our energy our that is what we are told and to propagate through Christiano the knowledge necessary for the profound study of the Holy scriptures this accordingly was one of the objects of his life he saw it in particular at the period which we have reached and wrote the councilors of all the cities of Germany calling on them to found Christian Schools amen the early reformers found it necessary to have their own causes of study textbooks teachers methods principles Etc they separated themselves completely from the popular schools of the day it required courage and faith in those days to take such a stand and it will require even more courage and Faith for those who are preparing for translation to take the stand which the testimonies are pleading for them to take they knew that if their children should go to the schools where the popular education was given they would receive the mark of the beasts those who are leading up to the light at the present time will see even more clearly that if their children continue to go to these popular schools They will receive such principles as will compare them to assist in giving life to the image of the beasts anyone who has a knowledge of the third Angel's message and who will take the trouble to examine this and studies the methods of the popular systems of Education can see that the books are filled with those eras which will oblite those who are receiving their education from them to take the Dreadful step which will bring upon the world are religious and civil Darkness greater than has ever been known before as we continue to work on our information to establish of the present truth of the first second third Angel's message we should never forget of our children let us pray that God will open doors for us to establish our church school so that our children may be trained and taught by our own may the Lord bless us in Jesus name the way Max I don't know which number it was but five minutes look for the women's so brother it's here this idea we sing it unitedly then we'll

than us\n[994.4s] in terms of strength yeah I have to\n[998.1s] reformers they are stronger than us\n[1001.0s] okay\n[1004.8s] skills commonly wisdom\n[1008.9s] in fact the king of Babylon said go to\n[1011.7s] the Hebrews\n[1016.2s] foreign\n[1048.5s] he knows\n[1049.9s] the Bible says in verses number 10 come\n[1052.4s] on\n[1057.2s] let us deal wisely with them to attend a\n[1060.7s] quake\n[1061.9s] yes\n[1070.2s] they multiply and it came to pass that\n[1074.6s] when they are failing out any War\n[1078.3s] they join also unto our enemies and\n[1080.8s] fight against us and so

wakati\n[1118.0s] president and neutral conference\n[1120.0s] president moja police you know how many\n[1121.9s] president Macaulay\n[1130.5s] into religious councils of Kenya\n[1133.8s] akiyambia was a battle where\n[1141.7s] thank you foreign\n[1167.7s] and that is the exact thing that\n[1169.6s] happened in the times when Jesus was\n[1172.3s] being born again\n[1174.0s] same here Moses\n[1178.3s] the devil wanted to reduce the numbers\n[1180.2s] of the people\n[1181.6s] when Jesus was being born the same\n[1183.5s] scenario was happening again\n[1192.9s] so it shall be in the last days\n[1208.0s] haha\n[1209.8s] getting the point so that is where the\n[1212.3s] world is\n[1222.6s] God's people should stand on the\n[1225.5s] platform of Eternal truth you see God\n[1227.9s] will only protect his people as we do\n[1229.9s] everything in our powers\n[1231.8s] to obey every lies that God has\n[1234.6s] himself\n[1247.1s] only those who are living up to the\n[1249.5s] right they have\n[1250.7s] will receive additional light\n[1253.9s] is now\n[1263.2s] the Lord\n[1265.5s] has laid in his word\n[1268.3s] the exact part\n[1271.4s] that you would want his people to follow\n[1273.4s] the path of self-denight\n[1276.1s] the path of righteousness and holiness\n[1279.7s] and to the Lord\n[1282.6s] is misery\n[1288.3s] now wow\n[1291.1s] after the ten place\n[1305.0s] they had witnessed the power\n[1308.5s] and the Providence of God\n[1312.1s] had wrote miraculously in their behalf\n[1316.3s] Anya maku they had seen the ten plagues\n[1320.2s] fall in Egyptians\n[1326.0s] it was the greatest miracles of all\n[1328.5s] miracles\n[1330.7s] they had seen the sea coming together\n[1333.9s] and cover their enemies\n[1336.1s] what are the Miracles\n[1338.0s] what they do it\n[1341.9s] and the Bible is specific in the Book of\n[1345.0s] Micah chapter 6 verse 4 let us begin our\n[1347.4s] discourse now\n[1349.6s] Micah chapter 6\n[1352.0s] verses\n[1353.6s] number four\n[1360.0s] Micah\n[1365.7s] we are reading\n[1369.6s] some will call it Mika or Mica Micah\n[1372.6s] chapter six\n[1374.0s] amen amen\n[1382.5s] Micah

advanced\n[1437.5s] the thought\n[1438.5s] that as we near the close of this arts\n[1440.9s] history every child of God will work\n[1443.9s] independently of any religious\n[1446.3s] organization\n[1447.9s] but I have been told that nothing of the\n[1451.5s] list of such consistency shall be it\n[1454.6s] will not work\n[1456.3s] who are pressed together\n[1458.7s] people should press together and have an\n[1462.3s] organization for carrying forward God's\n[1464.7s] work amen\n[1466.1s] foreign\n[1472.1s] uh right now we are dealing with how to\n[1475.0s] organize God's work\n[1478.1s] Where We Gather some\n[1480.6s] one true God will leave us together we\n[1483.0s] are trying to organize God's work\n[1484.9s] in Nairobi we've organized God's work\n[1487.0s] and I pray that also these sides and\n[1489.3s] kakamega we also organize God's work\n[1491.9s] Bitcoin organizations because\n[1500.0s] alone\n[1505.2s] we must organize God's work amen\n[1507.9s] amen\n[1522.2s] amen there were these three Messengers\n[1524.5s] to help them to organize God's work\n[1526.9s] because the three Messengers\n[1534.6s] foreign\n[1535.8s] foreign\n[1549.3s] to help us organize God's work\n[1552.9s] you see yeah\n[1555.9s] and the past history of God's people\n[1558.8s] those messages\n[1565.7s] because all our Pioneers are together\n[1567.9s] and they organize God's work in a\n[1570.4s] systematic manner amen\n[1572.6s] are we together so the history\n[1576.1s] [Applause]\n[1581.0s] the early hours the Ali are the\n[1584.2s] beginnings of God's work\n[1587.6s] s Alias 80 s\n[1590.8s] that is our adventism\n[1593.6s] and that is how Israel established\n[1597.9s] Illinois says Jesus was the foundation\n[1601.2s] of the Jewish economy\n[1603.7s] amen yes\n[1612.2s] hello\n[1620.6s] yes they have to have Miriam\n[1624.8s] so the first second and third Angels\n[1627.9s] messages had to go before them now\n[1632.5s] when adventism was being organized I'm\n[1635.9s] sorry to say\n[1639.4s] their foundations how the Lord and led\n[1643.1s] them\n[1644.7s] you see this quotation about\n[1647.0s] there is nothing to fear for them\n[1650.4s] for the future except\n[1652.7s] as we shall forget\n[1654.9s] the way the Lord has led us and his\n[1658.7s] teachings in\n[1661.2s] our past history\n[1663.7s] not not only see your village\n[1676.6s] to establish the foundation of Israel\n[1682.6s] The Ten Commandments the\n[1687.0s] health message\n[1694.2s] why don't you appoint others foreign\n[1703.4s] are we together so Moses played the role\n[1706.7s] Aaron played a role\n[1709.1s] and Miriam also played a role in the\n[1711.5s] establishment of the work and their\n[1713.1s] Journey safariyao\n[1717.6s] Kanan\n[1726.7s] to the three Messengers\n[1730.0s] foreign\n[1739.9s] ERS the three messages\n[1742.2s] the first second and third Angel's\n[1744.1s] messages\n[1746.8s] that God has given us to establish Us in\n[1751.1s] the present truth\n[1760.0s] 46 Exodus 24 15.\n[1765.1s] to verses to The Last of Us the villain\n[1767.5s] is\n[1778.6s] 46.\n[1784.0s] that is the same pattern\n[1787.6s] when the Roman papacy was ruling 538 to\n[1791.7s] 1798 the total of 60 period of Darkness\n[1797.5s] spiritual Babylon\n[1799.9s] that captivity foreign\n[1830.4s] and then foreign\n[1844.2s] that is John chapter 2 verse 19 amen\n[1852.7s] yes\n[1856.2s] for three days fast\n[1858.8s] second and third Angels messages 1798\n[1863.8s] to 1844 46 years that is our foundation\n[1869.8s] foundational truth of adventism\n[1878.7s] should not be removed from those\n[1882.4s] I saw somebody very high in the medical\n[1887.8s] position man\n[1889.8s] suggesting that the Timbers were laid\n[1891.9s] longer\n[1892.9s] haha Illinois says I Saw Three Steps one\n[1897.6s] two three\n[1899.5s] whoa and to anyone who shall remove\n[1907.3s] D I saw some approaching the platform\n[1909.3s] and they thought that the Timbers were\n[1911.9s] later on\n[1914.0s] adjusting that improvements would be\n[1915.9s] made\n[1917.3s] and be mentioned specifically in the\n[1919.0s] same as somebody hi in the medical\n[1922.7s] who was that\n[1925.1s] yes the kind of crisis\n[1928.8s] before I go back to AKA man\n[1932.4s] so that is\n[1943.7s] has has done what\n[1946.6s] has sought to bring in the supposition\n[1948.7s] that a great Reformation was to take\n[1951.5s] place among Seventh-Day Adventists one\n[1953.9s] SM two or four paragraphs and that this\n[1957.0s] Reformation would consist in giving up\n[1959.4s] the doctrines that stand as the pillars\n[1961.9s] of our faith and engage in the process\n[1964.8s] of re\n[1965.9s] organization what is\n[1972.4s] Reformation qualities things to take\n[1975.4s] place go to the results the principles\n[1977.9s] of truth that God in his wisdom has\n[1980.1s] given to the remnant Church would be\n[1981.7s] discarded\n[1983.5s] our religion will be changed\n[1986.5s] books of a new order will be\n[1991.6s] a system of intellectual philosophy\n[1994.0s] would be introduced\n[1996.4s] a new organization\n[1999.0s] would be established\n[2001.5s] so clearly clear the steps that is why\n[2005.4s] when Joshua Anna India because Moses did\n[2009.8s] not did not participate in taking the\n[2013.0s] children of Israel to Ghana's India\n[2014.9s] because of the mistake and funny\n[2017.9s] Moses\n[2020.3s] Illinois says the Lord has showed me\n[2022.5s] that the work of my husband is likened\n[2024.6s] to Moses\n[2026.4s] James White\n[2028.3s] read the spiritual progress he was about\n[2030.3s] them with the burden of the people\n[2034.4s] [Music]\n[2038.0s] James whites California\n[2041.7s] Spalding and Madame collection you use\n[2044.0s] such the work of my husband is likely to\n[2046.9s] Moses\n[2049.6s] James White did a lot in establishing\n[2052.1s] the work at the beginning\n[2053.6s] but guess what\n[2058.6s] James White\n[2061.1s] foreign\n[2067.3s] but there were some issues which\n[2068.9s] occurred later on in his ministry\n[2071.9s] and that is why he used to be likened to\n[2073.8s] Moses\n[2075.8s] the pain of inspiration says that\n[2079.1s] um\n[2081.3s] stability\n[2086.1s] but\n[2088.2s] finally\n[2089.9s] the work must progress\n[2092.6s] God's people must go back you see even\n[2095.3s] if Moses would strike the rock twice\n[2098.4s] against God's will it does not mean that\n[2101.8s] there are no faithful people still to\n[2104.1s] carry forward God's word\n[2113.8s] are we together\n[2115.2s] yes\n[2116.6s] when Illinois says let the Pioneer speak\n[2119.1s] he knows she knows what she's saying\n[2123.4s] because that history is very important\n[2125.7s] but wait a minute\n[2128.8s] Moses died\n[2133.3s] the time to conquer the last enemies\n[2149.1s] yes they had to be a fourth message\n[2152.4s] apart from\n[2153.9s]

fourth messenger\n[2173.4s] first of all was to establish God's\n[2175.5s] people\n[2177.3s] in their Foundation\n[2179.2s] experience\n[2186.1s] in that's all\n[2189.3s] foreign\n[2217.2s]

the end time reformers must restore\n[3606.7s] every present Troop including\n[3611.6s] education reform\n[3614.5s] amen\n[3623.7s] I think it scared the December\n[3627.1s] church and state\n[3630.4s] in our Uganda\n[3634.6s] it's because of the education system of\n[3637.2s] the state\n[3639.0s] in the co-influenced the Roman purpose\n[3646.4s] foreign\n[3652.1s] they would find ways that means that is\n[3655.0s] one of the reasons as to why\n[3657.6s] organizations\n[3660.4s] let the churches have their own School\n[3670.4s] establish other churches and then sell\n[3672.7s] them today what was the any idea\n[3679.9s] chat School\n[3683.2s] we have our church school\n[3685.7s] yes\n[3687.2s] we must do Reformation\n[3695.7s] just bring it\n[3697.1s] that is what people should understand\n[3709.0s] you see akan had foreign\n[3723.3s] [Music]\n[3740.3s] foreign\n[3745.0s] yes\n[3748.4s] yes I will show the necessity of those\n[3750.2s] who believe that they have the present\n[3752.3s] true to be separate and distinct from\n[3755.1s] those who are daily imbibing new heirs\n[3760.9s] I saw that\n[3762.5s] or old should attend their meetings or\n[3766.4s] it was deadly and poisoned their souls\n[3779.9s] that is why there is to be a total\n[3783.1s] separation\n[3785.0s] from Evil workers from sin from era\n[3797.2s] guess what happened before I read this\n[3800.6s] is\n[3805.7s] yes it is under Joshua's Ministry\n[3809.7s] that that that particular investigative\n[3812.4s] judgment begins in the house of God\n[3816.6s] every family must be investigated in the\n[3820.4s] times of Joshua\n[3822.4s] to fit them for the local families\n[3830.4s] do you have any babylonious issues in\n[3833.6s] your house\n[3836.4s] what do you feel\n[3839.0s] what do you watch\n[3840.7s] foreign\n[3872.3s] so that is why they have they have to be\n[3875.2s] are\n[3876.2s] an investigation\n[3878.3s] of the families who profess the worship\n[3881.7s] of the true God\n[3883.6s] you know\n[3886.0s] so only those who qualify\n[3892.0s] this is\n[3898.6s] we have a controversy with the\n[3902.0s] leadership of admittism because they are\n[3904.7s] not clear what part of Babylon is still\n[3906.8s] alive they are not clear by the way are\n[3908.9s] they clearly or not\n[3911.3s] welcome clear\n[3913.0s] no they are not clear\n[3917.2s] you see Revelation 18 is a message that\n[3920.7s] we should go to the world but first it\n[3922.8s] must begin at home\n[3924.4s] and that is what most Adventists will\n[3926.2s] not accept\n[3928.3s] Illinois says the work of these angels\n[3931.0s] come in at the right time\n[3933.8s] and joins in the voice of the third\n[3937.7s] Angel to prepare God's people to start\n[3940.4s] and thus God's people are prepared to\n[3942.2s] stand in the hour of Temptation\n[3944.6s] that is yes to come before them\n[3950.3s] the work of this Angel this Angel the\n[3953.6s] the message of the second Angel is\n[3956.5s] repeated with\n[3958.7s] the additional mention of the\n[3962.2s] Corruptions that have been entering the\n[3964.9s] various\n[3966.6s] churches since\n[3969.0s] 1844 so\n[3974.5s] should we just speak of the Corruptions\n[3976.8s] that were there then\n[3978.4s] no we should continue with that I\n[3981.2s] additional mental\n[3984.2s] Corruptions\n[3992.8s] infiltration\n[4001.7s] additional mentions\n[4004.5s] foreign\n[4012.4s] foreign\n[4039.9s] that was the mistake\n[4042.2s] that is\n[4050.8s] foreign\n[4056.2s] [Music]\n[4065.2s] only those who are the worshipers of the\n[4067.9s] true God\n[4068.5s] [Music]\n[4075.3s] that is\n[4076.9s] and that is why the true messages\n[4080.5s] they can never be found in the\n[4082.7s] leadership of all these people in this\n[4084.2s] business\n[4085.3s] foreign\n[4114.1s] and the Catholic Bishops to bring them\n[4116.5s] on board what part of Babylon is still\n[4118.9s] alive\n[4120.0s] is it fallen or there is some part which\n[4122.7s] is still alive\n[4125.5s] so the corporate Adventist is not sure\n[4128.1s] whether Babylon is falling in short\n[4132.2s] s\n[4134.4s] [Music]\n[4148.3s] to be honest\n[4150.9s] and I say Ma\n[4155.4s] I'm reading the last\n[4158.1s] thoughts\n[4164.5s] as we bring this to a close\n[4171.8s] doesn't matter what God wants when I\n[4174.3s] read this first\n[4176.1s] in pamphlets ph081s\n[4180.9s] now th is which these are publics\n[4183.8s] yes\n[4185.2s] yeah these are complexes\n[4187.8s] zero eighty one I think it's series\n[4189.5s] number eight one page that seven\n[4191.7s] I read the paragraph two\n[4196.2s] [Music]\n[4197.4s] let me begin from paragraph one it says\n[4200.3s] the early reformers amen\n[4203.2s] this is a common quotation\n[4207.2s] right this is\n[4213.0s] the early reformers\n[4215.7s] realized\n[4219.4s] that they could not hope to succeed\n[4222.1s] if their children were educated by the\n[4224.2s] Roman Catholic teachers\n[4232.7s] it requires faith\n[4235.3s] and he was about to live\n[4238.9s] I was also one of them\n[4242.2s] are we a reformers\n[4245.3s] children are being educated\n[4249.7s] it's very sad\n[4251.4s] the early reformers realized that they\n[4254.4s] could not hope to succeed if their\n[4256.0s] children were educated by the Roman\n[4257.5s] Catholic teachers\n[4259.3s] Luther says\n[4261.1s] that the Bible must be studied teachers\n[4264.0s] must be provided schools must be\n[4266.4s] established he felt that to strengthen\n[4269.7s] their information it was a requisite to\n[4273.0s] work on the young to improve schools\n[4275.6s] amen\n[4284.6s] let us work on them\n[4287.0s] let's put our energy our\n[4289.6s] that is what we are told\n[4292.6s] and to propagate through Christiano the\n[4295.2s] knowledge necessary for the profound\n[4296.8s] study of the Holy scriptures\n[4298.9s] this accordingly was one of the objects\n[4302.1s] of his life he saw it in particular at\n[4305.2s] the period which we have reached and\n[4307.9s] wrote the councilors of all the cities\n[4309.9s] of Germany calling on them to found\n[4312.7s] Christian Schools amen the early\n[4316.6s] reformers found it necessary to have\n[4318.3s] their own causes of study textbooks\n[4321.0s] teachers methods principles Etc they\n[4325.7s] separated themselves completely from the\n[4327.9s] popular schools of the day it required\n[4330.6s] courage and faith in those days to take\n[4333.7s] such a stand and it will require even\n[4336.8s] more courage and Faith for those who are\n[4339.7s] preparing for translation to take the\n[4342.6s] stand which the testimonies are pleading\n[4345.5s] for them to take\n[4347.5s] they knew that if their children should\n[4351.3s] go to the schools where the popular\n[4353.4s] education was given they would receive\n[4355.9s] the mark of the beasts\n[4359.1s] those who are leading up to the light at\n[4361.3s] the present time will see even more\n[4363.9s] clearly that if their children continue\n[4366.0s] to go to these popular schools They will\n[4368.7s] receive such principles as will compare\n[4371.4s] them to assist in giving life to the\n[4374.1s] image of the beasts anyone who has a\n[4376.9s] knowledge of the third Angel's message\n[4378.3s] and who will take the trouble to examine\n[4380.9s] this and studies\n[4382.8s] the methods of the popular systems of\n[4385.6s] Education can see that the books are\n[4389.4s] filled with those eras which will oblite\n[4392.7s] those who are receiving their education\n[4394.9s] from them to take the Dreadful step\n[4397.9s] which will bring upon the world are\n[4400.6s] religious\n[4401.8s] and civil Darkness greater than has ever\n[4405.3s] been known before\n[4412.2s] as we continue to work on our\n[4413.8s] information to establish of the present\n[4416.3s] truth of the first second third Angel's\n[4418.0s] message we should never forget of our\n[4420.3s] children let us pray that God will open\n[4422.6s] doors for us to establish our church\n[4425.1s] school\n[4426.0s] so that our children may be trained and\n[4429.4s] taught by our own\n[4432.9s] may the Lord bless us in Jesus name\n[4443.5s] the way Max\n[4446.1s] I don't know which number it was

Satan to rule the world through the New World Order final attempt to overthrow the kingdom of God and to set up the mark of the beast the Bible says in Revelation 17: number 12 concerning the New World Order it is written and the 10 horns which thou swest are 10 Kings which have received no Kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with the Beast these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast this shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings the Bible shows the final agenda but Jesus will reign supreme many people do not understand where the world is heading Bible prophecies clear Satan had an agenda in heaven before he was thrown out of Heaven he had five strategic plans which he had suggested and the angels of heaven were deceived a third of them who fell together with him the Bible says in Isaiah chapter number 14 and vers number 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did is weaken the Nations the nations are weakened for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend unto Heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sights of the north I will Ascend above the highs of the clouds and finally he said I I will be like the most high so if the church and the Christians who are true to the Bible and the scriptures and the voice of God will be quiet then the stones will pick it up from there we have done our part the United Nations has set Vision 2030 everyone is watching some are not clear of what is going to happen the nations of the Earth are being taken captives the religious world is silent take a listen to what is happening to the nations of the earth including our own country Kenya I want you to listen to what the stones are saying these may not be necessarily Christians but these are faithful citizens of this country listen to what they saying and then we'll come back fellow Kenyans uh Steve mooa now basically I just wanted to touch on few issues uh um I'm one person who believes that you can never find a solution to any problem you're going through as a country if you don't understand the root cause of these problems now you'll agree with me that uh the entire country is in shambles in terms of people's emotions and uh the feelings you know people feel betrayed people feel uh the cost of living is gone up you know they were promised so much and they're not getting anything and it's it's very important for Kenyans to understand what is really happening in this country uh without doubt and fear of contradiction I'll tell you that the entire Kenyan systems from the political to the economic I'll say even probably the social uh systems have been taken over by the globalists today as we speak the globalists control our entire political system policy systems and the economic systems when I talk of the globalist I'm talking of the IMF I'm talking of the World Bank I'm talking of the world economic forum and we have to understand what these people are and what their intentions are in the long run now I'll take you briefly uh towards the history so that you understand where I'm coming from remember all these people work through serious organizations like the United Nations the United Nations was created immediately after the second world war that was in 1946 in the 13th of February 1946 the United Nations formulated a document called the United Nations Charter in the charter it states clearly that its key objective is to break down the sovereign ities of countries and create a one world government that is very clear and as I've said I'm not here to propagate anything this is information that is out there go to the net go to the web look for the United Nation chter and you'll find this information it states it's it states down everything all the regulations all all all all all all the advantages that the UN will have which is their agenda now during the that time with this big agenda and remember even before the second world war the great leaders for example the likes of uh the likes of Hitler the likes of Stalin they all had the similar objective of controlling the whole world but they failed because with them they resulted to using Force which didn't work now after the formulation of the UN these organizations were were run by a group of cabals or bosses or globalists known as the build thebad Group which later on changed its name in 1971 to the world economic Forum now led by a German Economist called Cloud show up later on during this period the world was experiencing what to call the Cold War so immediately the Cold War ended in 1991 the club of Rome started accelerating this idea of the new world order or the world world uh One World Government remember it is even evident they did a book there's a book called the first Global Revolution if you have time go online look for that book read that book that book States clearly that the biggest enemy of the world is Humanity itself in 1992 more than 166 country countries met under the UN and signed and agreed that the biggest problem the world is experiencing is overpopulation and that they should create and formulate ways on how to depopulate the world and I'm telling you Kenyans this is information that is out there you can go out there research read and get to understand the acceleration started and they formulated a document under the world economic Forum if you read if you go and read about the world economic Forum this is an umbrella of the globalist the rich people of the world they meet in a place called Davos every year in Switzerland and they decide the way forward you know this year we'll invest in this we'll put these laws we'll put this formulate this policies in these countries and so forth create this and create that destabilize this and stabilize that that is they they they they are in quotes the bosses of the world to me I believe you're all equal but that's their mentality which they have a right to believe the what whatever they believe in their strategy of depopulation and control in order to create the One World Government they picked on few issues to tackle number one the basic thing to do to control Mankind and also to depopulate mankind is control the food you control the food you control Humanity so they've been putting in place enforcing leaders whom they control in all these countries to create policies that at the end of the day will frustrate the citizens will create food shortages and will end up creating hunger starvation hence depopulation will be there either in the form of malnutrition or lack of food and these things are coming I'm not joking you want to take it for granted it's up to you since no leader is talking about this since no leader understands what's going on I have taken this mantle to talk to Kenyans so that let us discuss the real issues let us discuss what is ailing this country if we can solve that problem I'm telling you our problem is not money our problem is not economy those are things we can solve we've done it before kibaki did it before without help from anyone we have best brains in this country but we have to understand that our president has been held captive and it did not start with Ruto if you look at all these policies all these policies the implementations started during uru time I was in odm I was an neck member and I'll tell you 101% and any neck member including R oinga himself will confirm I am the only person who left and told them there's a game being played and I guaranteed and even if you go to our walls before they remove me from the group go to the walls of the neck my last message was we will go to elections in the next two years and uru will never take Raa to gay live alone Mount Kenya as much as uru does not like rut he had no option these were conditions given to him and they knew they cannot control R odinga that's why he had to pass the mantle to Ruto let no one lie to you they might have their own personal differences they don't like each other but they they all are were and are controlled by the same system that that one you can take it to the bank now I'll speak of the few things that we've seen in this country that are being formulated after told you the New World Order agenda aims to control the whole world by creating a One World Government when I talk of a One World Government I'm talking of one government one president one Army one Judicial System you know and it trickles down for them to do that they came with a formulation document number one control the food number two identity and that's when they came with the new idea of the digital identity through the help of it so that they can be able to control and know each and every movement of each and every person on Earth these things are real these things are coming now let me let let me touch on let me touch on food how how how how are they going to do it it's through formulation of policies they came up with the agenda of climate change what does climate change has to do with agriculture number one with the climate change formulation policy it says agriculture in itself is what is creating the changes in climate number one they're bringing in restrictions on nitrogen fertilizers number two we have seen in Kenya here even from kinu time when he formulated what we call the strategy document when he was the minister today it is illegal to share seeds so even organic seeds if I'm to give my neighbor for him to plant in his 100 acres it is illegal we created policies to allow foreign companies to come and patent their seeds here which you're not supposed to buy from anyone else apart from them and Mark you majority of these seeds are genetically modified seeds which number one are very expensive to buy Al there you go on Google Kenyans just check the price of tomato seeds GMO tomato seeds the cheapest you'll get is about 10 million Shillings per kilo the best quality is about 50 60 million Shillings a kilo of tomato seeds so what does that mean if you're forcing me to buy these seeds as a normal farmer and I can't afford 10 million what what is the next thing I'll do I'll abandon farming and that's what is happening they brought in laws on on on uh potato Farmers they brought in funny funny laws on farming just to break down the farmers and ensure you're no longer in the industry same as livestock farming what does the climate change policy say on climate far uh livestock farming it says livestock farming releases um greenhouse gases which release nitrogen in the air hence affect the climate so they're saying now you have to register if you have cows if you have cattle if you have poultry and if you don't there are Hefty fines up to millions of shillings to scare you all these things are done by Design because they want to control the food remember I have told you in the world economic Forum in the New World Order agenda they St very well that the idea is no one should own anything the entire land the entire farming should be owned by the corporations so my friend when you're busy talking about this housing project housing project the housing projects is a must for rut to do them because he's been told he must do them simply because in the two next few years there's no farmer who will be able to farm in this country and the next thing they'll do they'll give you offers they'll offer you money for your farm once you hand over your farm they'll give you an offer they'll tell you by the way we have an apartment which you can get at a better price you've heard words even from the president himself where he says I think it is time people should leave rural areas and come to urban areas we need to free up space for farming free up space for farming you know some words like building back better you know building back better go on YouTube just type build back better go on Twitter build back better you'll see the people who mention that word and what they say they're all aligned to this agenda they call them sustainable development goals it's not sustainable my friend all they want is total control I will tell you as a Kenyan as a patriot someone who cannot be bought and it's sad no leader is seeing the angle in which this thing is being uh directed so my friends stop asking about the housing projects and all that all those houses are meant for all those who will lose their land that's why there's no structure that's why even the mes that's why even the the Attorney General comes and says he knew nothing about this housing thing you know because it is above his level it is being done by the cabals and it is through policies MPS please I know how they control you but please before you amend and pass these bills read them read them when you go to the United Nations Charter most of the countries in the world have even signed that they're going to surrender 30% of the land to the UN for the purpose of Conservancy to preserve climate today in Kenya laws are coming you know read laws are coming to give the Government powers for compulsory acquisition of land you know they come to kitui and say now the entire kitu we need to do some Conservancy here so you people have to leave compulsory acquisition and you're offering 10 Shillings per acre or 10 million per acre or 1 million or or or or three you know it's government my friend so these things are there and it's the UN saying it they're giving them the the way forward the the path is being created by them now once you control the food it means hunger will come people will be frustrated you've controlled the food number two control their economy frustrate them economically look at this country for the last 10 years when did you hear when did you last hear of a success story there's a businessman who started a business and is doing well you can't do well because the system have been made to break us completely who formulated the law that you can't withdraw 1 million or or deposit more than 1 million Shillings when Ruto was campaigning he said he will make sure he opens up that LW why has it not changed why is it the one who was in charge of Treasury during uhuru's time and the one who was in charge of of of of Central Bank why is it the same people who we sa and cast them that they've brought down our economy why is it that when Ruto came in they didn't bring in new people they just SWA them to went the other side and Jog went to the other side there only two reasons why you'll do that number one it's either to control information or number two to continue doing what they were doing which we I you and I know is breaking the system number three now once you create all these people die of stress you know many people look at look at the the the mental cases going on in the country look at look at the diseases look look at the pressure people are going through economically people are frustrated people are you know it's like people are going crazy now you cannot even Farm there's no food there's nothing what next now that we we've started dealing with the numbers we now need to control them how do we control them we control them through the digital ID remember very soon this entire economic system the dollar system the world Reserve System is going to collapse there's going to be an introduction of the new cbdc they called the Central Bank digital currencies we are all going digital it's like the Bitcoins you know and the digital currency will be attached to your digital identity so my friend you break the rules like you say things against the government for example what I'm saying you can't use your digital currency anywhere you go to a shop to buy skuma you're told so you understand what I mean you know you can't travel you can't move you're told you can't leave Nairobi out of Nairobi my friend your your digital currency cannot work so you cannot survive so those are the things that are coming and how will they do it it's very simple how do you do it you create chaos how do you create chaos to make people adapt the the digital ID because some countries people will Rebel so what do you do open the borders free Visa open the borders because you know the moment I open the Border all that will come in in an expectation in a year or so chaos will erupt then the government now will come as a Good Samaritan and tell you oh please uh because there's so much crime in this country we now need compulsory acquisition of digital IDs to everyone so that we can know each and everyone and my friends you will get that digital ID and once you get that digital ID you are in jail slavery is coming back and this is real I'm saying it from the bottom of my heart and I'm saying I'm not propagating anything this is is information that is out there go read about the Davos agenda go read about the world economic Forum go read about the New World Order go read about the UN Charter and you'll understand where we are heading to that is what is happening my friends that is what is happening not once not twice not Thrice your president himself he's told even his leaders I watched when they had the the PG at state house he said my hands are tied now he's the senior most civil servant in the country he's the boss who else can tie his hand and he's the boss of all bosses in this country it is the globalists and they've taken over and I think he needs help I think he needs help you know we should not just we should not just uh Ambush him I think that man is suffering and he needs help because it's a point of no return today you've seen yesterday they were in Uganda R is opting out and remember the last one of the last interviews Raa did he said I've realized it's not true to who stole my elections my elections were stolen by some people who have interests now it's me telling you because they're always scared to say they're always scared to mention those names because the few leaders who mentioned you know you know you know the story of our neighboring presidents who died finally you know you go yeah we know them you know them you go against them they they deal with you anyway people like us personally I'm not scared of anything the worst thing in life is there's there's one old man who told me the richest place on Earth is the grave because beneath the grave lies so many ideas lies so many eye openers that did not utilize the time when they were alive so I decide to use this time just to talk to to my fellow Kenyans the worst thing is when our kids will grow up and find such we live a beautiful country like this where our forefathers died poured blood for us to have this slavery this beautiful country and we leaving it to the dogs you know it's it's so sad you know when our kids will be asking us daddy mommy where were you when all this was happening we have to start speaking now the media focus on the right issues the media don't be scared what we are saying is let us talk about the fundamental let's Cascade down to the roots and know the real causes of our problems and that's when we'll find a solution the few leaders who've been there and been been trying I want to to to to appla one ok omata but you seem not to to recognize him you know because he's a nobody we are meant to believe that in opposition it is so and so he supposed to talk and so and so he supposed to talk my friend hey every Kenyan has something to say even a beggar on the road can save your life information is power and knowledge is king So Kenyans I urge you and the media from today start researching start reading about all these agenda the New World Order agenda the agenda 2030 the world economic Forum read about the UN Charter read about the globalist agenda and you'll understand what is happening in Kenya it's the same thing that has been happening all over today for the whole of last two weeks you've seen farmers in Germany in Spain in Holland they were all demonstrating why were they demonstrating because of similar policies land is being taken from them now it's being owned by the globalists they said policies where they snatch the land from them and that is what is coming in this country it is coming so are you ready the question is are you ready anyway if there's any leader any person who disputes what I'm saying I'm ready call me for an interview anywhere CNN BBC Al jaaz K call me one onone two on two even the president himself I'm ready to sit with you challenge me I challenge you I'm doing this for Kenya Kenya is my business and my business is Kenya thank you Kenyans Kaz",

the\n[11.7s] scriptures the final agenda of Satan to\n[14.8s] rule the world through the New World\n[17.0s] Order final attempt to overthrow the\n[19.4s] kingdom of God and to set up the mark of\n[22.2s] the beast the Bible says in Revelation\n[25.1s] 17: number\n[27.0s] 12 concerning the New World Order it is\n[30.4s] written and the 10 horns which thou\n[32.8s] swest are 10 Kings which have received\n[36.1s] no Kingdom as yet but receive power as\n[40.8s] kings one hour with the\n[43.4s] Beast these have one mind and shall give\n[46.6s] their power and strength unto the\n[50.7s] Beast this shall make war with the lamb\n[53.4s] and the lamb shall overcome them for he\n[55.4s] is Lord of lords and King of Kings the\n[58.0s] Bible shows the final agenda\n[61.0s] but Jesus will reign\n[63.9s] supreme many people do not understand\n[66.8s] where the world is heading Bible\n[68.5s] prophecies clear Satan had an agenda in\n[71.3s] heaven before he was thrown out of\n[75.2s] Heaven he had five strategic\n[78.3s] plans which he had suggested and the\n[81.1s] angels of heaven were deceived a third\n[83.2s] of them who fell together with him the\n[87.4s] Bible says in Isaiah chapter number 14\n[89.7s] and vers number 12 how art thou fallen\n[93.1s] from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the\n[95.0s] morning how art thou cut down to the\n[97.7s] ground which did is weaken the Nations\n[100.2s] the nations are\n[101.7s] weakened for thou Hast said in thine\n[104.1s] heart I will Ascend unto Heaven I will\n[107.7s] exalt my throne above the stars of God I\n[111.0s] will sit upon the Mount of the\n[112.7s] congregation in the sights of the north\n[115.2s] I will Ascend above the highs of the\n[117.5s] clouds and finally he said I I will be\n[121.1s] like the most\n[122.8s] high\n[124.4s] so if the church and the Christians who\n[127.6s] are true to the Bible and the scriptures\n[129.8s] and the voice of God will be quiet then\n[132.9s] the stones will pick it up from there we\n[135.7s] have done our part the United Nations\n[138.6s] has set Vision 2030 everyone is watching\n[142.7s] some are not clear of what is going to\n[145.0s] happen the nations of the Earth are\n[146.7s] being taken captives the religious world\n[149.2s] is silent\n[150.7s] take a listen to what is happening to\n[152.5s] the nations of the earth including our\n[154.7s] own country Kenya I want you to listen\n[157.1s] to what the stones are saying these may\n[159.3s] not be necessarily Christians but these\n[161.7s] are faithful citizens of this country\n[164.2s] listen to what they saying and then\n[166.2s] we'll come\n[169.5s] back fellow\n[172.6s] Kenyans uh Steve\n[175.9s] mooa now basically I just wanted to\n[178.2s] touch on few issues uh um I'm one person\n[181.7s] who believes\n[183.1s] that you can never find a solution to\n[186.2s] any problem you're going through as a\n[187.7s] country if you don't\n[190.2s] understand the root cause of these\n[193.0s] problems now you'll agree with me that\n[196.0s] uh the entire\n[199.4s] country is in shambles in terms of\n[203.2s] people's emotions and uh the feelings\n[206.6s] you know people feel betrayed people\n[208.6s] feel uh the cost of living is gone up\n[212.0s] you know they were promised so much and\n[213.6s] they're not getting anything and it's\n[216.3s] it's very important for Kenyans to\n[218.4s] understand what is really happening in\n[219.8s] this\n[220.8s] country uh without doubt and fear of\n[224.4s] contradiction I'll tell you that the\n[226.5s] entire Kenyan systems from the political\n[229.4s] to the economic I'll say even probably\n[231.9s] the\n[232.7s] social uh systems have been taken over\n[236.1s] by the globalists today as we speak\n[240.2s] the globalists control our entire\n[242.6s] political system policy systems and the\n[245.9s] economic systems when I talk of the\n[247.8s] globalist I'm talking of the IMF I'm\n[249.4s] talking of the World Bank I'm talking of\n[250.8s] the world economic forum and we have to\n[253.9s] understand what these people are and\n[257.5s] what their intentions are in the long\n[259.9s] run now I'll take you\n[263.2s] briefly uh towards the history so that\n[266.3s] you understand where I'm coming from\n[269.0s] remember\n[270.4s] all these people work through serious\n[273.2s] organizations like the United Nations\n[275.9s] the United Nations was created\n[280.4s] immediately after the second world war\n[282.2s] that was in 1946 in the 13th of February\n[285.8s] 1946 the United Nations formulated a\n[289.7s] document called the United Nations\n[291.6s] Charter in the charter it states clearly\n[294.8s] that its key\n[296.5s] objective is to break down the sovereign\n[299.7s] ities of countries and create a one\n[302.6s] world government that is very clear and\n[305.3s] as I've said I'm not here to propagate\n[307.1s] anything this is information that is out\n[309.7s] there go to the net go to the web look\n[312.7s] for the United Nation chter and you'll\n[314.9s] find this information it states it's it\n[318.1s] states down everything all the\n[320.2s] regulations all all all all all all the\n[324.2s] advantages that the UN will have which\n[326.9s] is their agenda now during the that time\n[331.1s] with this big agenda and remember even\n[333.4s] before the second world war the great\n[335.1s] leaders for example the likes of uh the\n[339.2s] likes of Hitler the likes of Stalin they\n[342.5s] all had the similar objective of\n[345.9s] controlling the whole world but they\n[347.8s] failed because with them they resulted\n[350.7s] to using Force which didn't\n[353.2s] work now after the formulation of the\n[356.4s] UN these\n[358.4s] organizations were were run by a group\n[361.0s] of cabals or bosses or globalists known\n[365.7s] as the build thebad Group which later on\n[369.1s] changed its name in 1971 to the world\n[372.5s] economic Forum now led by a German\n[374.8s] Economist called Cloud show\n[377.8s] up later on during this period the world\n[382.0s] was experiencing what to call the Cold\n[383.6s] War so immediately the Cold War ended in\n[387.8s] 1991 the club of Rome\n[390.8s] started\n[392.9s] accelerating this idea of the new world\n[395.4s] order or the world world uh One World\n[399.0s] Government remember it is even evident\n[402.7s] they did a book there's a book called\n[405.4s] the\n[406.7s] first Global Revolution if you have time\n[410.8s] go online look for that book read that\n[412.7s] book that book States clearly that the\n[414.6s] biggest enemy of the world is Humanity\n[418.3s] itself in 1992 more than 166 country\n[423.0s] countries met under the UN and signed\n[426.8s] and agreed that the biggest problem the\n[428.8s] world is experiencing is overpopulation\n[431.6s] and that they should create and\n[433.8s] formulate ways on how to depopulate the\n[438.6s] world and I'm telling you Kenyans this\n[441.0s] is information that is out there you can\n[442.6s] go out there research read and get to\n[448.3s] understand the acceleration started and\n[452.0s] they formulated a document under the\n[454.8s] world economic Forum if you read if you\n[456.8s] go and read about the world economic\n[458.3s] Forum this is an umbrella of the\n[459.6s] globalist the rich people of the world\n[461.5s] they meet in a place called Davos every\n[463.4s] year in Switzerland and they decide the\n[466.5s] way forward you know this year we'll\n[468.6s] invest in this we'll put these laws\n[470.5s] we'll put this formulate this policies\n[472.6s] in these countries and so forth create\n[474.9s] this and create that destabilize this\n[476.5s] and stabilize that that is they they\n[480.0s] they they are in quotes the bosses of\n[482.7s] the world to me I believe you're all\n[484.4s] equal but that's their mentality which\n[487.0s] they have a right to believe the what\n[488.6s] whatever they\n[490.8s] believe in their strategy of\n[494.5s] depopulation and\n[498.0s] control in order to create the One World\n[501.7s] Government they picked on few issues to\n[505.6s] tackle number one the basic thing to do\n[508.8s] to control Mankind and also to\n[511.9s] depopulate mankind is control the food\n[514.4s] you control the food you\n[516.6s] control\n[518.8s] Humanity so they've been putting in\n[522.4s] place enforcing leaders whom they\n[525.6s] control in all these\n[527.3s] countries to create policies that at the\n[530.6s] end of the\n[532.7s] day will frustrate the citizens will\n[535.9s] create food shortages and will end up\n[539.6s] creating hunger starvation hence\n[542.6s] depopulation will be there either in the\n[545.0s] form of malnutrition or lack of food and\n[547.6s] these things are coming I'm not joking\n[549.4s] you want to take it for granted it's up\n[550.9s] to you since no leader is talking about\n[553.1s] this since no leader understands what's\n[555.6s] going on I have taken this mantle to\n[557.7s] talk to Kenyans so that let us discuss\n[560.0s] the real issues let us discuss what is\n[562.2s] ailing this country if we can solve that\n[565.0s] problem I'm telling you our problem is\n[566.6s] not money our problem is not economy\n[569.4s] those are things we can solve we've done\n[571.6s] it before kibaki did it\n[573.8s] before without help from anyone we have\n[577.2s] best brains in this country but we have\n[579.8s] to understand that our president has\n[581.5s] been held captive and it did not start\n[584.4s] with\n[585.5s] Ruto if you look at all these\n[589.1s] policies all these policies the\n[591.5s] implementations started during uru\n[595.6s] time I was in odm I was an neck member\n[598.8s] and I'll tell you\n[600.5s] 101% and any neck member including R\n[603.6s] oinga himself will\n[605.1s] confirm I am the only person who left\n[608.5s] and told them there's a game being\n[610.9s] played and I guaranteed and even if you\n[613.8s] go to our walls before they remove me\n[615.6s] from the group go to the walls of the\n[617.6s] neck my last message was we will go to\n[620.9s] elections in the next two years and uru\n[623.1s] will never take Raa to gay live alone\n[626.1s] Mount Kenya as much as uru does not like\n[629.0s] rut he had no option these were\n[632.0s] conditions given to him and they knew\n[634.4s] they cannot control R odinga that's why\n[637.4s] he had to pass the mantle to Ruto let no\n[640.0s] one lie to you they might have their own\n[641.9s] personal differences they don't like\n[643.6s] each other but they they\n[647.4s] all are were and are controlled by the\n[650.8s] same system that that one you can take\n[653.1s] it to the bank now I'll speak of the few\n[655.6s] things that we've seen in this country\n[657.4s] that are being formulated after told you\n[660.9s] the New World Order agenda aims to\n[664.6s] control the whole world by creating a\n[667.8s] One World Government when I talk of a\n[669.4s] One World Government I'm talking of one\n[671.5s] government one president one Army one\n[674.4s] Judicial System you know and it trickles\n[679.4s] down for them to do that they came with\n[682.2s] a formulation document number one\n[683.9s] control the food number\n[687.1s] two identity\n[689.9s] and that's when they came with the new\n[691.9s] idea of the digital identity through the\n[694.2s] help of it so that they can be able to\n[697.1s] control and know each and every movement\n[700.4s] of each and every person on Earth these\n[703.4s] things are real these things are coming\n[705.6s] now let me let let me touch on let me\n[707.9s] touch on\n[709.5s] food how how how how are they going to\n[712.1s] do it it's through formulation of\n[714.4s] policies they came up with the agenda of\n[716.7s] climate change what does climate change\n[720.2s] has to do with agriculture number one\n[722.8s] with the climate change formulation\n[724.7s] policy it says agriculture in itself is\n[728.5s] what is creating the changes in\n[731.7s] climate number one they're bringing in\n[734.8s] restrictions on nitrogen fertilizers\n[737.7s] number two we have seen in Kenya\n[741.4s] here even from kinu time when he\n[744.4s] formulated what we call the strategy\n[746.1s] document when he was the minister today\n[749.4s] it is illegal to share seeds so even\n[752.3s] organic seeds if I'm to give my neighbor\n[754.2s] for him to plant in his 100 acres it is\n[756.3s] illegal we created policies to allow\n[759.4s] foreign companies to come and patent\n[761.3s] their seeds here which you're not\n[763.7s] supposed to buy from anyone else apart\n[765.5s] from them and Mark you majority of these\n[768.3s] seeds are genetically modified seeds\n[770.9s] which number one are very expensive to\n[773.1s] buy Al there you go on Google Kenyans\n[776.5s] just check the price of tomato seeds GMO\n[780.1s] tomato seeds the cheapest you'll get is\n[782.2s] about 10 million Shillings per\n[784.9s] kilo the best quality is about 50 60\n[787.6s] million Shillings a kilo of tomato seeds\n[789.9s] so what does that mean if you're forcing\n[791.9s] me to buy these seeds as a normal farmer\n[794.3s] and I can't afford 10 million what what\n[796.5s] is the next thing I'll do I'll abandon\n[798.3s] farming and that's what is happening\n[800.4s] they brought in laws on on on uh potato\n[803.7s] Farmers they brought in funny funny laws\n[807.0s] on farming just to break down the\n[809.9s] farmers and ensure you're no longer in\n[812.1s] the industry same as livestock farming\n[814.3s] what does the climate change policy say\n[815.8s] on climate far uh livestock farming it\n[818.0s] says livestock farming\n[820.2s] releases um greenhouse gases which\n[824.5s] release nitrogen in the air hence affect\n[827.4s] the climate so they're saying now you\n[829.9s] have to register if you have cows if you\n[831.6s] have cattle if you have poultry and if\n[833.6s] you don't there are Hefty fines up to\n[835.4s] millions of shillings to scare you all\n[838.2s] these things are done by Design because\n[840.2s] they want to control the food remember I\n[842.2s] have told you in the world economic\n[844.3s] Forum in the New World Order agenda they\n[846.9s] St very well that the idea is no one\n[850.9s] should own anything the entire land the\n[854.0s] entire farming should be owned by the\n[857.7s] corporations so my friend when you're\n[860.6s] busy talking about this housing project\n[862.2s] housing project the housing projects is\n[866.0s] a must for rut to do them because he's\n[867.9s] been told he must do them simply because\n[871.0s] in the two next few years there's no\n[873.4s] farmer who will be able to farm in this\n[874.9s] country and the next thing they'll do\n[877.0s] they'll give you offers they'll offer\n[878.4s] you money for your farm once you hand\n[881.2s] over your\n[882.3s] farm they'll give you an offer they'll\n[884.3s] tell you by the way we have an apartment\n[886.2s] which you can get at a better price\n[888.1s] you've heard words even from the\n[890.0s] president himself where he says I think\n[891.9s] it is time people should leave rural\n[893.4s] areas and come to urban areas we need to\n[895.5s] free up space for farming free up space\n[897.7s] for farming you know some words like\n[899.7s] building back better you know building\n[901.7s] back better go on YouTube just type\n[904.2s] build back better go on Twitter build\n[906.6s] back better you'll see the people who\n[908.2s] mention that word and what they say\n[910.2s] they're all aligned to this agenda they\n[912.7s] call them sustainable development goals\n[914.9s] it's not sustainable my friend all they\n[916.6s] want is total control I will tell you as\n[918.9s] a Kenyan as a patriot someone who cannot\n[920.6s] be bought and it's sad no leader is\n[923.3s] seeing the angle in which this thing is\n[926.0s] being uh directed so my friends stop\n[929.6s] asking about the housing projects and\n[931.5s] all that all those houses are meant for\n[933.0s] all those who will lose their land\n[934.7s] that's why there's no structure that's\n[936.3s] why even the mes that's why even the the\n[938.6s] Attorney General comes and says he knew\n[940.5s] nothing about this housing thing you\n[942.3s] know because it is above his level it is\n[945.2s] being done by the cabals and it is\n[947.9s] through policies MPS please I know how\n[951.4s] they control you but please before you\n[953.8s] amend and pass these bills read them\n[957.2s] read them when you go to the United\n[959.9s] Nations\n[961.0s] Charter most of the countries in the\n[963.0s] world have even signed that they're\n[965.5s] going to surrender 30% of the\n[969.1s] land to the UN for the purpose of\n[971.6s] Conservancy to preserve\n[974.8s] climate today in Kenya laws are coming\n[978.9s] you know read laws are coming to give\n[981.9s] the Government powers for compulsory\n[984.1s] acquisition of land you know they come\n[986.4s] to kitui and say now the entire kitu we\n[989.2s] need to do some Conservancy here so you\n[992.8s] people have to leave compulsory\n[994.8s] acquisition and you're offering 10\n[996.6s] Shillings per acre or 10 million per\n[998.6s] acre or 1 million or or or or three you\n[1001.9s] know it's government my friend so these\n[1004.2s] things are there and it's the UN saying\n[1005.8s] it they're giving them the the way\n[1008.2s] forward the the path is being created by\n[1012.2s] them\n[1013.8s] now once you control the food it means\n[1018.2s] hunger will come\n[1019.4s] people will be frustrated you've\n[1021.0s] controlled the food number two control\n[1024.2s] their economy frustrate them\n[1026.2s] economically look at this country for\n[1028.2s] the last 10 years when did you hear when\n[1031.2s] did you last hear of a success story\n[1033.1s] there's a businessman who started a\n[1034.4s] business and is doing well you can't do\n[1037.2s] well because the system have been made\n[1040.0s] to break us\n[1043.6s] completely who formulated the law that\n[1046.2s] you can't withdraw 1 million or or\n[1048.3s] deposit more than 1 million\n[1050.6s] Shillings when Ruto was campaigning he\n[1053.5s] said he will make sure he opens up that\n[1055.5s] LW why has it not\n[1057.1s] changed why is\n[1059.5s] it the one who was in charge of Treasury\n[1062.5s] during uhuru's time and the one who was\n[1065.1s] in charge of of of of Central\n[1068.5s] Bank why is it the same people who we sa\n[1072.4s] and cast them that they've brought down\n[1074.5s] our economy why is it that when Ruto\n[1076.8s] came in they didn't bring in new people\n[1078.6s] they just SWA them to went the other\n[1080.6s] side and Jog went to the other side\n[1083.1s] there only two reasons why you'll do\n[1084.7s] that number one it's either to control\n[1087.2s] information or number two to continue\n[1089.6s] doing what they were doing which we I\n[1092.2s] you and I know is breaking the\n[1096.8s] system number\n[1098.7s] three now once you create all these\n[1101.7s] people die of stress you know many\n[1103.4s] people look at look at the the the\n[1105.2s] mental cases going on in the country\n[1107.2s] look at look at the diseases look look\n[1108.9s] at the pressure people are going through\n[1110.8s]

Rebel so what do\n[1191.2s] you do open the borders free\n[1194.3s] Visa open the borders because you know\n[1196.8s] the moment I open the Border all that\n[1199.2s] will come\n[1200.8s] in in an expectation in a year or so\n[1204.2s] chaos will erupt then the government now\n[1207.2s] will come as a Good Samaritan and tell\n[1208.8s] you oh please uh because there's so much\n[1211.5s] crime in this country we now need\n[1214.7s] compulsory acquisition of digital IDs to\n[1218.1s] everyone so that we can know each and\n[1220.4s] everyone and my friends you will get\n[1222.4s] that digital

propagating anything this\n[1232.7s] is is information that is out there go\n[1235.0s] read about the Davos agenda go read\n[1237.0s] about the world economic Forum go read\n[1238.9s] about the New World Order go read about\n[1240.8s] the UN Charter and you'll understand\n[1242.6s] where we are heading\n[1245.9s] to that is what is happening my\n[1249.0s] friends that is what is\n[1252.0s] happening not once not twice not Thrice\n[1254.7s] your president himself he's told even\n[1256.6s] his leaders I watched when they had the\n[1258.6s] the PG at state house he said my hands\n[1261.8s] are\n[1262.6s] tied now he's the senior most civil\n[1265.2s] servant in the country he's the boss who\n[1267.8s] else can tie his\n[1270.4s] hand and he's the boss of all bosses in\n[1273.4s] this country it is the globalists and\n[1276.2s] they've taken over and I think he needs\n[1278.9s] help I think he needs help you know we\n[1281.8s] should not just we should not just uh\n[1284.8s] Ambush him I think that man is suffering\n[1287.7s] and he needs help\n[1289.5s] because it's a point of no return today\n[1291.7s] you've seen yesterday they were in\n[1293.3s] Uganda R is opting out and remember the\n[1298.1s] last one of the last interviews Raa did\n[1300.2s] he said I've realized it's not true to\n[1302.0s] who stole my elections my elections were\n[1304.1s] stolen by some people who have interests\n[1305.9s] now it's me telling you because they're\n[1307.4s] always scared to say they're always\n[1310.0s] scared to mention those names because\n[1311.9s] the few leaders who mentioned you know\n[1313.7s] you know you know the story of our\n[1315.3s] neighboring presidents who died finally\n[1317.6s] you know you go yeah we know them you\n[1319.4s] know them you go against them they they\n[1321.8s] deal with you\n[1324.2s] anyway people like us personally I'm not\n[1326.6s] scared of anything the worst thing in\n[1329.1s] life is there's there's one old man who\n[1331.5s] told me the richest place on Earth is\n[1333.6s] the grave because beneath the grave lies\n[1336.8s] so many ideas lies so many eye openers\n[1340.0s] that did not utilize the time when they\n[1343.3s] were\n[1344.2s] alive so I decide to use this time just\n[1348.1s] to talk to to my fellow Kenyans the\n[1350.2s] worst thing is when our kids will grow\n[1352.8s] up and find such we live a beautiful\n[1356.9s] country like this where our forefathers\n[1358.7s] died poured blood for us to have this\n[1361.1s] slavery this beautiful country and we\n[1363.4s] leaving it to the dogs you know it's\n[1365.2s] it's so sad you know when our kids will\n[1366.9s] be asking us daddy mommy where were you\n[1368.8s] when all this was happening we have to\n[1370.6s] start speaking now the media focus on\n[1373.1s] the right issues the media don't be\n[1375.9s] scared what we are saying is let us talk\n[1380.0s] about the fundamental let's Cascade down\n[1382.2s] to the roots and know the real causes of\n[1385.3s] our problems and that's when we'll find\n[1387.6s] a\n[1390.0s] solution the few leaders who've been\n[1392.2s] there and been been trying I want to to\n[1394.9s] to to appla one ok\n[1397.1s] omata but you seem not to to recognize\n[1400.2s] him you know because he's a nobody we\n[1401.8s] are meant to believe that in opposition\n[1403.7s] it is so and so he supposed to talk and\n[1405.8s] so and so he supposed to talk my friend\n[1408.3s] hey every Kenyan has something to say\n[1410.4s] even a beggar on the road can save your\n[1412.9s] life information is power and knowledge\n[1415.3s] is\n[1416.0s] king So Kenyans I urge you and the media\n[1420.0s] from today start researching start\n[1423.2s] reading about all these agenda the New\n[1425.4s] World Order agenda the agenda 2030 the\n[1428.0s] world economic Forum read about the UN\n[1430.4s] Charter read about the globalist agenda\n[1434.4s] and you'll understand what is happening\n[1436.0s] in Kenya it's the same thing that has\n[1437.8s] been happening\n[1439.0s] all over today for the whole of last two\n[1441.8s] weeks you've seen farmers in Germany in\n[1444.0s] Spain in Holland they were all\n[1446.2s] demonstrating why were they\n[1447.6s] demonstrating because of similar\n[1449.6s] policies land is being taken from them\n[1452.0s] now it's being owned by the globalists\n[1453.9s] they said policies where they snatch the\n[1455.6s] land from them and that is what is\n[1457.2s] coming in this country it is coming so\n[1460.4s] are you ready the question is are you\n[1462.6s] ready anyway if there's any leader any\n[1465.8s] person who disputes what I'm saying I'm\n[1467.7s] ready call me for an interview anywhere\n[1470.0s] CNN BBC Al jaaz K call me

aegis page 36 paragraph two desire of edges that six point two in the same are the people whom god had called to the to be the pillar and ground of truth had become representatives of satan they were doing the work that he desired them to do taking a course to misrepresent the character of god and caused the world to look upon him as a tyrant the very priests who ministered in the temple had lost sight of the significance of the service if they performed they had ceased to look beyond the symbol to the things signified in presenting the sacrificial offerings they were as actors in a play the ordinances which god himself had appointed were made the means of blinding the mind and hardening the heart god could do no more for man through these channels the whole system must be swept away in a s i want to link them with this parable which we are studying another parable about it soma verse 12. they had healed themselves systems that could no longer hold water now a certain man held a great supper just happened now this is one of the parables i'm going to link israel in the seventh day adventism at the end of time one of the parables i'm going to link israel in the seventh day adventism yes in in in in parables trying to link those who shall live at the end of time tonight luke chapter 14. luke chapter 14 jesus gave another parable to link these happenings and occurrences luke chapter 14 verses number 16 luke chapter 14 verses number 16 amen amen a certain man made a great supper this is not breakfast this is not lunch hour call this is supper time now on a somatic chapter 20 that great clock began early hour in the morning until the 11th hour labourers that is nearing the supper time the 11th hour 9 11. no no it begins at early morning breakfast the great advent millerite movement the sixth hour laborers and then when it's nearing supper time just before the 11th hour laborers are called in that is where luke chapter 14 features because this parable is mentioning the great supper that has been beaten to call people in okay this is a special message for god's people who have been given much light at the end of time so this message is god gives another final bid to them first listen to this a certain man made a great supper not a great breakfast not a great lunch hour meal it is a great supper so this parable must be put in its proper location high tomorrow then he called and sent his servant at supper time supper time not breakfast supper time when it's it is nearing the 11th hour in upper caribbean when it is nearing the supper time put these things in your mind i come to mom tomorrow cool at great supper time i wanna all things are ready come to the supper time all things are ready my friends the bible teaches that god has prepared a message at suppertime for seventh-day adventism god intends to bring this message to god's people moon attacker quality what god is talking about the bible says i have bought a piece of field it must needs that i go and see it fast okay that is the first group i have bought a field the first group the second group of individuals they have bought oxen they must go and see them and test them i pray forgive me i am not coming to the great supper this message is preached first to adventism it is not it is not preached to the world at first within jerusalem okay these are three categories of people in adventism a letter message yes [Music] in another parable let's just expound on the field that is being brought here they have volta field they must go and see the field and how it is prospering i have no time for that message okay the field that is brought luke chapter number 12. okay luke chapter number luke chapter number 12 verses number two verses from versus number 16 luke chapter 12 verses number 16. the first group of individuals have bought a field okay so they don't see the great invitation at supper time okay there is a great message just before the crisis just before the loud cry of the third angel goes forth god brings this sort of message as supper time but the first group of individuals on a semano we have just bought a field these are the first group of individuals in adventism because what shall i do sit down my soul relax eat and drink your grounds has brought a lot of increase you are rich and increased with goods satan has blinded their eyes to the things of the world they cannot appreciate the things that are of eternal interest at supper time okay and it's not just any other message god will bring in the message that will arouse god's people to go back to their foundational truths you see jesus was the foundation of the whole jewish economy but the israelites why would you come qatar yes their foundation they had rejected him and they remained to be fig trees with the leaves and without without fruits meat for repentance so how i wanted look at luke chapter 12 verse 21 it continues to say devio um verses number 24 the bible says the billionaire seymour luke chapter 12 those who lay up treasures on earth and they are not uh they are not rich towards god we must be very keen that this invitation comes between the ninth and the eleventh hour there is a message that god must bring to his people just to arouse them just to show them that it is time to prepare for the loud cry of the third angel but the first group of individuals on a semapana sisi took on amalia dunya okay took on amalia dunya okay the bible says in luke chapter 21 verse 34. luke 21 verses number 34 luke 21 verse 34 in a semester take heed unto yourselves jesus said that your hearts may not be overcharged with the suffering drunkenness and the things of this earth that that day shall come upon you unawares for us as near shall it come upon all that dwell upon the earth in adventism we are told okay in the book in the book ali writings writings in the book early writings we are told early writings amen early writings in the book ali writings or spiritual gifts we are told page 267 ali writings 267 paragraph number 266 paragraph 1 early writings 266 paragraph 1 i saw that satan baby's angels lay their snares especially for those who are looking for christ's second appearing and keeping all the commandments of god satan told his angels that the churches were asleep what the churches were asleep he would increase his power and lying wonders and he could hold them but he said the sect of sabbath keep us we hate they are continuously working against us and taking from us our subjects to keep the hated law of god look at what satan does go make the processes of lands and money drunk with the chaos if you can make them place their affections upon these things we shall have them yet they may profess what they please only make them care for money than for the success of christ's kingdom or the spread of the truth we hate present the world before them in the most attractive light that they may love and idolize it we must keep in our ranks all the means of which we can gain control the more means the followers of christ devote to his service the more will they injure our kingdom by getting our subjects that one disqualifies them from the great supper and that specific message about a moon on a letter at supper time it is a message to revive and reform god's people let's go back to the book of matthew chapter 14. to build on this matthew chapter 14 remember this is part one of the topic nominal adventism or the remnant takuya conglomerate part two i'm just building luke chapter 14 verses matthew 14 sorry versus number 23 at suppertime there is a message to arouse the people in the ship and jesus went to arouse the people in the boat that lacked faith in that particular ship now on a suffering america jesus had to come to them and why that is why we see ellen white writing in the book last day events page 210 paragraph one let me just read it again to connect supper time a message that will give the baron fig tree hope of not being cut spare it this year also the fourth year is the probationary the fourth message that fourth angel must arrive in history to give hope to god's people and to arouse them from their spiritual liturgy last day events page 210 paragraph one last events page 210 lde page 210 paragraph 1 then we'll go to those who have married a wife and then we'll build our topic from there as to why israel must be cut if it does not produce fruits meat for repentance last day events page 210 paragraph number one paragraph okay lde to 10 209 i say sorry lde 209 oh sorry i had ticked a book early writings let me just untick first yes last day events to 10 lde to 10.1 what is the message that god must bring here at the end of time it says it's also from review and herald in a talk review and herald may 27 1890 okay she says there is to be in the seventh-day adventist churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of god and but it will not move upon those who have not humbled themselves before the lord and opened the door of the heart by confession and repentance she says in the manifestation of that power which lightens the earth with the glory of god they will see only something which in their blindness they think dangerous something which will arouse their fears and they will brace themselves to resist it because the law does not work in accordance to their ideas and expectations they will oppose the work why they say should we not know the spirit of god when we have been in the work for so many years then listens she says anasema the third angel's message will not be comprehended the light which will lighten the earth with its glory will be called a false light by those who refuse to walk in its advancing glory sasa there is a message that is to come at supper time but the rich and increased with the goods on assam associated the other category of individuals these three categories of individuals they will continue to show the green leaves look at the third group of individuals we go back to luke chapter 14. we are reached and increased with good and have need of nothing we don't want that invitation to take that is the problem with laodicea you see it is fatal blindness nasa's spiritual prophet and we put things in order luke chapter 14 look at the third group of individuals in adventism is what is hindering the third group of individuals from heeding that invitation that jesus has suddenly come to his temple to arouse them that is disqualifying them [Music] from becoming partakers of this particular message okay let us build this from the bible revelation 14 verse 4. revelation chapter 14. revelation 14 concerning god's people in the last days the bible teaches others these are they which are not defiled with women for they are virgins they profess a pure holy faith they cannot be married to the women of the land this has been a problem in all ages and this is one of the reasons as to why at supper time some will forfeit the invitation and they will disqualify themselves in giving the third angel's message marrying wives strange women in the bible we see people doing that solomon loved many strange women he disqualified himself and god questioned him we see israel doing the same in the times of ezra let's build this in the bible let's build this in the bible we see it happen in the times of ezra the bible teaches that they marry strange women i've just quoted king solomon in in first kings chapter 11 verse 1. that is king solomon and again we see in the times of ezra nehemiah in the times of ezra nehemiah we see the holy seed mingling itself with strange women we are in the book of ezra now uniforte visuri the third group is saying we have married wives we have just married ezra chapter 9 verses 1 and 2. this has been repeated over and over and over and over in the history of god's people marrying women strange wives ezra chapter nine moon ezra chapter nine the bahrain fig tree is it nominal adventist or the remnant first samuel second samuel first king second kings ezra nehemiah we are in the book of ezra second kings i am handling first kings first second kings first chronicles second chronicles then ezra ezra chapter nine amen to kopali mandika and i say my a entered into an abomination of marrying the wives of the land in the parable of luke chapter 4 14 the third group says we have married wives they have joined themselves into apostate protestantism and they have accepted their doctrines they have accepted to be one with them you see bibliona and get this very carefully is one of the reasons as to why god must raise the people to give the loud cry of the third angel it's one of the reasons you see we are told we are told in testimonies for the church volume 4 page 2 11 paragraph 2 testimonies 40 testimonies for the church volume 4 page number 211 paragraph number two we are told we are told we are told and listen very carefully we are told i'm beginning from paragraph number one it is satan's plan to weaken the faith of god's people in the testimonies next follows skepticism in regard to the vital points of our faith the pillars of our positions then doubted us to the holy scriptures and then the downward march to perdition when the testimonies which were once believed are doubted and given up satan knows the deceived ones will not stop at this and redoubles its efforts till he launches them into an open rebellion which becomes incurable and ends into destruction satan gained marked advantage in because the people of god have not guarded the outposts the very men whose labors god has signified that he would accept if they were fully concentrated have been the ones to be deceived to fail in their duties and to prove a terrible burden and discouragement instead of the help and blessing that they should have been these men who have been trusted to keep the fought have well now betrayed it into the hands of the enemy that awaited us betrayal they have betrayed god into the hands of the enemy they have opened the gates to a willie four enemy who has sought to destroy them men of experience have seen stealthy hands sleeping the balls that satan might enter yet they have held their peace with apparent indifference as to the results some have been glad to see this as it seemed an extenuation of their past neglect which made it a necessity to call for others to fill the posts of responsibility that they had abused or neglected they have betrayed to the enemy they have married themselves to the wives wives testimonies volume 8. near the fallen churches it makes adventists to become nominal wannabe representatives hawana they have nothing that can show totally that these are god's people they remain in name wakanda append testimonies testimonies volume 8 80 page 249 ht page 249 paragraph number three testimonies volume 8 page 249 paragraph 3 in a sema the heavenly teachers inquire what stronger delusion can beguile the mind than the pretence that that you are building on the route right foundation and that god accepts your works when in reality you are working out many things are called according to worldly policy and are sinning against jehovah oh it is a great deception amen they are saying they have married okay it is a great deception a fanaticism a fascinating delusion that takes possessions of the mind when men who have once known the truth must take the form of godliness for the spirit and power thereof when they suppose that they are rich and increased with goods and in need of nothing while in reality they are in need of everything god has not changed toward his faithful servants who are keeping their garments spotless but many are crying peace and safety while sudden destruction is coming upon them shaw kai mayweak or conomit unless there is a thorough repentance unless men humble their hearts by confession and receiving the truth as it is in jesus they will never enter heaven who can truthfully say our gold is tried in the fire our garments are unspotted by the world i saw our instructor pointing to the garments of so-called self-righteousness stripping them off he laid bare the defilement beneath then he said to me can you not see how they are potentially pretentiously covered up the defilement and rottenness of character how is the faithful city become unharlot my father's house is made a house of mechanized a place once the divine presence and glory have departed for this cause there is

have fallen churches nominal adventists and before the plagues shall be poured out ministers and the people will be called out from these churches and will gladly receive the truth satan knows this and before the loud cry of the third angel is given he raises an excitement in these religious bodies that those who have rejected the truth may think that god is with them he hopes to deceive the honest and lead them to think that god is still working for the churches but the light will shine and all who are honest will leave the fallen churches and take their stand with the remnant fallen

ripened into open hatred and the hearts of the people were turned away from jesus who heard the truth the sanhedrin had rejected christ's message and was bent upon his death therefore jesus departed

baby's angels lay their\n[2710.5s] snares especially for those who are\n[2712.1s] looking for christ's second appearing\n[2714.3s] and keeping all the commandments of god\n[2717.0s] satan told his angels that the churches\n[2719.4s] were asleep what\n[2721.5s] the churches were asleep\n[2723.2s] he would increase his power and lying\n[2725.4s] wonders and he could hold them but\n[2730.3s] he said\n[2731.6s] the sect of sabbath keep us we hate\n[2734.7s] they are continuously working against us\n[2737.6s] and taking from us our subjects to keep\n[2741.0s] the hated law of god look at what satan\n[2743.6s] does\n[2744.7s] go\n[2745.5s] make the processes of lands and money\n[2748.4s] drunk with the chaos\n[2750.6s] if you can make them place their\n[2752.3s] affections upon these things\n[2754.4s] we shall have them yet they may profess\n[2758.3s] what they please only make them care for\n[2761.0s] money than for the success of christ's\n[2763.5s] kingdom or the spread of the truth we\n[2766.2s] hate\n[2767.0s] present the world before them in the\n[2769.1s] most attractive light that they may love\n[2772.6s] and idolize it\n[2774.5s] we must keep in our ranks\n[2777.3s] all the means\n[2778.8s] of which we can gain control the more\n[2782.1s] means the followers of christ devote to\n[2783.9s] his service the more will they injure\n[2785.9s] our kingdom by getting our subjects\n[2803.0s] that one disqualifies them from the\n[2805.4s] great supper and that specific message\n[2809.4s] about a moon on a letter at supper time\n[2811.4s] it is a message to revive and reform\n[2813.8s] god's people let's go back to the book\n[2815.4s] of matthew chapter 14.\n[2817.6s] to build on this matthew chapter 14\n[2819.7s] remember this is part one\n[2822.2s] of the topic\n[2823.9s] nominal adventism or the remnant takuya\n[2826.6s] conglomerate part two i'm just building\n[2829.8s] luke chapter 14 verses matthew 14 sorry\n[2832.7s] versus number 23\n[2835.5s] at

that particular ship now on a\n[2911.1s] suffering america jesus had to come to\n[2913.8s] them\n[2915.2s] and why that is why we see ellen white\n[2917.3s] writing in the book last day events page\n[2919.3s] 210 paragraph one let me just read it\n[2921.0s] again to connect supper time\n[2923.7s] a message that will give the baron fig\n[2926.2s] tree hope\n[2927.8s] of not being cut\n[2932.8s] spare it this year also the fourth year\n[2937.0s] is the probationary the fourth message\n[2940.6s] that fourth angel must arrive in history\n[2944.2s] to give hope to god's people and

paragraph 1 then we'll go to those who\n[2965.1s] have married a wife\n[2967.1s] and then we'll build our topic from\n[2968.8s] there as to why israel must be cut\n[2972.7s] if it does not produce fruits meat for\n[2975.1s] repentance\n[2976.7s] last day events page 210\n[2979.0s] paragraph number one\n[2981.7s] paragraph\n[2983.0s] okay lde to 10\n[2986.1s] 209 i say sorry\n[2988.8s]

message\n[3009.2s] that god must bring\n[3012.3s] here at the end of time it says it's\n[3014.2s] also from review and herald in a talk\n[3016.2s] review and herald\n[3017.7s] may 27 1890\n[3020.8s] okay\n[3022.6s] she says\n[3026.4s] there is to be in the seventh-day\n[3028.2s] adventist churches a wonderful\n[3029.8s] manifestation of the power of god\n[3032.5s] and but it will not move upon those who\n[3035.2s] have not humbled themselves before the\n[3037.1s] lord and opened the door of the heart by\n[3039.2s] confession\n[3040.4s] and repentance\n[3041.9s] she says\n[3043.2s] in the manifestation of that power which\n[3046.2s] lightens the earth with the glory of god\n[3048.9s] they will see only something which in\n[3050.8s] their blindness they think dangerous\n[3053.3s] something which will arouse their fears\n[3055.8s] and they will brace themselves to resist\n[3057.6s] it because the law does not work in\n[3059.6s] accordance to their ideas and\n[3061.1s] expectations they will oppose the work\n[3063.8s] why they say should we not know the\n[3066.2s] spirit of god when we have been in the\n[3068.4s] work for so many years then listens\n[3071.8s] she says anasema the third angel's\n[3074.2s] message will not be comprehended the\n[3076.2s] light which will lighten the earth with\n[3077.8s] its glory will be called a false light\n[3079.8s] by those who refuse to walk in its\n[3081.5s] advancing glory\n[3083.4s] sasa\n[3085.4s] there is a message that is to come at\n[3087.0s] supper time\n[3088.6s] but the rich and increased with the\n[3091.0s] goods on assam associated\n[3093.5s] the other category of individuals\n[3098.2s] these three categories of individuals\n[3100.7s] they will continue to show the green\n[3102.5s] leaves\n[3112.4s] look at the third group of individuals\n[3116.2s] we go back to luke chapter 14.\n[3127.8s] we are reached and increased with good\n[3130.6s] and have need of nothing we don't want\n[3133.6s] that invitation\n[3135.6s] to take\n[3137.8s] that is the problem with laodicea you\n[3139.5s] see\n[3140.4s] it is fatal blindness nasa's\n[3143.3s] spiritual prophet\n[3144.9s] and we put things in order\n[3148.2s] luke chapter 14\n[3150.1s] look at the third group of individuals\n[3152.6s] in adventism\n[3163.0s] is\n[3169.3s] what is hindering the third group of\n[3172.2s] individuals\n[3173.6s] from heeding that invitation\n[3176.7s] that jesus has suddenly come to his\n[3179.2s] temple to arouse them\n[3210.4s] that is disqualifying them\n[3212.3s] [Music]\n[3213.7s] from\n[3215.8s] becoming\n[3217.1s] partakers of this\n[3219.1s] particular message\n[3221.3s] okay\n[3229.4s] let us build this from the bible\n[3230.9s] revelation 14 verse 4.\n[3234.1s] revelation chapter 14.\n[3238.6s] revelation 14\n[3240.5s] concerning god's people in the last days\n[3242.4s] the bible teaches\n[3247.0s] others\n[3256.9s] these are they which are not defiled\n[3260.2s] with women for they are virgins\n[3263.0s] they profess a pure holy faith\n[3266.1s] they cannot be married to the women of\n[3268.3s] the land this has been a problem in all\n[3271.0s] ages and this is one of the reasons as\n[3273.4s] to why at supper time\n[3275.1s] some will forfeit the invitation and\n[3278.2s] they will disqualify themselves in\n[3280.6s] giving the third angel's message\n[3286.4s] marrying wives strange women\n[3291.0s] in the bible we see people doing that\n[3292.8s] solomon loved many strange women\n[3295.9s] he disqualified himself and god\n[3298.1s] questioned him\n[3299.6s] we see israel doing the same in the\n[3301.4s] times of ezra\n[3303.6s] let's build this in the bible\n[3305.8s] let's build this in the bible\n[3307.9s] we see it happen in the times of ezra\n[3311.2s] the bible teaches\n[3313.8s] that\n[3315.0s] they marry\n[3316.6s] strange women\n[3319.5s] i've just quoted king solomon in in\n[3322.2s] first kings chapter 11 verse 1.\n[3329.6s] that is king solomon\n[3333.7s] and again we see in the times of ezra\n[3335.8s] nehemiah\n[3342.6s] in the times of ezra nehemiah we see the\n[3344.9s] holy seed\n[3347.3s] mingling itself\n[3350.5s] with strange women\n[3353.8s] we are in the book of\n[3355.8s] ezra\n[3357.9s] now uniforte visuri\n[3360.1s] the third group is saying we have\n[3362.2s] married wives\n[3375.0s] we have just married\n[3377.5s] ezra chapter 9 verses 1 and 2.\n[3381.1s] this has been repeated over and over and\n[3384.3s] over and over in the history of god's\n[3386.9s] people marrying women strange wives\n[3392.2s] ezra chapter nine moon\n[3396.8s] ezra\n[3398.5s] chapter nine\n[3400.5s] the bahrain fig tree is it nominal\n[3402.6s] adventist or the remnant\n[3406.2s] first samuel second samuel first king\n[3408.4s] second kings\n[3409.9s] ezra\n[3411.2s] nehemiah we are in the book of ezra\n[3414.9s] second kings\n[3417.4s] i am handling first kings\n[3420.2s] first\n[3421.2s] second kings first chronicles\n[3423.5s] second chronicles then ezra ezra chapter\n[3426.6s] nine amen to kopali\n[3429.9s] mandika and i say my\n[3500.2s] a\n[3515.2s] entered into an abomination of marrying\n[3518.1s] the wives of the land in the parable of\n[3520.6s] luke chapter 4 14\n[3522.8s] the third group says we have married\n[3525.2s] wives\n[3526.2s] they have joined themselves into\n[3528.9s] apostate protestantism and they have\n[3531.4s] accepted their doctrines they have\n[3533.8s] accepted to be one with them you see\n[3537.4s] bibliona\n[3538.5s] and\n[3539.1s] get this very carefully\n[3541.7s] is one of the reasons as to why god\n[3545.3s] must raise the people to give the loud\n[3547.0s] cry of the third angel\n[3549.0s] it's one\n[3550.4s] of the reasons\n[3552.3s] you see\n[3554.4s] we are told\n[3556.6s] we are told in testimonies\n[3559.4s] for the church\n[3560.9s] volume 4 page 2 11 paragraph 2\n[3565.3s] testimonies 40\n[3569.2s]

carefully\n[3592.2s] we are told i'm beginning from paragraph\n[3594.6s] number one it is satan's plan to weaken\n[3596.9s] the faith of god's people in the\n[3598.2s] testimonies\n[3599.8s] next follows skepticism in regard to the\n[3602.0s] vital points of our faith\n[3604.1s] the pillars of our positions then\n[3605.8s] doubted us to the holy scriptures\n[3608.0s] and then the downward march to perdition\n[3610.7s] when the testimonies which were once\n[3612.6s] believed are doubted\n[3614.6s] and given up satan knows the deceived\n[3617.8s] ones will not stop at this\n[3619.8s] and redoubles its efforts\n[3621.9s] till he launches them into an open\n[3624.5s] rebellion which becomes incurable and\n[3627.7s] ends into destruction\n[3629.8s] satan gained marked advantage\n[3633.4s] in\n[3634.6s] because the people of god have not\n[3636.6s] guarded the outposts\n[3638.5s] the very men whose labors god has\n[3640.5s] signified that he would accept if they\n[3642.9s] were fully concentrated have been the\n[3645.0s] ones to be deceived\n[3646.9s] to fail in their duties and to prove a\n[3649.5s] terrible burden and discouragement\n[3652.6s] instead of the help and blessing that\n[3654.6s] they should have been these men\n[3657.7s] who have been trusted to keep the fought\n[3660.9s] have well now betrayed it into the hands\n[3664.4s] of the enemy

destroy\n[3683.9s] them\n[3687.0s] men of experience have seen stealthy\n[3689.4s] hands sleeping the balls that satan\n[3691.8s] might enter yet they have held their\n[3694.4s] peace with apparent indifference as to\n[3697.1s] the results some have been glad to see\n[3700.2s] this as it seemed an extenuation of\n[3703.8s] their past neglect which made it a\n[3706.1s] necessity to call for others to fill the\n[3708.4s] posts of\n[3709.4s] responsibility that they had abused or\n[3711.9s] neglected\n[3715.9s] they have betrayed\n[3718.8s] to the enemy\n[3724.5s] they have married

that surrounds our church General Conference and General Conference 7.20 GC SDA General Conference seventh Adventists those people are reading the lessons those people are in Pathfinders who are Marching like much like Jehovah Witnesses those people are matching like Freemasons General Conference SDA this charge that was pure once pure is now being corrupted by the hidden writes hidden customs General Conference SDA where their children are burning candles during rights or ceremonies rights of Ceremonies like induction they're burning candles so we are talking of true education when is true education needed all right when is true education needed by God's people when is the true education message given we are calling God's people from other churches while we are not calling them from corrupt institutions educational institutions that is wrong God's people must at this time prepare to give the loud cry when the great storm comes storm of tests and trials welcome let's pray we are praying Father in heaven we thank you so much for sending us your son whom we believe and trust he will open up to us the book seal within and without written within and without so that we may understand events that are to take place and that we may also understand and comprehend the love in which you have loved us with broad high low hour or wide Lord we know you have loved us with the love that no any other can measure with God we know you do not spare your son and now we are more than conquerors we only need to understand give us strength for understanding your grace is sufficient in our weakness strength is given for them that are asking and those who Hold Up Hold Your Hand will gain strength and make peace with thee give us strength in Jesus Christ we pray amen so we are told that we have to understand the time in which we are living in all right let us see is that a habit in the time of our living okay all right all right okay so we are seeing we are asking ourselves what is the time in which you are living you and I live do we need to education right now there's some people are saying ah to education honest was in seventh Adventures it was taught long time ago let me read your quote I'm reading you two quotations to understand that their true education was kept for the last days in these days for you to understand it is in these days you have to understand the science of the time so that like in level in Romans Chapter 13 Verse 11. knowing the time that the day is drawing now let us wake up from the sleep then we will not be like the sleeping foolish virgins although they all slept but the wives streamed their lungs in the night let us dream their life let us see we are told that God's people are to Institute uh schools and home schools in the last days there is a book called educational messenger educational messenger spiritual prophecy is going to tell us that in these last days we are supposed to have true education not education with gay system with Eastern religion meditation those are things that shows you it's time wake up all right Wake Up Wait faithful Watchman speak keep not silent we are told is educational messenger ah it has no Pages I'm going to read the first paragraph in the whole chapter educational messenger spiritual prophecy oh my friend all my friends seven Adventists in great in general conference General Conference will not help you as according to what they are doing whatever they are doing is not the first Angel message my friends the angel that is in Revelation 14 6 is seeing to preach to those who are dwelling upon the Earth those who have cultures those who have Tribal doctrines their Book of Revelation shows us water is to come general conference leaders Ted Wilson is teaching us to keep on dressing like the women men to dress like we how can a man dress like a woman what are those things how can you dress like a woman because it is culture so the first Angel message is wrong right it is not to preach to people Nation or tribes or Kindred we are told this let me cool down all right educational messenger it is saying it is dated July 31st 1908 it is after true education has been institution instituted in 1970s we are going to give that history 1970s true education began in service Adventure but this is a prophecy if you love prophecy then let's keep up with this with the pace of the third Angel message let's see July 31st 1908 titled homeschools all right home schools it's saying as Church schools shall be established in the future as Church schools shall be established in the future there is a class of work to be done there is a class of work to be done in connection with them that has not been done in the past oh so there is a light based on true education in the future all right in the closing events Christ is telling us that the work that has been done in the past there shall be our connection to it in the LA in the future so let's see that has not been done in the past all who can who can all who can should or Lucan should have the Privileges of a home church school welcome this is gilgil this is gilgil nakuru County my name is Michael Brown I'm going to take you through all events as they are connected with two education and two church this will be a true church God's people gathered not not General Conference things those people are receiving types to go around the world to put on dress and lower the standards what are those giving us headache in order for prosecution to begin they will just do that let's continue see we are told through education is to take place in the future there's someone who was telling me and I prayed over this that Lord provide convincing truths we are told that true education is to be done in the future read this book uh in the future a few some few weeks uh coming few weeks I'll be able to post this quotation as I'm reading them I'm sorry because the facilities uh I'm raising some money for this Slowly by slowly the work is to go forward by faith and by men of prayer let's see this book is called educational messenger if you have a smartphone download Ellen G white E G white application downloading and install all those books it's time for probation we have to read God is going to give us facilities and if you are in need of one ask God and Shout speak up like right now we are going to see July 31st 1908 this passage has been written in in general conference General Conference has been established by now General Conference was established in 1863. right now three education schools in general conference seven Adventist churches has been established the true education schools were established the Avondale schools the Loma Linda schools that they were on on track coming the uh we have awkward awkward Auckland Oakwood yeah we have those schools the first one began in 719 in 1870s now this is a prophecy for seven Adventists saying as Church schools shall be established in the future there is a class of work to be done in connection with them that has not been done in the past so in the future there is a work that is to be done in connection to the true education that had begun so those people know how to wait to wait unto the Lord they have to know the time 2001 was the time we're going to establish that just give us time now we are reading all who can should all who can should have the Privileges of a home Church School age Church in the school home church school right people have to be taught how to live how to depend on themselves how to be morally upright how to be spiritually strength stronger how to be physically fit how to be knowledgeable in all things reason it will be well if several families in the neighborhood in our neighborhood will unite to employ a humble God-fearing teacher to give the parents the help that is needed in educating their children these are future prophecy somebody asked me Andy told me two education have been there that cannot be the present Truth Listen to this see anything there that schools shall be established in the future all right when the first Angels come down there is a class of work to be done in connection with them there is a class of work in connection to be done in connection with them that has not been done in the past in 1840 1844 1888 or 1870 or 1900 it has not been done but it shall be done in the future a walk so we have to ask what is this we are not going to speculate we are going to ask the Lord as he's going to open the few the the parts of righteousness we are told in Psalms 97 verse 1 verse 11 Psalms 97 11. truth is sown for the Russians we want that truth to be sown God is going to sow unto us the truth is going to come for them that are standing family God is going to give us and we are going to look forward for these events that we cannot fall we are going to stand with the God who controls the will within a will he's going to give us strength to overcome the Beast to overcome the image to overcome the number to overcome the Beast name itself we are going to overcome God is going to give us strength as we're going to strive the condition let us strive for that and let us not in the Middle with affairs with the human Affairs oh I I don't have a work I don't have one to marry I don't have one more to marry one to marry me we are not going to enter middle God is going to provide whatever we need God is going to give us and remember we are not oh thank you my friends ah my friend is just liking this video and we are just going to strive let us strive without a house without a cloth without food without shoes without anything right now we began building the school for your information and all this structure are start at a standstill you can see let me turn

understandings they're seeing some few paperworks and all these Landers you're seeing the donor gave it someone gave it up so that we may build at her own supervision she want to see the work go forward she want to see that this land is to be made use of to give God glory god is going to come down and give and and Crown duties and Crown our efforts that we commit unto him all this land has been given behind the toilet as you see there is a land go there is a line of demarcation down to defend and there is another line behind the toilet up just up there is an arboretum as you see that is our Sanctuary up up four to the fast forward to the fence on top we are going to ask them that are of good ability come in and come in and build that which the Lord is saying that we should call people out of institution popular schools as well as we are calling them from churches that are falling let us see is that a quote Oh the second quote tells us as the time comes to call people from Fallen churches there are no names if you want General Conference we are going to prove that general conference is amongst those churches right now we have we don't want crutch no one is we want to establish that the truth right now taking place is to call people from foreign churches and to call people from Fallen popular schools adapting purple Supremacy principles principles that are in concluding to children in order to obey the mark of the beast and the image of the Beast listen I'm going to read from I'm going to read from this book called pamphlet again once more I already eat in

popular churches are only a\n[1290.2s] product of worldly education so to get\n[1292.9s] at the root of the matter we must\n[1295.5s] separate ourselves from that which\n[1297.1s] creates the condition it creates the\n[1299.5s] condition schools create the condition\n[1302.2s] of Babylon Fallen schools create the\n[1304.9s] condition of Babylon of hidden the\n[1309.1s] hidden School make

controversy 356 paragraph true the main point here is to establish that the foundations of this spiritual house adventism must be laid under the first and the second angel's messages 1840 1844 in fact 1798-1844 that is the period of the first and the second angel's messages the bible say a spirit of prophet says concerning the apostle paul the apostle paul warned the church not to look for the coming of christ in his day that they shall not come says paul except there come inner falling away and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition not until after the great apostasy and the long period of the reign of the man of sin can we look for the advent of christ the man of sin which is also styled the mystery of iniquity moana before the son of perdition and that wicked represents the papacy which as foretold in prophecy was to maintain its supremacy for 1260 years this period ended in 1798 the coming of christ could not take place before that time paul covers with his caution the whole of the christian dispensation down to the year 1798 it is this side of that time that the message of christ's second advent who can be proclaimed no such message has ever been given in the past ages paul as we have seen did not preach it concerning the message of judgement hakubi sayokum he pointed his brethren into the far distance future for the coming of the lord the reformers did not

fast angel's message arrives in history welcome abu hayao kamawaz mana tukidu ahivya kuramuta tutikisa if god lays the foundation of adventism when the first angel's message arrives in history 1798 to 1844 keeping the hitchhiker moving up to me matthew chapter 7 verse 21 matthew chapter 7 verses number 21. the bible teaches yes honorable matthew chapter seven was twenty-one appendix spiritual prophecy supplements what the bible actually it it gives light to what the bible already has written because let our foundation be in the bible first we will have a lot of peace and confidence in whatever we are we are believing or we are teaching matthew chapter 7 verses number 21 24 24 sorry it says he shall be likened unto a man that lays or build his house upon a rock so the foundation must be built upon the rock the rock who is christ himself okay why do we say the foundation must be built upon the rock and the rock is christ himself you see when the foundation zilianza coequa as earlier 1798 candela did you know that jesus himself came down to empower the movement movement chapter 10 verses number one philadelphian experience 1840-1844 revelation chapter 10 verses number one

go to the book of matthew 17. the angel's face was shining like the sun that is what that angel's face usually does matthew chapter 17 verses chapter one to your universe i'll have to repel it to only

himself and of course the rainbow was upon his his head when he came down this mighty angel okay so jesus is the foundation of adventism when the foundations were being laid missing bc bible commentary volume seven ana sema and i say maybe bible commentary volume bible uh seven bc nafkiri i'm a trasomata christian triumphant there are many books at an endicott seven bc about the economy the bible commentary volume 7 page 971 paragraph 3 she says the mighty angel who instructed john was no less a personage than jesus christ setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot upon the dry line shows the part which he is acting in the closing scenes of the great controversy with satan amen amen so the bible affirms that this is jesus 1840 august 11 1840 the mighty angel descends with a little book open the book of daniel and the great advent millerite movement is empowered because jesus is the foundation we will enter into a great period of debates in adventism do we stick to the foundations or do we destroy the foundations and begin rebuilding the walls anew okay this malachi chapter 3 the three comings of jesus to his temple malachi chapter 3 the bible says in malachi chapter 3 verses number one amen these are called biblical prophetic parallels ambassadors 1840 to 1844 the great advent movement the foundations of adventism while aids malachi chapter 3 the

messenger or a message that is to prepare the people to welcome the lord to come to his temple appendocrine because jesus comes to his temple literally yes and we see john the baptist being the preparer of the way for the literal coming of christ to his literal temple whatever matthew chapter three the first fulfillment of malachi chapter three fulfills in matthew chapter two angali the first fulfillment me my concern is how does it fulfill in the philadelphia and experience me upon you nico okay matthew chapter 3 the bible says this was the voice that was crying in the wilderness prepare the world way of the lord the lord is suddenly coming to his temple and jesus came when jesus came to his temple he labored amongst his people they reject christ okay now that was the first time when jesus was coming to his temple that was literally yes in the book great controversy we have a whole topic called in his temple but what about the second time because this is john the baptist who is movement the philadelphian experience uh luke chapter one amen luke chapter one the first time jesus came to his temple was in the time of ephesus 1840 to 1844 mana you and your mother uh luke chapter one john came in the spirit and the power of elijah allahu spiritual prophecy naturally according to the great advent millerite movement you see a similarity luke chapter 1 and verses number 17. the bible says in luke chapter 1 verses number 17 amen luka modiakuminasa so john shall go before christ in the spirit and power of elijah that is the first time when jesus is coming in his temple the first time look at it the second time revelation chapter 10 yes he comes to empower that great advent movement 1842-1844 and that is the second time when jesus comes in his temple the second time skeletal spirit of prophet sinatra behave spirit of prophecy says in early writings 233 ali writings page 233 paragraph 1 early writings page 233 paragraph one look at what spiritual prophecy says concerning that movement she says she says when milarite movement was raised by god i saw that god was in the proclamation of the time in 1843 it was his design to arouse the people and bring them to a testing point were they where they should decide for or against the truth ministers were convicted of the correctness of the positions taken on the prophetic periods and some renounced for their pride and left their salaries and their churches to go forth from place to place to give the message but as the message from heaven could find a place in the hearts but of but a few of the professed ministers of christ the work was laid upon many who are not preachers some left their fields to sound the message in anywhere ministers laid aside this is paragraph three they are sanctarian views of and feelings and united in proclaim proclaiming the coming of jesus it continues those whose lives had been marked with dishonesty were anxious to make restitutions parents felt the deepest solitude for their children it was a period of repentance pointy anguish she says thousands were led to embrace the truth preached by william miller and the servants of god were raised up in the spirit and the power of elijah to proclaim the message like john the forerunner of jesus those who preached this solemn message felt compelled to lay the axe at the root of the tree and call upon men to bring forth fruits need for repentance so you see 1840 empowerments and his companions they were raised in the spirit and power of elijah wakapeleca amen this is the second time jesus comes to his temple okay these are called prophetic parallels yes his temple revelation 18 about angelia queso that mighty angel again must come down just before the final crisis three times jesus comes to his temple maratha anakulamaka temple yak in the times of john the baptist philadelphia fss in the times of philadelphia and the times of laura kia maratha three histories linked together that is why elenota nasima in great controversy 6 11 paragraph 1 the mighty angel that comes down to lighten the earth with his glory that final movement movement here mushroom will be likened to the movement of 1840 to 1844 amen amen amen amen yes matthew 7 24 that the house that is built upon the rock can not fall when the storm comes there is a crisis the san diego crisis is likened to the storm spiritual prophecies nasima as the storm approaches many who have professed faith in the third angels message and have not been sanctified by it they will abandon their positions and join ranks with the enemy what storm is coming apart from the sunderland crisis now yes when i say my number uh you what does the bible teach matthew chapter 7 verse 21 to summit the foundation is laid before the mighty angel comes down the foundation continues to be laid until 1844 s okay when the lord shall open the reigns the windows of heaven the great outpouring of the lattering that corinthians chapter 3 verses number 11. the bible says in first corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. the foundations are laid under the first message and the second message full stop those who go back to the foundations to find fault with the foundations can never receive the latter rain and work the final messages of the lovecraft that are dangerous now that can you very clearly and that is why we will have debates in adventism worldwide people will begin debating because they are those who are leaving the platform the foundations of adventism niko kartika first corinthians uh chapter number three verses number 11 first corinthians chapter 3

they see and your ears for they hear for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you have seen and they have not been able blessed are the eyes we saw the things which was seen in 1843 and in 1844 the message was given and there should be no delay in repeating the message 40 41 42 43 44 all the messages foundational truths the message was given and there should be no delay in repeating the message for the signs of the times are fast fulfilling the closing work must be done what is the closing work it is the loud cry of the third angel when revelation 18 comes to reality the closing work must be done a great work will be done in a short time a message will soon be given by god's appointment that will swell into a loud cry then daniel will stand in his lot to give his testimony california whatever point of doctrine you are controversing right now i want to find a debate it does not matter whether you are conscious or not whether you are debating these truths consciously or unconsciously people are taking positions do we return back to our foundational truths or do we remain on the platform that has been built on timbus writings that is where trouble began early writings let me search for early writings and then to rudy katkapibilia philadelphia experience 1842 1844 the foundation was laid by god himself uh another quotations ali writings that the vitelli on yeshua spiritual gifts spiritual gifts volume 1 of kiriko 1sg spiritual gifts volume 1 1 sg page 168 paragraph 2. okay spiritual gifts 258 paragraph three listen to how spiritual prophecies linking these prophetic lines spiritual gifts or ali writings 258.3 ali writings 258.3 she says i saw a company well guarded and farmed nikauna ki kunichawatumbacha waliku naimara omisimama giving no countenance to those who would unsettle the established faith of the body god looked upon them with a probation i was shown three steps the first second and the third angel's message said my accompanying angel woe unto him that shall move a block or star pin of these messages the true understanding of these messages is of vital importance the destiny of souls hangs in the balance in the manner in which these messages are received i was again brought down through these messages and so how dearly the people of god had purchased their experience what was reported experience yeah philadelphia experience it had been obtained through much suffering and severe conflict god had led them along step by step until he had placed upon them a solid immovable platform solid immovable yeah i saw individuals approach the platform and examine the foundation some with rejoicing immediately stepped upon it others commenced to find the fold with the foundation they wished improvements made and then the platform would be more perfect and the people much happier some stepped off the platform to examine it and declared it to be laid wrong the foundation was laid wrong let's step off the platform listen and the people must appear some step of the platform to uh to examine it and declared it to be laid wrong but i saw that nearly all stood upon the farm platform and exhorted those who had stepped off to seize their complaints for god was the master builder and they were fighting against him they recounted the wonderful work of god which had led them to the farm platform and in union raised their eyes to heaven and with a loud voice glorified god an honor then on a semi i was pointed back to the proclamation of the first advent of christ john was sent in the spirit and power of elijah to prepare the way for jesus those who rejected the testimony of jesus of john were not benefited by the teachings of jesus their opposition to the message that foretold is coming place them in a worst position where they could not really receive the strongest deletion so anatomy the immovable platform the bt 1840 to 1844 mungo america are debating our foundational truths just know something in your mind that platform is immovable it has been laid upon a solid foundation nada white and ander cosima the foundation of advertising adventism consists of truths okay concerning the truth in consoles on writers and editors cw page 29 paragraph one consoles and writers consoles to writers and editors cw page twenty nine paragraph one let the truths that are the foundation of our faith be kept before the people let the truths that are the foundation of our faith be kept before the people how could semia comba let theologians or some people go and examine the foundation and replace them and bring them before the people no no no no no no no no no no worldwide adventism there are so many people professing to be seventh-day adventism but when you begin to examine their foundation it is built upon sand it is built upon timbus they have left the platform of eternal truth 1798 to 1844 46 years letter the first angel's message the second annual message the third angel's message is john chapter 2 verse 19. i am not going to touch the 46 years but i'm going to rebuild it in three days three days 46 years the 46 years are there 1798 to 1844 but the three days now god brings the first angel's message the first day the second angel's message 1842 the second day then the third angel's message october 22 1844 the house begins to be built the foundations are laid and they are upon a solid platform let the truths that are the foundation of our faith be kept before the people some will depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils hajja say massam will depart from the church you can't be in the church but not in the faith of the first second and third angel you are not in the foundation and this is a difference that most adventists have never even realized in pakistan you see you can't be in the church but outside the faith that's why paul says in second corinthians thirteen verse one even appalling ana sema ii corinthians chapter 13. the bible says verses number five second corinthians 13 verse 5. the bible says yeah test yourselves whether you be in the faith not you've been the church you can't be in the church but not in the faith that faith that lays the foundations okay she says in cw 29.1 some will depart from the faith giving heed to say this in spirits and doctrines of devils they talk science and the enemy comes in and gives them an abundance of science but it is not the science of salvation it is not the science of humility of concentration or of the sanctification of the spirit we are now to understand what the pillars of our faith are the truth that have made us as a people what we are leading us on step by step amen amentopia review and herald of may 25 1905. that point is clear and that is why unapologetic let's go back to the bible when the children of israel came out of babylon and they went to rebuild the foundation okay there's something that happened very funny you see when you begin to lay another foundation it cannot be powerful or perfect as the first foundation that god laid i wish i can let's go to the book of hagai hagai they cry why do they cry kuan nino analia the reason is they they look at these foundations which are being led laid out and now let's go to haggai chapter hey chapter chapter chapter one the bible teaches in hege or hagai depending on how you'll pronounce it the bible says hagai chapter 2 we are in the book of hagai chapter 2 the bible says who amongst you saw the former house in its initial glory 1842 1844 and how do you see it now 2021 munao who can compare adventism 1840 to 1844 and now from 1888 to 2021 these are two different periods why because the foundation that was laid 1840 1844 at the foundation that was laid again during the time of reorganization are two different things now okay so my statement just one more time [Music] haggai is prophesying how god is going to shake the entire act so that the desire of nation jesus comes back to his temple the third time revelation 18 and that is the topic of tomorrow you see even if the house is inferior god still knows he must shake the heavens and the earth and the desire of nations christians the purpose of the fourth angel the purpose of the desire of nations to come back to his temple is to speak to the children of israel that they accept their foundations to be fit for the outcry of the tad angel selected messages book one page two or four one sm nini ko mi fanika page 204 okay paragraph one ninja fanica paragraph two one sm two four paragraph two selectors messages book one page two or four paragraph two skeletal the enemy of souls has sought to bring in the suppositions of it that a great reformation matanganeso was to take place among seventh-day adventists and that this reformation would consist in giving up the doctrines which stand as the pillars of our faith and engaging in a process of reorganization reorganization reorganization shikka your point wakati what um reorganization they have left the foundation and they cannot be fit for the loud cry of the third angel it means that god must raise a people to be fit for the louder of the third angels the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are we the temple of the lord the temple of the lord avi hawaii they engage in the process of reorganization why this reformation to take place what would result number one the principles of truth that god in his wisdom has given to the remnant church would be discarded our religion would be changed the fundamental principles that have sustained the work for the last 50 years would be accounted as error a new organization would be established shikha your point of visual a new organization seventh-day adventism worldwide church is operating under a new organization and by mccoy established books of a new order would be written a system of intellectual philosophy would be introduced the founders of this system would go into the cities and do a wonderful work the sabbath of course would be likely regarded as also the god who created it nothing would be allowed to stand in the way of this new movement chica your point the leaders who teach that virtue is better than vice but god being removed shekel your point god being removed they would place their dependence on human power which without god is worthless their foundation would be built on sand tonight matthew 7 24 and the storm and the tempest would sweep away the structure then she says who has an authority to be in such a movement we have our bibles we have our experience attested by the miraculous working of the holy spirit we have a truth that admits of no compromise shall living out repediate me to the iceberg there you are won't got track sequencer ana sema uh philadelphian experience revelation chapter 3 we go back there relation chapter 3 philadelphia experience we must put on christ's righteousness we must accept christ as the rock the foundation we must accept and go back to the foundational truths that christ placed in the time period of philadelphia that is the experience that is to give the loud cry now quotations are quotation okay skeleton let us first read philadelphia revelation chapter three the bible says in verses number eight behold i give thee those who are of the synagogue of satan so those who will go back to the philadelphia experience flock nataka spirit of prophet who are the synagogue of satan mana took akubali kurudi to the experience to the experience of philadelphia of obviously philadelphia experience word to the little flock word to the little flock wlfw lf uh let me just search it wlan wlf page

this class were professed adventists okay these class were professed adventists who had fallen away and crucified themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame and in the hour of temptation sunderland crisis in the hour of temptation which is here to come to show out everyone's true character they will know that they are forever lost and overwhelmed with the anguish of spirit they will bow at the saints feet whether these are professed adventists how was he watching redeemed they cannot they cannot be in the lottery the loud cry they cannot partake of the righteousness of christ god cannot trust them with his message okay they had built upon timber and sands that is very unfortunate many shall come to me saying lord lord have we not eaten with you have we not done have you not done then christ will say to them away from me i never knew you that is how serious it is even if you live catechalia the lord came down to establish their faith upon an immovable rock an

know those who are stepping off the foundation what they're thinking whatever truth god gave us between 1798 and 1844 when we step off that foundation debates will come in adventism debates so debates that is the purpose of god you are trying to show people the warning has come nothing is to be allowed to come in nothing is to be allowed to come in that will disturb the foundation of the faith upon which we have been building ever since the message came in 1842 1843 and in 1844 i was in this message i was in this message and ever since i have been standing before the world true to the light that god has given us amen we do not propose to take our feet off the platform on which they were placed as day by day we sought the lord with earnest prayer seeking for light skriza will anasema do you think that i could give up the light that god has given me it is to be asked the rock of ages amen it is to be asked the rock of ages those the foundational truths are the rock of ages it has been guiding me ever since it was given brethren and sisters god lives and reigns and works today his hand is on the wheel and his providence he is turning the wheel in accordance to his own will because those foundational truths are the rock of ages okay kamata the rock of ages god will qualify you to give the loud cry of the third angel that is why jeremiah says to his people jeremiah stand in the crossroads and see and ask the ancient parts where is the way okay okay if you remove the platform we are doing harm it is to be as the rock of ages the rock of ages the rock of ages amen amen amen amen amen the rock of ages so when god laid that foundation and funny enough in the philadelphia experience illinois says the mighty angel who is to unite with the third angel in the work of the loud crave the third angel is to unite with the third angel for the last work then she says the advent movement of 1842-44 was a glorious manifestation of the power of god people were united brethren they

people\n[2012.9s] they reject christ\n[2014.6s] okay\n[2015.7s] now that was the first time when jesus\n[2017.4s] was coming to his temple that was\n[2019.4s] literally yes\n[2025.6s] in the book

last month egypt said that its wheat\n[52.4s] reserves will not last more than three\n[54.4s] months\n[55.6s] next we have tunisia the birthplace of\n[57.3s] the arab spring its economy is\n[58.8s]

the bible says there shall be time of trouble when michael finishes the work of mediation james psalms 132 17 psalms 132 surrounds jesus because jesus is the source of spiritual growth kukuwa kiroho [Music] lettering is all about how christ resurrects his people from the dead psalm chapter 18 verses number two there is no burden if christ is not the center yes psalm chapter 18 verse 2 jesus is the horn of salvation and the bible says that god shall bud shall shall cause the to happen to occur in israel the horn of salvation pembe is all about the manifestation of jesus to his people and they call la quanza verses number three the latter rain causes the burden the latter rain is all about the revelation of jesus this the horn of salvation pembe and bioni avocado hosea chapter six verses number three we believe in the book of hosea chapter number 6 let us go forth forward to know the lord good okay he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter rain oh so the lattering that causes the burden the manifestation of the holy spirit is the revelation of jesus so the holy spirit is the revelation of christ himself the holy spirit is not a third god called god the holy spirit it is christ himself the holy spirit is the spiritual nature the divine personality of christ himself his very life ohio it is not the third person god the holy spirit is psalm 72 verses number six that is why there is a lot of weakness because god's people want to among us it is the manifestation of christ himself that will cause the burden when god begins to take his work to another level psalms chapter 72 verses number six english and swahili psalm 72 verse 6 i'll be using two languages the awato as a color so that people may understand what i am talking about psalm 72 versus number six in fact for the purpose of context water to answer i acquaints psalm 72 verse 1 in assembler give the king thy judgment oh god and thy righteousness unto the king's son habakkuk [Music] all judgment has been given to the sun john chapter 5 verse 22. we have the king's son that has been given judgment verse 17 verse number six now you know the king's son jesus himself shall descend as rain that is the second time we'll see the bible giving us evidence that the holy spirit the manifestation of jesus himself his very life it is not a third personality to a god the holy spirit no it is the manifestation of jesus himself okay congratulations psalm 72 6. psalm 72 verse 6 psalm 72 6 and this is the greatest deception abayo says you see this is a deception of the highest order psalm 72 verse 6 in king james version psalm 72 verse 6 king james version says he referring to the king's son jesus he shall come down like rain upon the mount grass as showers that water there so who comes down as rain the spiritual reign the holy spirit it is jesus himself case closed we proceed we proceed so the bible teaches that aaron's road that murdered birding is caused by the latter rain when the showers begin and burning happens just before the harvest is now spiritual prophecy in one of the books he shall receive power receive power this is what ellen white says in this book called yrp is now connecting how the latter rain is to be revealed to god's people in these last i i can also read from another book because i've seen the same quotation in a book called uh we have so many compilations uh in the spirit of prophecy but uh for the purpose of record uh this is review and herald review and herald of april 21 1891 review and herald april 9 21 1891 paragraph 7 i think it says the latter rain is to fall upon the people of god for so a mighty angel is to come down from heaven and the whole earth is to be lighted with his glory are we ready to take part in the glorious work of the third angel there is a question so ellen white takes the latter rain and connects the latter in to the coming down of the mighty angel of revelation chapter 18. remember we are talking about the budding of aaron's road and how god will take forward his work from there hello it says the latter rain is to fall upon the people of god a mighty angel is to come down from heaven now this is revelation 18. we begin our series now let us begin our series because revelation 18 is the final laterin and la terrain revolves around that that fourth angel that angel is called the mighty angel that angel the fourth angel and by the way for your own information the fourth angel is the manifestation of the righteousness of christ himself let me build on this we are talking about the things that must transpire before jesus comes how the work of god must progress when the birding begins when the latter rain begins and this happens just before the harvest just before the harvest when god takes his own work in his own hands and there is a reason as to why god must do that we are reading from the book of habakkuk chapter 2 verse 14. habakkuk chapter 2 verses number 14. the bible says concerning revelation 18 the final budding the budding is caused by the latter rain aaron's road that budded is the final message to adventism before the harvest that they may read and understand how god's work is to be done in the last days god is to choose a leaders of his own heart to finish the work amen habakkuk chapter 2 verse 14. for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the waters fill the earth that is prophetic of revelation 18. revelation 18 shows how the mighty angel is to come down from heaven and by the way this mighty angel is christ himself because he is the one who is to initiate the budding and to choose the leaders in israel in these last days those whom he has appointed himself he must do that because kama yes so we cannot trust the leadership of this time among us god's people and there is a reason for that remember in the first session we are constantly on a combat the history of israel is a striking similarity of what adventism would be in the last days it is a striking similarity amen how let me just do a little recap because before we we tackle revelation 18 and show how the burden begins and then we go to history we show we show what what has happened we are in 2022. what has happened why is it there is much debating in adventism today on our foundational truths what is happening is it that god is taking his work to a next level and many do not realize like it happened in the jewish nation except you study the prophetic lines to understand these events let us progress the history of the israelites is the history of seventh-day adventism hosea chapter six micah chapter six verse four six verses number four maika chapter six verses number four the bible says biblionas for i brought thee up out of the land of egypt speaking of israel and i delivered thee from the house of bondage names and i sent forth moses haron and miriam to go before thee so israel as a nation they had three messengers to go before them it is only seventh day adventism that god has given us the fast angel's message revelation 14 verse six montgomery patriots moses patty at the second angel's message revelation 14 verse 8 haron god has given us the third angel's message miriam and it's so coincidence that cover miriam and ellen g white were both women they were both ladies it's very interesting because the rise of the third angel 1844 ellen g white is given the spirit of prophecy miriam but wait a minute they were not the messengers that took part in that very event of of taking the children of israel to the promised land it was joshua so joshua comes in as the fourth message and the fourth messenger revelation 18 is joshua the final attack on jericho i the babylon that must fall god's people must be prepared for that final work it must begin in israel israeli and joshua when joshua gets in by the way when joshua begins his work jesus himself speaks the bible says in the book of deuteronomy chapter number one deuteronomy chapter number one deuteronomy chapter number one bible says deuteronomy the bible says in the autonomy i and your money know most alien israeli water and hamburghani these are the ones that moses told the children of israel on the other side of the show of jordan and when moses had spoken those words of course he brought up joshua to take forth the bible continues to say joshua chapter number one joshua was told to be strong because the lord was going to be with him he should not fear uh the the reproach of the nations and even the israelites that is deuteronomy chapter one deuteronomy chapter two and after that moses dies and when we begin in the book of joshua we see the instructions given to joshua as plain and explicitly clear i want you to take the children of israel into the land of canaan the fourth message is the message that finishes the work this is the ministry of joshua the fourth angel revelation 18 that causes the burden and god must select leaders to guide his people you must elect god's leaders to guide these people back to go forth into there to the promised land into the promised land into the promised land now revelation 18 is the manifestation of jesus jesus himself manifests himself in the latter rain so the latter rain is the revelation that is a message that the bible teaches the latter rain is the manifestation of jesus rome takatifu when god pours forth his spirit he manifests he manifests his son christ jesus and his righteousness to his people that they may be prepared to stand in the trials that come but wait a minute is it true that jesus must come to try to awaken people that slumber in this in the ship yes and what is the purpose of the lottery what is the purpose of the burden remember who shall speak in behalf of israel god and to intervene god had to show openly through the body that this is the leader the tribe of levi i have chosen them because aaron's road has muttered let's go to matthew chapter 23 matthew chapter 23 jesus is the fourth messenger jesus is associated with number four remember the book of hosea says that hosea chapter 6 says is going forth is as the morning and it shall come to us as the rain as the as the latter rain when jesus revealed himself prophetically it is asked the morning good morning put that in your mind was this out here matthew 23 versus number 14 matthew 23 14 verse 23 matthew chapter 14 verses number 23 matthew chapter 14 verses number 23 the bible says when he had bid farewell to the to the multitudes ali panda murimani faraga nakuri when it was evening the ship was in the midst of the sea those who are looking at this prophetically we understand that the sheep is is is refers to the church that bears god's people the winds were blowing contrary so the ship was troubled in the midst of the sea that is what is happening to adventism because the sheep is being tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine every weed of doctrine the bible continues to say in a sema heart in the fourth watch of the night jesus revealed himself to them in the fourth watch the bible is specific it was the fourth watch of the night that jesus revealed himself and manifested himself to his people that were in the ship to try to bring back their faith they are being tossed to and fro to and fro by the winds of false doctrines there is much to fear from within than from without there is much to fear from within the doctrines that are beating around god's people many of them are from within god's people have lost an anchor the bible is specific it was the fourth watch of the night that jesus manifested himself now maybe we should ask the bible able to listen bibilia what is the name given to the fourth watch of the night because jose chapter 6 verse 3 says when jesus manifest himself to his people in the latter end he's going forth is us the morning morning now let's see what is the name given to the fourth watch of the night mark chapter 13 verse 35 mark chapter 13 verses number that five mark chapter 13 verses number that five we are reading from the book of mark marico cominato natano listen very carefully the bible says the fourth watch of the night has a name mark chapter 13 verse at five the bible says in mark 13 verse 35 this is not the second coming of jesus this is the manifestation of jesus to his people his house the church the four watches of the night let me read in english watch ye therefore for ye no not when the ma when the master of the house cometh at even at midnight or at coke growing or in the morning so the fourth watch of the night is called the morning so this is the time period prophetically when jesus manifested himself to his people in the lettering hosea chapter six verse three and he shall come to us as the latter in his going forth is us the morning it is the morning prophetically to begin to we proceed when jesus manifested his himself to the people who were in the sheep at the fourth watch of the night peter thought that they had seen a ghost that is what they thought the first fulfillment of when jesus wanted to manifest himself to his people the first fulfillment occurred in 1888 let us see whether ellen white writes the same let's see whether he writes this the very first attempt was in 1888 by the way i'm just reading last day events page 210 paragraph nine last day events last day events page 210 paragraph uh paragraph two last day vince page 210 paragraph paragraph number lde 210 paragraph 2. she says there is to be in the seventh day adventist churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of god you see it is the power of god so the holy spirit is the power of god i hear so many arguments people say the holy spirit cannot be the power of god the holy spirit is a separate person from the father and from jesus is the third being separate from the father and the son that is what adventism believes that is what the world teaches but that is not what the bible and the spirit of prophecy teaches elenor says there is to be in the seventh day adventist churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of god we can show this from the bible that the holy spirit is the power of god we can show it luke chapter 1 verse 35 it's the power of god so you cannot separate the power of god and put god aside and put his power aside and say that is god and that is another god no i also have some power i can lift some heavy some heavy gadget can you separate my power from myself no it cannot happen you need one always that is false that is deception of the highest order and that is why satan has brought in his deception the last apostasy omega of apostasy that began with the kellogg is here with us and many adventists have never realized that today luke chapter 1 verse 35 before i read last event concerning the power of god the holy spirit is the power of god luke chapter 1 verse 35 the holy spirit is not a third god called god the holy spirit separate from god separate from christ no no no no even wrong luke chapter 1 verse 35 luke chapter 1 verse 35 i'm just showing you i love in the universe of kundalini the bible's by the way it's very easy the bible is very easy to understand luke chapter 1 verse 35 and the angel told mary that the holy spirit shall descend upon thee and the power of the most high shall be upon you so the holy spirit is the power of the most high now is there a possibility that the power of the most high is a different person from god or from christ himself no that is not true the power of god who is the power of god look at the book of first corinthians chapter 1 verse 24 first corinthians chapter one first corinthians the bible says who is the power of god we've seen it's very interesting so unto those who are called the jews and the greeks it is christ the power of god so the latter name the holy spirit is the manifestation of the power of god christ jesus is the power of god and to his people amen the bible has has never been this clear before bibili that is a deception last lastly events page 2 10 paragraph 1 the bible uh spiritual prophet says there is to be in the seventh-day adventist churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of god who is being manifested it is christ himself the power of god but it will not move upon those who have not humbled themselves before the lord and open the door of the heart by confession and repentance listen to this now in the manifestation of that power which lightens the earth with the glory of god oh so that power must lighten the earth with the glory of god okay put that in mind they will see something which in their blindness they will think dangerous like villa me too they they were in the ship when they saw the manifestation of jesus in the fourth hour fourth watch of the night they saw something dangerous this is the history of adventism 1888 something which will arouse their fears and they will brace themselves to resist it because the law does not work in accordance to their ideas and expectations they will oppose the work why they say should we not know the spirit of god when we have been in the work for so many years the third angel's message will not be understood or comprehended the light which will lighten the earth with the glory of god will be called a false light by those who refuse to walk in its advancing glory let us put things together now this is the history of adventism in 1888 wakati mungualiwatuma juana mewavili e.j wagona and jonas wakatuli letter message righteousness by faith the revelation of the righteousness of jesus in the latter rain it was not the revelation of god the holy spirit it was the revelation of jesus himself now wait a minute she says in the manifestation of that power which lightens the earth with the glory of god the glory of god who lightens the earth with the glory of god by the way let us go to revelation 18 verse one able to saw me revelation how can people say the holy spirit is a third god called god the holy spirit well the bible is clear it is the manifestation of christ himself and his character to his people revelation 18 started working relation 18 by the way seventh day adventism is in a great delusion even of even how how to receive the lettering it is a great delusion that is why people can go to weeks of prayer expecting some power some other power apart from christ and the father himself that is not true revelation 18 verse 1. after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven ah having great glory the glory of god and he cried mightily with a loud voice let us go to john chapter 11 to show that this is jesus this is the fourth angel must come to show his glory let us see remember lazaro lazarus had been dead for four days i'll come across by the way yes the fourth day to show his glory he came to manifest his glory on the fourth day listen very carefully i'm just showing you line up online that revelation 18 is the manifestation of jesus himself not god the holy spirit it is christ himself jesus christ himself and if you cannot understand that it is christ himself you cannot give the first angels message correctly because already you are showing the world that you are worshiping a different god than the father and the son the bible is clear and this is life eternal that they might know you the only true god and jesus christ whom that was sent we were not told to know an attack being i took one beauty what it is a deception john chapter 11 verses john chapter 11. the bible says in verses number 17 it was the fourth day when jesus arrived let me jump the history i'm going straight to the point from verses number 39 yes this is the fourth day your friend has been dead yes welcome here did i not tell you mata that if you believe thou shalt see the glory of god jesus came to reveal the glory of god to those who were surrounding and to his friend who was dead he came the fourth day basically yes verse 43 is very key jesus is there on the fourth day he is manifested he wants to manifest the glory of god look at verse 43. [Music] he cried with a loud voice revelation 18 and the mighty angel cried with a loud voice that is jesus himself we are done we are done that is christ himself aaron's wrote that burden when jesus begins to manifest himself to his people the very first attempt maria consider 1888 1888 the very first attempt 1888 and the leadership of god's people rejected the message where is the fourth angel if the leaders rejected the message of righteousness by faith the manifestation of the character of jesus has it ever been accepted no the only condition by which that message and that power would be upon god's people is a confession of sin kutubudabi general conference president now um that is what the bible teaches in the book of hosea chapter 5 verse 15. let me show you something that has never happened by the way hosea then we'll go to malachi as we begin to bring this slightly to an end hosea chapter 5 verse 15 hosea chapter 5 verse 15 this is prophetic of what happened or transpired in 1888 kitumbacho kilifanika 1888 the fourth angel nita kwandazangu i will now go forth and return back to my place nakuparudiyamapang when there is to be a corporate confession of the scene of 1888 the angel can go back to the general conference but if that will never happen the general conference can never be the recipient of the spiritual power in the last days that is to prepare god's people for the loud cry and to stand in the last days that one we should put in our minds now yes and this is why we'll begin to see how aaron's road begins to blossom by the way in the book of malachi chapter number three there's a whole topic in the book deserve ages that is called in his temple remember psalms 132 says that god shall shall cause the budding of the horn in the house of david israel christ will manifest himself in the ring malachi chapter 3. malachi chapter number three the bible says in malachi chapter number three verses number one the first prophetic fulfillment of the arrival of christ in history the bible says and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple nam julem jumbo organo even the messenger of the covenant shall suddenly come to his temple the bible teaches that when jesus comes suddenly to his temple he shall sit as a refiner to refine his work will be to separate two classes of worshippers because he will come with power the very first fulfillment of this prophecy in his temple in afghanistan when jesus manifest himself the very first time to his people and this prophecy also can be connected with the prophecy of haggai chapter two chapter two and malachi chapter three due to ezekiel letter these prophetic lines pamoja remember this is the second part he'll come to kudua the purpose of this presentation is to let the people know the work of god in the final portion of this earth history in a fanika tv how does the work of god go forward in in a country again does god depend on the leadership that has apostatized will god use them anymore or will god show through the budding of the aaron's road that he has selected a new leadership for his people in the times of the body let's go to hagai hagai hagai the book of haggai chapter number two hagiai the book of hagiai hagiai chapter number two it depends on where you come from some people say hey some people say haggai hagai chapter 2 the bible says that the lord will suddenly come to his temple but who shall stand because when he cometh to his temple he is like a refiner he separates two classes of worshippers whether we are conscious or whether we are not conscious depending on whether we have received the light or whether we have rejected the light of the budding the burden forth the very message that jesus wants us to understand in these last days again chapter 2 this is a message that is very key speak unto the remnant of the children of israel saying amongst you who is left that saw this house in its initial glory adventism we are living in 2022. who saw adventism in 1840 1844 who saw it 1840-1844 is there anyone amongst us was there alive no we are the children of our father's faith israel who saw this house in its initial glory it was just powerful when god had laid the foundational truths and how do you see today we're going to answer the questions as we progress be a strong serum why is it that the lord is saying that they should be strong i'm reading verse 8. it says look at this versus number seven god will do something in israel when the burden begins when the prophecy of psalms chapter 132 begins to fulfill when when the burden when that horn wakati pembe israeli maria this is the first time before jesus comes back in revelation chapter 18 in the manifestation of that power of god the very first time is when jesus is born in bethlehem and is raised amongst his people and goes to his temple physically to his temple this is the very first time of the fulfillment of the prophecy of malachi chapter 3 and haggai chapter 2. the bible says the bible says and i will shake the the entire world the nations and the desire of nation shall come and i will fill this house with the glory of god amen the desire of ages is jesus before he comes there must be a shaking of the entire earth the message of his coming must shake the earth and that is why in the times of herod wakati herod the whole of jerusalem was troubled with the message because the message was coming from the east and the magaya uh they did not know the time of their visitation they did not know that god is coming to take his work to another level two classes of worshippers will develop those who will continue to stand firm in the platform that jesus stood pla farm for because jesus was the foundation of the jewish economy yes so jesus was coming back to manifest himself for the very first time and this is the purpose of the lettering even in the last days look at what spirit of prophet says she says look at this it says in the book called let me let me see this book uh i want to show you what jesus came to do his his very own revelation she says desire of ages page 288 listen very carefully desire of ages chapter 29 this is page 218 888 she says the savior had not come to set aside what the patriarchs and the prophets had spoken that was the foundation for he himself had spoken through these representative men all the truths of god's word came forth from him but these priceless gems had been placed in false settings their precious light had been made to minister to era while coming by you'll see your moonwale god desired them to be removed from their settings of error he had desired that israel be removed from their setting of error and and had replaced them with the framework he came to replace those errors in the framework of truth this work only a divine hand could accomplish by its connection with the error the truth had been serving the cause of the enemy god and of god and man christ had come to place it where it would glorify god and work the salvation of humanity amen eras that is the very essence of the lettering because the latter rain is the manifestation of jesus when jesus begins to bring the truth the leaders cannot accept the truth because the foundational truth thou jesus must begin another work he must begin a new work and let the blind leaders the blind guides to continue to think that they are the temple of god yes what our channel they rejected the truth the sun henry that is the history of the lattering it begins with the fss it goes forward to philadelphia by the way these three churches are very important when we study the history of the birding of aaron's road la zima to do history revelation chapter 18 he's only saying that the manifestation of the character of god to set back the foundational truths and to begin a work that many people will not understand let us let us read desire of aegis 232. when the latter rain begins jesus must take a new direction look at what happens in in israel when jesus manifestation manifested manifested the glory of god when he manifested the glory of god okay look at what happened look at what happened these are wages deserve ages desired of ages page 232. without wages page 200 and number 32 listen let's give zuri 232 paragraph one she says she says if the leaders in israel had received christ he would have honored them as his messengers to carry the gospel to the world at assassination allowed to cry we must have the burden jesus must be manifested again to his people fast fast but the message first goes to the leaders in israel if they had accepted christ if they had accepted the glory of god if they had accepted the angel of revelation 18 in a nutshell she says god would have honored them as his people to take the gospel to the world she says to them first was given the opportunity to become heralds of the kingdom of grace of god but israel knew not the time of her visitation the jealousy and distrust of the jewish leaders had ripened into open hatred and the hearts of the people were turned away from jesus so the leaders had the problem they did not want to go back to their foundational truths they do not want to accept the message that jesus had brought up that is the purpose of the to to put aside error and to cause the people of god to stand on the platform of eternal truth look at what happened sikhi aquititum the sun henry had rejected christ's message and was bent upon his death walitaka okay therefore jesus departed from jerusalem muji from the priests vyongoziwadini from the temple mariam bapu mung gariquanaka the religious leaders the people who had been instructed in the law and returned to another class to proclaim his message god had begun to collect a people that he can use to take his message while the leaders continued to think that they were still god's chosen messengers what a deception what a deception jesus went to gather out those who should carry the gospel to all nations listen now as we bring this for close listen very closely as the light and life of man was rejected jesus is the light and the life of men the holy spirit gives the life of jesus so the holy spirit again is the life of christ it is not god the holy spirit somebody separate and distinct from jesus it is the very life and the very nature of jesus himself that is what the spiritual prophet says yes as the light and life of man was rejected by the ecclesiastical authorities in the days of christ so it has been rejected in every succeeding generation tuna be upper again and again the history of christ's withdrawal from judea has been repeated when the reformers preach the word of god the foundational truth because the reformers have accepted that jesus is the foundation they have accepted not error but the truth they have accepted to return the people back to the platform of eternal truth they had no thought of separating themselves from the established church leaders would not tolerate the light and those who had the light were forced to seek another class who are longing for the truth in our day few of the prophets followers of the reformers are actuated by their own spirit few are listening for the voice of god are ready and ready to accept the truth and whatsoever guys it may be presented in reformers conference churches ambassador our next topic will be tackling what is the church canis aninini is the general conference they church we will begin by tackling the history of the latter rain and the fourth angel and we are going to understand what the church is and how god is to finish the work in the last days what would you want to say jesus sought another class he left the priest he left jerusalem he left the temple he left the religious leaders matthew chapter 13 verse 15. yes i kept let them alone that is matthew chapter 15 verse 13. iron throat that burden we have seen so far that when jesus manifest himself he manifests himself in the holy spirit to reveal the glory of god to his people so that god's people may be established in their foundational truths when we come to part three we are going to move forward to 1888 from 1888 2022 where is the fourth angel has jesus manifested himself to us today is the work of god taking a different dimension what work are we supposed to support in the last days how will we know that the work of god has taken a different dimension god bless you amina",

now\n[777.4s] you know\n[788.5s] the king's son jesus himself shall\n[791.2s] descend as rain\n[793.8s] that is the second time we'll see the\n[795.5s] bible giving us evidence that the holy\n[797.9s] spirit the manifestation of jesus\n[799.9s] himself his very life\n[802.2s] it is not a third personality to a god\n[804.3s] the holy spirit no it is the\n[806.2s] manifestation of jesus

deception of the\n[831.3s] highest order\n[832.6s] psalm 72 verse 6 in king james version\n[836.9s] psalm 72 verse 6 king james version says\n[840.2s] he referring to the king's son jesus he\n[843.4s] shall come down like rain\n[845.8s] upon the mount grass as showers that\n[848.6s] water there\n[849.8s] so who comes down as rain the spiritual\n[852.5s] reign the holy spirit it is jesus\n[854.5s] himself case closed we proceed\n[858.9s] we proceed\n[860.2s] so the bible teaches that aaron's road\n[862.3s] that murdered birding is caused by the\n[864.4s] latter rain\n[865.5s] when the showers begin and burning\n[868.2s] happens just before the harvest\n[877.9s] is\n[884.0s] now\n[885.5s] spiritual prophecy\n[888.2s] in\n[889.0s] one of the books\n[892.3s] he shall receive power\n[898.0s] receive power\n[902.5s] this is what ellen white\n[906.2s] says\n[908.2s] in this book called yrp\n[916.2s] is now connecting\n[918.0s] how the latter rain\n[919.8s] is to be\n[920.9s] revealed to god's people\n[923.4s] in these last\n[925.8s] i i can also read from another book\n[927.8s] because i've seen the same quotation\n[930.5s] in a book called uh\n[941.4s] we have so many compilations\n[944.4s] uh in the spirit of prophecy\n[947.6s] but uh for the purpose of record\n[951.6s] uh this is review and herald\n[954.4s] review and herald of april 21 1891\n[959.8s] review and herald\n[961.7s] april 9 21 1891\n[964.7s] paragraph 7 i think it says\n[967.6s] the latter rain is to fall upon the\n[969.4s] people of god\n[970.9s] for so\n[972.0s] a mighty angel is to come down from\n[974.2s] heaven and the whole earth is to be\n[976.2s] lighted with his glory are we ready to\n[978.7s] take part in the glorious work of the\n[980.4s] third angel there is a question\n[982.6s] so ellen white\n[984.6s] takes the latter rain and connects the\n[987.0s] latter in to the coming down of the\n[989.1s] mighty angel of revelation chapter 18.\n[991.6s] remember we are talking about the\n[993.0s] budding\n[994.2s] of aaron's road and how god will take\n[996.8s] forward his work from there\n[1003.3s] hello it says\n[1005.4s] the latter rain is to fall upon the\n[1006.9s] people of god a mighty angel is to come\n[1009.5s] down from heaven now this is revelation\n[1011.3s] 18. we begin our series now\n[1014.5s] let us begin our series because\n[1016.3s] revelation 18 is the final laterin\n[1019.9s] and la terrain\n[1021.3s] revolves around that that fourth angel\n[1025.1s] that angel is called the mighty angel\n[1028.0s] that angel the fourth angel and by the\n[1030.7s] way\n[1031.9s] for your own information\n[1035.4s] the fourth angel is the manifestation of\n[1037.9s] the righteousness of christ himself\n[1041.0s] let me build on this\n[1045.0s] we are talking about\n[1047.7s] the things that must transpire before\n[1049.7s] jesus comes\n[1051.1s] how the work of god must progress\n[1054.0s] when the birding begins when the latter\n[1056.6s] rain begins\n[1057.8s] and this happens just before the harvest\n[1060.6s] just before the harvest\n[1063.1s] when god\n[1064.3s] takes his own work in his own hands and\n[1066.4s] there is a reason as to why\n[1068.2s] god must do that\n[1077.0s] we are reading\n[1079.0s] from the book of\n[1080.9s] habakkuk chapter 2 verse 14.\n[1084.3s] habakkuk chapter 2\n[1087.4s] verses number 14.\n[1094.6s] the bible says concerning revelation 18\n[1098.2s] the final budding\n[1100.2s] the budding is caused by the latter rain\n[1102.8s] aaron's road that budded\n[1105.6s] is the final message to adventism before\n[1108.6s] the harvest\n[1109.8s] that they may read and understand how\n[1112.3s] god's work is to be done in the last\n[1114.1s] days\n[1115.5s] god is to choose a leaders\n[1118.2s] of his own heart\n[1119.9s] to finish the work amen\n[1122.4s] habakkuk chapter 2 verse 14.\n[1131.0s] for the earth shall be filled with the\n[1132.9s] knowledge of the glory of the lord as\n[1134.9s] the waters fill the earth\n[1137.0s] that is prophetic of revelation 18.\n[1139.6s] revelation 18 shows how\n[1142.7s] the mighty angel is to come down from\n[1144.4s] heaven\n[1145.5s] and by the way this mighty angel is\n[1147.5s] christ himself because he is the one who\n[1149.6s] is to initiate the budding and to choose\n[1152.3s] the leaders in israel in these last days\n[1155.5s] those whom he has appointed himself he\n[1158.3s] must do that because kama yes\n[1162.8s] so\n[1164.9s] we cannot trust the leadership of this\n[1167.4s] time\n[1168.2s] among us god's people and there is a\n[1169.8s] reason for that\n[1171.0s] remember in the first session\n[1173.9s] we are constantly on a combat the\n[1175.7s] history of israel is a striking\n[1178.6s] similarity of what adventism would be in\n[1181.2s] the last days it is a striking\n[1183.0s] similarity\n[1184.3s] amen\n[1185.5s] how\n[1187.4s] let me just do a little recap because\n[1189.8s] before we we tackle revelation 18 and\n[1192.1s] show how the burden begins and then we\n[1194.1s] go to history we show\n[1196.1s] we show what what has happened we are in\n[1198.5s] 2022. what has happened why is it there\n[1201.0s] is much debating in adventism today on\n[1204.1s] our foundational truths what is\n[1205.6s] happening\n[1206.6s] is it that god is taking his work to a\n[1208.2s] next level and many do not realize\n[1211.6s] like it happened in the jewish nation\n[1219.0s] except you study the prophetic lines to\n[1221.0s] understand these events\n[1222.7s] let us progress\n[1225.1s] the history of the israelites is the\n[1227.0s] history of seventh-day adventism hosea\n[1229.8s] chapter six\n[1231.4s] micah chapter six verse four\n[1236.3s] six verses number four\n[1239.4s] maika chapter six verses number four\n[1243.0s] the bible says biblionas\n[1249.0s] for i brought thee up out of the land of\n[1252.1s] egypt speaking of israel\n[1257.4s] and i delivered thee from the house of\n[1259.1s] bondage\n[1260.4s] names\n[1265.7s] and i sent forth moses haron and miriam\n[1269.7s] to go before thee\n[1271.4s] so israel as a nation they had three\n[1273.4s] messengers\n[1274.5s] to go before them it is only seventh day\n[1276.5s] adventism\n[1277.7s] that god has given us the fast angel's\n[1280.2s] message revelation 14 verse six\n[1282.2s] montgomery patriots\n[1284.2s] moses\n[1285.9s] patty at the second angel's message\n[1287.5s] revelation 14 verse 8 haron\n[1290.8s] god has given us the third angel's\n[1292.6s] message\n[1293.9s] miriam\n[1295.3s] and it's so coincidence that cover\n[1297.0s] miriam\n[1298.4s] and ellen g white were both women they\n[1301.1s] were both ladies\n[1303.0s] it's very interesting because the rise\n[1305.0s] of the third angel 1844 ellen g white\n[1308.2s] is given the spirit of prophecy\n[1313.9s] miriam\n[1315.1s] but wait a minute\n[1331.8s] they were not the messengers that took\n[1334.3s] part in that very event\n[1337.1s] of of taking the children of israel\n[1340.6s] to the promised land it was joshua so\n[1343.0s] joshua comes in as the fourth message\n[1346.5s] and the fourth messenger revelation 18\n[1349.8s] is joshua the final attack on jericho i\n[1354.0s] the babylon that must fall\n[1356.5s] god's people must be prepared for that\n[1358.6s] final work it must begin in israel\n[1362.2s] israeli and joshua when joshua gets in\n[1365.4s] by the way\n[1367.5s] when joshua begins his work\n[1370.0s] jesus himself speaks\n[1372.2s] the bible says in the book of\n[1374.2s] deuteronomy chapter number one\n[1376.9s] deuteronomy chapter number one\n[1381.2s] deuteronomy chapter number one\n[1385.4s] bible says deuteronomy\n[1393.3s] the bible says in the autonomy\n[1396.8s] i and your money know most alien israeli\n[1399.0s] water and hamburghani these are the ones\n[1400.8s] that moses told the children of israel\n[1403.6s] on the other side of the show of jordan\n[1407.0s] and when moses had spoken those words of\n[1408.8s] course he brought up joshua to take\n[1411.0s] forth\n[1414.6s] the bible continues to say\n[1418.4s] joshua chapter number one\n[1423.8s] joshua was told to be strong\n[1427.4s] because the lord was going to be with\n[1429.7s] him\n[1431.2s] he should not fear\n[1433.6s] uh the the reproach\n[1436.0s] of the nations\n[1437.7s] and even the israelites that is\n[1439.0s] deuteronomy chapter one\n[1441.2s] deuteronomy chapter two\n[1443.8s] and\n[1445.1s] after that moses dies and when we begin\n[1447.6s] in the book of joshua we see the\n[1449.7s] instructions given to joshua as plain\n[1452.4s] and explicitly clear\n[1477.8s] i want you to take the children of\n[1479.8s] israel into the land of canaan the\n[1481.6s] fourth message\n[1483.3s] is the message that finishes the work\n[1486.1s] this is the ministry of joshua\n[1488.5s] the fourth angel revelation 18 that\n[1490.5s] causes the burden and god must select\n[1493.5s] leaders to guide his people\n[1498.6s] you must elect god's leaders\n[1501.9s] to guide these people back\n[1504.5s] to go forth into there\n[1506.3s] to the promised land\n[1508.5s] into the promised land\n[1511.3s] into the promised land now\n[1513.4s] revelation 18\n[1515.0s] is the manifestation of jesus jesus\n[1517.0s] himself\n[1519.1s] manifests himself in the latter rain so\n[1521.4s] the latter rain is the revelation\n[1527.1s] that is a message that the bible teaches\n[1529.3s] the latter rain is the manifestation of\n[1531.0s] jesus\n[1532.1s] rome takatifu when god pours forth his\n[1534.4s] spirit\n[1535.4s] he manifests he manifests\n[1538.8s] his son\n[1540.1s] christ jesus and his righteousness\n[1542.4s] to his people that they may be prepared\n[1544.4s] to stand\n[1545.6s] in the trials that come but wait a\n[1548.0s] minute\n[1552.3s] is it true\n[1553.5s] that jesus must come\n[1556.3s] to try to awaken people that slumber in\n[1558.9s] this in the ship\n[1560.6s] yes\n[1562.5s] and what is the purpose of the lottery\n[1565.4s] what is the purpose of the burden\n[1568.9s] remember\n[1578.1s] who shall speak\n[1579.8s] in behalf of israel\n[1583.0s] god and to intervene god had to show\n[1585.4s] openly through the body\n[1587.4s] that this is the leader the tribe of\n[1589.5s] levi i have chosen them\n[1592.2s] because aaron's road has muttered\n[1595.8s] let's go to matthew chapter 23\n[1598.9s] matthew chapter 23\n[1601.1s] jesus is the fourth messenger jesus is\n[1603.2s] associated with number four\n[1605.1s] remember the book of hosea says\n[1608.6s] that\n[1609.6s] hosea chapter 6 says\n[1611.6s] is going forth\n[1613.4s] is\n[1614.7s] as the morning and it shall come to us\n[1617.1s] as the rain as the as the latter rain\n[1620.5s] when jesus revealed himself\n[1622.3s] prophetically it is asked the morning\n[1625.1s] good morning\n[1626.6s] put that in your mind was this out here\n[1631.1s] matthew 23\n[1633.0s] versus number 14\n[1635.7s] matthew 23\n[1653.3s] 14 verse 23\n[1655.0s] matthew chapter 14\n[1657.0s] verses number 23\n[1659.4s] matthew chapter 14\n[1661.3s] verses number 23 the bible says\n[1666.2s] when he had bid farewell to the to the\n[1668.5s] multitudes ali panda murimani\n[1671.1s] faraga\n[1673.0s] nakuri\n[1674.3s] when it was evening\n[1680.7s] the ship was in the midst of the sea\n[1683.2s] those who are looking at this\n[1684.5s] prophetically we understand that the\n[1686.3s] sheep is is is refers to the church that\n[1690.2s] bears god's people\n[1703.3s] the winds were blowing contrary so the\n[1705.8s] ship was troubled in the midst of the\n[1707.4s] sea that is what is happening to\n[1709.5s] adventism\n[1710.9s] because the sheep is being tossed to and\n[1712.5s] fro\n[1713.7s] by every wind of doctrine\n[1715.9s] every weed of doctrine\n[1718.4s] the bible continues to say\n[1721.4s] in a sema\n[1722.7s] heart\n[1730.4s] in the fourth watch of the night jesus\n[1733.0s] revealed himself to them\n[1735.9s] in the fourth watch the bible is\n[1738.7s] specific\n[1739.8s] it was the fourth watch of the night\n[1742.4s] that jesus revealed himself and\n[1744.8s] manifested himself to his people that\n[1747.4s] were in the ship to try to bring back\n[1749.4s] their faith\n[1752.2s] they are being tossed to and fro\n[1755.0s] to and fro by the winds of false\n[1756.7s] doctrines\n[1757.9s] there is much to fear from within than\n[1759.8s] from without\n[1761.6s] there is much to fear from within the\n[1763.2s] doctrines\n[1764.7s] that are beating around god's people\n[1768.6s] many of them are from within god's\n[1770.6s] people\n[1771.4s] have lost an anchor\n[1774.2s] the bible is specific it was the fourth\n[1776.5s] watch of the night\n[1778.2s] that jesus manifested himself\n[1780.6s] now maybe we should ask the bible able\n[1782.6s] to listen bibilia what is the name given\n[1786.2s] to the fourth watch of the night\n[1791.1s] because jose chapter 6 verse 3 says when\n[1793.4s] jesus manifest himself to his people in\n[1795.5s] the latter end he's going forth is us\n[1798.8s] the morning\n[1801.2s] morning\n[1806.9s] now let's see what is the name given to\n[1809.3s] the fourth watch of the night\n[1812.2s] mark chapter 13 verse 35\n[1815.6s] mark chapter 13\n[1817.6s] verses number that five\n[1820.6s] mark chapter 13\n[1822.9s] verses number that five\n[1825.9s] we are reading from the book of mark\n[1829.1s] marico cominato\n[1835.4s] natano\n[1837.3s] listen very carefully\n[1839.2s] the bible says\n[1841.1s] the fourth watch of the night\n[1843.4s] has a name\n[1845.5s] mark chapter 13 verse at five\n[1849.4s] the bible says in mark 13 verse 35\n[1860.4s] this is not the second coming of jesus\n[1862.8s] this is the manifestation of jesus to\n[1864.6s] his people his house\n[1867.7s] the church\n[1882.3s] the four watches of the night let me\n[1884.3s] read in english\n[1887.2s] watch ye therefore for ye no not when\n[1890.1s] the ma when the master of the house\n[1891.9s] cometh\n[1893.0s] at even\n[1895.0s] at midnight\n[1896.8s] or at coke growing\n[1899.0s] or in the morning so the fourth watch of\n[1901.0s] the night is called the morning\n[1902.8s] so this is the time period prophetically\n[1904.9s] when jesus manifested\n[1906.6s] himself to his people in the lettering\n[1909.9s] hosea chapter six verse three\n[1912.4s] and he shall come to us as the latter in\n[1915.1s] his going forth is\n[1917.6s] us the morning\n[1919.2s] it is the morning prophetically\n[1922.2s] to begin to\n[1924.9s] we proceed\n[1928.5s] when jesus manifested his himself to the\n[1931.1s] people who were in the sheep\n[1933.6s] at\n[1935.9s] the fourth watch of the night\n[1937.9s] peter thought that they had seen a ghost\n[1941.6s] that is what they thought\n[1943.7s] the first fulfillment of when jesus\n[1947.6s] wanted to manifest himself to his people\n[1950.6s] the first fulfillment\n[1953.0s] occurred in 1888\n[1955.5s] let us see whether ellen white writes\n[1957.6s] the same\n[1958.6s] let's see whether he writes this the\n[1960.3s] very first attempt was in 1888\n[1964.3s] by the way\n[1965.5s] i'm just reading last day events page\n[1967.1s] 210\n[1968.2s] paragraph nine\n[1971.1s] last day events\n[1974.2s] last

paragraph 2.\n[2004.7s] she says\n[2006.9s] there is to be in the seventh day\n[2008.2s] adventist churches a wonderful\n[2009.8s] manifestation of the power of god\n[2012.9s] you see it is the power of god\n[2015.3s] so the holy spirit is the power of god\n[2019.0s] i hear so many arguments people say the\n[2021.3s] holy spirit cannot be the power of god\n[2023.6s] the holy spirit\n[2025.0s] is a separate person from the father\n[2027.5s] and from jesus is the third being\n[2030.5s] separate from the father and the son\n[2034.3s] that is what adventism believes that is\n[2036.2s] what the world teaches but that is not\n[2038.4s] what the bible and the spirit of\n[2039.6s] prophecy teaches\n[2041.6s] elenor says\n[2043.2s] there is to be in the seventh day\n[2045.0s] adventist churches a wonderful\n[2046.7s] manifestation of the power\n[2049.1s] of god\n[2051.0s] we can show this from the bible that the\n[2052.6s] holy spirit is the power of god we can\n[2054.2s] show it luke chapter 1 verse 35\n[2057.3s] it's the power of god so you cannot\n[2059.3s] separate the power of god\n[2061.1s] and put god aside and put his power\n[2063.8s] aside and say that is god\n[2066.1s] and that is another god no\n[2068.8s] i also have some power i can lift some\n[2071.0s] heavy some heavy gadget\n[2073.5s] can you separate my power from myself no\n[2075.8s] it cannot happen you need one\n[2078.0s] always\n[2081.2s] that is false that is deception of the\n[2085.0s] highest order and that is why satan has\n[2088.1s] brought in his deception\n[2090.5s] the last apostasy omega of apostasy that\n[2094.2s] began with the kellogg is here with us\n[2097.4s] and many adventists have never realized\n[2099.4s] that today luke chapter 1 verse 35\n[2101.8s] before i read last event\n[2103.6s] concerning the power of god\n[2105.4s] the holy spirit is\n[2107.4s] the power of god\n[2109.8s] luke chapter 1 verse 35\n[2112.9s] the holy spirit is not a third god\n[2115.1s] called god the holy spirit separate from\n[2117.8s] god separate from christ no no no no\n[2120.2s] even wrong\n[2122.2s] luke chapter 1 verse 35\n[2125.2s] luke chapter 1 verse 35\n[2128.2s] i'm just showing you i love in the\n[2129.4s] universe of kundalini\n[2131.0s] the bible's by the way it's very easy\n[2133.4s] the bible is very easy to understand\n[2137.9s] luke chapter 1 verse 35\n[2150.3s] and the angel told mary\n[2153.4s] that the holy spirit shall descend upon\n[2155.8s] thee and the power of the most high\n[2159.1s] shall be upon you so the holy spirit\n[2162.2s] is the power of the most high\n[2165.4s] now is there a possibility that the\n[2167.0s] power of the most high is a different\n[2168.5s] person from god or from christ himself\n[2172.2s] no that is not true\n[2174.1s] the power of god\n[2176.1s] who is the power of god\n[2177.8s] look at the book of first corinthians\n[2179.4s] chapter 1 verse 24\n[2182.0s] first corinthians chapter one\n[2186.4s] first corinthians\n[2190.2s] the bible says\n[2195.0s] who is the power of god we've seen\n[2198.2s] it's very interesting\n[2215.0s] so unto those who are called the jews\n[2217.2s] and the greeks it is christ\n[2219.5s] the power of god\n[2221.8s] so the latter name the holy spirit is\n[2223.6s] the manifestation of the power of god\n[2225.8s] christ jesus is the power of god and to\n[2228.1s] his people amen\n[2230.2s] the bible has has never been this clear\n[2232.5s] before bibili\n[2239.0s] that is a deception\n[2241.2s] last lastly events page 2 10 paragraph 1\n[2243.1s] the bible uh spiritual prophet says\n[2245.7s] there is to be in the seventh-day\n[2247.5s] adventist churches\n[2249.2s] a wonderful manifestation of the power\n[2251.7s] of god who is being manifested it is\n[2253.9s] christ himself the power of god but it\n[2256.8s] will not move upon those who have not\n[2258.4s] humbled themselves\n[2260.6s] before the lord and open the door of the\n[2262.8s] heart by confession and repentance\n[2265.0s] listen to this now\n[2266.9s] in the manifestation of that power which\n[2269.7s] lightens the earth with the glory of god\n[2273.0s] oh\n[2275.0s] so that power must lighten the earth\n[2277.8s] with the glory of god okay\n[2280.2s] put that in mind\n[2282.2s] they will see something which in their\n[2283.8s] blindness they will think dangerous\n[2286.2s] like villa me too\n[2289.6s] they they were in the ship when they saw\n[2291.6s] the manifestation of jesus in the fourth\n[2293.8s] hour fourth watch of the night they saw\n[2296.1s] something dangerous this is the history\n[2298.1s] of adventism 1888\n[2301.8s] something which will arouse their fears\n[2304.8s] and they will brace themselves to resist\n[2306.8s] it\n[2307.5s] because the law does not work in\n[2309.3s] accordance to their ideas and\n[2311.1s] expectations they will oppose the work\n[2314.7s] why they say should we not know the\n[2316.6s] spirit of god\n[2318.2s] when we have been in the work for so\n[2319.5s] many years\n[2320.9s] the third angel's message will not be\n[2323.0s] understood or comprehended the light\n[2325.4s] which will lighten the earth with the\n[2326.7s] glory of god will be called a false\n[2328.6s] light by those who refuse to walk in its\n[2331.8s] advancing glory\n[2333.8s] let us put things together

no\n[2701.8s] the only condition by which\n[2703.6s] that message and that power would be\n[2705.9s] upon god's people is a confession of sin\n[2709.1s] kutubudabi general conference

aaron's\n[3002.4s] road that he has selected a new\n[3004.1s] leadership for his people\n[3005.7s] in the times of the body let's go to\n[3007.7s] hagai\n[3010.8s] hagai\n[3012.8s] hagai\n[3014.1s] the book of haggai\n[3016.9s] chapter number two\n[3018.6s] hagiai\n[3020.6s] the book of hagiai\n[3023.7s] hagiai chapter number two it depends on\n[3026.7s] where you come from some people say hey\n[3030.1s] some people say haggai\n[3033.4s] hagai chapter 2\n[3036.4s] the bible says\n[3039.0s] that the lord will suddenly come to his\n[3041.9s] temple\n[3044.6s] but who shall stand\n[3046.5s] because when he cometh to his temple\n[3049.4s] he is like a refiner he separates two\n[3052.2s] classes of worshippers whether we are\n[3053.8s] conscious\n[3055.1s] or whether we are not conscious\n[3056.5s] depending on whether we have received\n[3058.6s] the light or whether we have rejected\n[3061.0s] the light of the budding\n[3063.0s] the burden forth\n[3065.4s] the very message\n[3067.0s] that jesus wants us to understand\n[3070.0s] in these last days\n[3073.0s] again chapter 2\n[3077.7s] this is a message\n[3079.4s] that is very key\n[3106.4s] speak unto the remnant\n[3108.5s] of the children of israel saying\n[3115.3s] amongst you who is left that saw this\n[3118.5s] house in its initial glory\n[3122.4s] adventism we are living in 2022. who saw\n[3125.5s] adventism in 1840 1844\n[3128.6s] who saw it 1840-1844\n[3131.0s] is there anyone amongst us was there\n[3133.4s] alive no\n[3135.6s] we are the children\n[3137.0s] of our father's faith\n[3142.2s] israel who saw this house in its initial\n[3145.5s] glory it was just powerful\n[3149.8s] when god had laid the foundational\n[3151.5s] truths\n[3156.2s] and how do you see today we're going to\n[3158.5s] answer the questions as we progress\n[3162.7s] be a strong serum\n[3172.4s] why is it that the lord is saying that\n[3174.8s] they should be strong\n[3176.4s] i'm reading verse 8.\n[3179.2s] it says\n[3180.5s] look at this\n[3182.2s] versus number seven\n[3184.8s] god will do something\n[3187.5s] in israel when the burden begins\n[3191.2s] when the prophecy of psalms chapter 132\n[3193.2s] begins to fulfill\n[3194.7s] when when the burden when that horn\n[3197.5s] wakati pembe\n[3201.8s] israeli maria\n[3203.2s] this is the first time\n[3205.2s] before jesus comes back in revelation\n[3207.3s] chapter 18 in the manifestation of that\n[3209.8s] power of god the very first time is when\n[3212.6s] jesus is born in bethlehem and is raised\n[3215.2s] amongst his people and goes to his\n[3217.2s] temple physically\n[3219.4s] to his temple this is the very first\n[3221.2s] time of the fulfillment of the prophecy\n[3223.3s] of malachi chapter 3 and haggai chapter\n[3225.4s] 2. the bible says\n[3238.6s] the bible says and i will shake the the\n[3241.4s] entire world the nations\n[3243.7s] and the desire of nation shall come\n[3246.6s] and i will fill this house with the\n[3248.6s] glory of god amen\n[3251.6s] the desire of ages is jesus before he\n[3254.0s] comes there must be a shaking of the\n[3255.9s] entire earth the message of his coming\n[3258.5s] must shake the earth and that is why in\n[3260.6s] the times of herod wakati herod\n[3265.1s] the whole of jerusalem was troubled with\n[3267.2s] the message because the message was\n[3269.0s] coming from the east\n[3271.1s] and the magaya\n[3272.8s] uh\n[3280.6s] they did not know the time of their\n[3282.2s] visitation\n[3283.4s] they did not know that god is coming to\n[3285.4s] take his work\n[3286.8s] to another level\n[3290.0s] two classes of worshippers will develop\n[3293.0s] those who will continue to stand firm in\n[3296.1s] the platform that jesus stood pla farm\n[3298.7s] for\n[3300.3s] because jesus was the foundation of the\n[3302.8s] jewish economy yes\n[3310.4s] so jesus was coming back\n[3313.5s] to manifest himself for the very first\n[3315.4s] time and this is the purpose of the\n[3316.8s] lettering even in the last days look at\n[3319.0s] what spirit of prophet says\n[3325.6s] she says\n[3327.3s] look at this\n[3334.2s] it says in the book called\n[3336.9s] let me let me see this book\n[3340.0s] uh\n[3342.5s] i want to show you what jesus came to do\n[3345.6s] his his very own revelation\n[3356.2s] she says\n[3357.4s] desire of ages\n[3359.1s] page 288\n[3361.2s] listen very carefully\n[3364.7s] desire of ages\n[3366.8s] chapter 29\n[3368.6s] this is page 218 888\n[3372.2s] she says\n[3374.1s] the savior had not come to set aside\n[3376.3s] what the patriarchs and the prophets had\n[3378.2s] spoken that was the foundation\n[3381.3s] for he himself had spoken through these\n[3383.3s] representative men\n[3385.4s] all the truths of god's word came forth\n[3388.7s] from him but these priceless gems had\n[3392.7s] been placed in false settings\n[3410.2s] their precious light had been made to\n[3412.4s] minister to era\n[3414.0s] while coming\n[3416.2s] by you'll see your moonwale\n[3418.2s] god desired them to be removed from\n[3420.9s] their settings of error\n[3425.1s] he had desired that israel be removed\n[3428.8s] from their setting of error and\n[3439.8s] and had replaced them\n[3441.9s] with the framework\n[3443.4s] he came to replace those errors\n[3445.8s] in the framework of truth\n[3448.0s] this work only a divine hand could\n[3451.1s] accomplish\n[3452.4s] by its connection with the error the\n[3454.5s] truth had been serving the cause of the\n[3456.4s] enemy god and of god and man\n[3459.4s] christ had come to place it where it\n[3461.7s] would glorify god and work the salvation\n[3464.8s] of humanity amen\n[3469.3s] eras\n[3474.2s] that is the very essence of the\n[3475.8s] lettering because the latter rain is the\n[3477.8s] manifestation of jesus when jesus begins\n[3480.6s] to bring the truth\n[3482.4s] the leaders cannot accept the truth\n[3485.2s] because\n[3486.6s] the foundational truth thou\n[3488.8s] jesus must begin another work he must\n[3491.2s] begin a new work and let the blind\n[3494.9s] leaders the blind guides to continue to\n[3497.8s] think that they are the temple of god\n[3500.0s] yes what our channel\n[3508.6s] they rejected the truth the sun henry\n[3512.0s] that is the history of the lattering it\n[3514.6s] begins with the fss\n[3516.6s] it goes forward to philadelphia\n[3521.8s] by the way these three churches are very\n[3523.8s] important when we study the history of\n[3525.8s] the birding of aaron's road la zima to\n[3528.6s] do history\n[3543.0s] revelation chapter 18 he's only saying\n[3545.0s] that the manifestation of the character\n[3547.1s] of god to set back the foundational\n[3549.5s] truths and to begin a work\n[3552.6s] that many people will not understand let\n[3554.8s] us let us read desire of aegis 232.\n[3558.8s] when the latter rain begins\n[3561.0s] jesus must take a new direction look at\n[3563.8s] what happens\n[3565.0s] in in israel when jesus manifestation\n[3567.9s] manifested manifested the glory of god\n[3571.8s] when he manifested the glory of god\n[3574.6s] okay\n[3575.9s] look at what happened\n[3578.2s] look at what happened\n[3580.6s] these are wages\n[3584.4s] deserve ages\n[3588.2s] desired of ages page 232.\n[3593.0s] without wages\n[3601.7s] page 200\n[3604.2s] and number 32\n[3607.0s] listen\n[3608.4s] let's give zuri 232 paragraph one she\n[3610.6s] says\n[3614.5s] she says\n[3616.3s] if the leaders in israel had received\n[3618.3s] christ\n[3619.3s] he would have honored them as his\n[3620.8s] messengers to carry the gospel to the\n[3622.4s] world at assassination allowed to cry\n[3625.3s] we must have the burden jesus must be\n[3627.4s] manifested again to his people fast\n[3631.1s] fast\n[3632.6s] but the message first goes to the\n[3634.5s] leaders in israel\n[3636.8s] if they had accepted christ if they had\n[3639.4s] accepted the glory of god if they had\n[3642.5s] accepted the angel of revelation 18\n[3646.3s] in a nutshell\n[3648.3s] she says\n[3650.2s] god would have honored them as his\n[3652.0s] people\n[3653.2s] to take the gospel to the world\n[3656.6s] she says\n[3658.3s] to them first was given the opportunity\n[3660.2s] to become heralds of the kingdom of\n[3661.8s] grace of god\n[3663.4s] but israel knew not the time of her\n[3667.0s] visitation\n[3668.4s] the jealousy and distrust of the jewish\n[3671.8s] leaders had ripened into open hatred\n[3676.1s] and the hearts of the people were turned\n[3678.2s] away from jesus so the leaders had the\n[3680.5s] problem they did not want to go back to\n[3682.7s] their foundational truths\n[3684.4s] they do not want to accept the message\n[3686.0s] that jesus had brought\n[3687.7s] up\n[3695.1s] that is the purpose of the\n[3697.8s] to to put aside error and to cause the\n[3700.6s] people of god to stand on the platform\n[3702.5s] of eternal truth\n[3704.6s] look at what happened sikhi aquititum\n[3708.5s] the sun henry\n[3710.9s] had rejected christ's message\n[3713.4s] and was bent upon his death walitaka\n[3717.0s] okay\n[3718.2s] therefore jesus departed from jerusalem\n[3723.2s] muji\n[3724.3s] from the priests vyongoziwadini\n[3727.8s] from the temple mariam bapu mung\n[3729.8s] gariquanaka the religious leaders the\n[3733.0s] people who had been instructed in the\n[3734.8s] law and returned to another class to\n[3738.4s] proclaim his message\n[3741.1s] god had begun to collect a people\n[3745.4s] that he can use to take his message\n[3748.4s] while the leaders continued to think\n[3751.0s] that they were still god's chosen\n[3752.7s] messengers what a deception\n[3755.7s] what a deception\n[3758.1s] jesus went to gather out those who\n[3760.2s] should carry the gospel to all nations\n[3762.2s] listen now\n[3763.4s] as we bring this for close listen very\n[3765.1s] closely\n[3766.2s] as the light and life of man was\n[3768.8s] rejected\n[3770.6s] jesus is the light\n[3772.2s] and the life of men\n[3773.6s] the holy spirit gives the life of jesus\n[3776.3s] so the holy spirit again is the life of\n[3778.8s] christ it is not god the holy spirit\n[3781.4s] somebody separate and distinct from\n[3783.2s] jesus it is the very life and the very\n[3785.6s] nature of jesus himself that is what the\n[3787.8s] spiritual prophet says\n[3791.8s] yes\n[3792.8s] as the light and life of man was\n[3795.3s] rejected\n[3796.6s] by the ecclesiastical authorities in the\n[3799.0s] days of christ so it has been rejected\n[3802.6s] in every succeeding generation tuna be\n[3805.8s] upper\n[3822.7s] again and again the history of christ's\n[3825.3s] withdrawal from judea has been repeated\n[3828.8s] when the reformers preach the word of\n[3830.6s] god the foundational truth because the\n[3833.2s] reformers have accepted that jesus is\n[3836.4s] the foundation they have accepted not\n[3839.8s] error but the truth they have accepted\n[3842.6s] to return the people back to the\n[3844.1s] platform of eternal truth\n[3847.4s] they had no thought of separating\n[3849.0s] themselves from the established church\n[3879.0s] leaders would not tolerate the light and\n[3881.1s] those who had the light were forced to\n[3883.2s] seek another class who are longing for\n[3885.4s] the truth in our day\n[3887.5s] few of the prophets followers of the\n[3889.4s] reformers are actuated by their own\n[3891.6s] spirit few are listening for the voice\n[3895.0s] of god are ready and ready to accept the\n[3897.8s] truth and whatsoever guys it may be\n[3900.6s] presented\n[3903.0s] in reformers\n[3905.0s] conference churches ambassador\n[3913.5s] our next topic will be tackling what is\n[3916.6s] the church canis aninini\n[3919.8s] is the general conference they church\n[3922.3s] we will begin by tackling the history of\n[3924.2s] the latter rain and the fourth angel\n[3926.9s] and we are going to understand what the\n[3928.6s] church is and how god is to finish the\n[3931.4s] work in the last days\n[3933.5s] what would you want to say\n[3959.4s] jesus sought another class he left the\n[3962.2s] priest he left jerusalem he left the\n[3965.0s] temple he left the religious leaders\n[3967.5s] matthew chapter 13 verse 15.\n[3969.9s] yes\n[3976.8s] i kept\n[3979.7s] let them alone\n[3981.0s] that is matthew chapter 15 verse 13.\n[3985.8s] iron throat that burden\n[3988.0s] we have seen so far\n[3989.9s] that when jesus manifest himself\n[3992.6s] he manifests himself in the holy spirit\n[3994.4s] to reveal the glory of god to his people\n[3996.7s] so that god's people may be established\n[3999.8s] in their foundational truths\n[4005.3s] when we come to part three\n[4007.1s] we are going to move forward to 1888\n[4010.2s] from 1888 2022 where is the fourth angel\n[4014.7s] has jesus manifested himself to us today\n[4018.7s] is the work of god taking a different\n[4020.2s] dimension\n[4022.7s] what work\n[4024.0s] are we supposed to support in the last\n[4025.7s] days\n[4048.6s] how will we know that the work of god\n[4051.3s] has taken a different dimension god\n[4053.2s] bless you\n[4101.1s] amina"

on the on the on the on the tray as you can see and then after that we we smashed using a fork it's smash until it become so tender smash smash until all the avocado is smashed yes and we told that this can make for us very good avocado oil which can be used for facial for hair care and the Skin Care General and also for cooking yes instead of going for the refined oils you can easily make avocado oil as simple as this just take your avocados wash them nicely scoop and put on a tray then smash well after the Smashing you're going to put the we going to put the smash I smashed avocado in a tray in direct sunlight that it can dry up then we we be Che checking it and turning it occasionally C all the avocado is dried up then from there we come back for the next step which should be to squeeze off the oil from the our dried avocado so this is now our product of the smashed Avocado now going to put it on the sun to to dry yes then be turning it occasionally yes these are first these are our trial so we don't know how the outcome be but just try maybe our second our our second attempt will be better but let's look out for the outcome of this first attempt we hope that it will be okay and we're going to enjoy our avocado oil yes after that you're going to take it to the Sun to dry yes looking for sunlight is not so but we hope yes that's yes now now our avocado is dry we'll come back to check on it after some few you can turn it and see the outcome thank you good afternoon everyone yeah today we are on our dat two of drying our avocado to make our avocado oil we're still on the drying process just on the trial stage still we not fully sure of of the outcome this still our trial stage today the second day we did the avocado uh the we did the washing and the Smashing avocado yesterday we did our first drying yesterday but it didn't dry up well because there was no sun light now sunlight but today God God has been faithful to us we have some sun now the avocado is drying drying out well as you can see from the pan we have some deposits little deposits of oil on our pan which means you're going to have nice avocado oil when we get to the when you get our end result yes let's just be patient enough I know by the end of this you're going to have nice avocado oil yeah let's wait let's keep it on the sun again so that we can get our final result maybe yesterday in case we get enough sunlight tomorrow we will get our final product okay thank you hi everyone welcome back to our simple avocado oil extraction this is our day three you can see the outcome of what you were drying all the moisture is gone now we left with just some black substance of avocado let's see our next step is will not be now to squeeze off the oil from this product that we have here I'm not so sure of it yet cuz it's a it's our first trial but I'm sure the consequent consequent uh ones should be a bit sucessful so we're going to use a cheese cloth or a sheer cloth and um somewhere where we can extract the oil into a dish or something then you scoop our avocados little by little [Music] yes we hopeful to get as much oil as possible from our little trial

earth's history india in this third part we are going to look at the second coming of christ in the history we are not talking of the second appearing of jesus in the clouds of heaven that glorious appearance is uh or rain is the manifestation of christ and his righteousness to his own people and uh the book of malacca malachi to ambition john the baptist is the messenger that prepares the way for the manifestation of christ to his people yes yes it is because of the burden the burden is the revelation of jesus nick chapter 27 verses number six isaiah chapter 27 verses number six museum the birding king james version i saw 27 versus number six the prophetic parallels of the bible you can never understand what kind of work is taking place right now in this art history what's it called isaiah 27 6 the bible says he shall cause them that come of jacob to take root israel shall blossom and bird and fill the face of the whole world with the fruit israeli itachi the horn of salvation samsung 32-17 allah psalms 132 verses number 17 psalms 132 verses number 17. there will i make the horn of david too bad i have ordained a lamp for my mind anointed is the messenger that is to prepare the way for the burden in israel yes amen we have that wonderful topic that is called in his temple when jesus arrived physically for the very first time for the very first time to bring light now the purpose of jesus coming to israel was to put down errors the rubbish of errors that have been heaping for generations and to replace back the truth in the framework of truth singing but what happened the leaders in israel could not tolerate the light and we are told in the pain of inspiration dessert of ages page 200 and 32 desire of ages page 200 and 332 and i say maybe listen carefully this is history that repeats in every succeeding generations whenever jesus will be revealed again yes because right now we are going to the military to see when the birding began again wakati machipu the same history was being repeated she says if the leaders in his israel had received christ he would have honored them as his messengers to carry the gospel to the world to them first was given the opportunity to become heralds of the kingdom of grace of god but israel knew not the time of her visitation the jealousy and distrust of the jewish leaders had opened it ripened had ripened into open hatred at the hearts of the people were turned away from jesus the sun henry yong goziwadini kosovo they had rejected christ's message and was bent upon his death therefore shikaya points to india we are taught therefore jesus departed from jerusalem jesus the presence of jesus was no longer in jerusalem he departed from jerusalem number one number two from the priests young ghost wadding number three from the temple hekalo number four the religious leaders the people who had been instructed in the law and turned to another class to proclaim his message and to gather out those who should carry the gospel to all nations luke chapter 6 verse 12. they have rejected the foundation of the jewish economy jesus was the foundation jesus came to bring back the truth to those who would have accepted them like anyway pinga luke chapter six versus number twelve lucas emma lucas coomba aka kesha we have the title of the of a wonderful topic that is called the ordained twelfth jesus began to obtain the twelve to establish his church what we had the religious leaders the temple services and jesus began to ordain a ministry to carry for the work those who would accept his message remember those who accepted the message of john the baptist accepted christ those who accepted the second message with christ as the light and life of man was rejected by the ecclesiastical authorities in the day in the days of christ so it has been rejected in every succeeding generation again and again the history of christ withdrawal from judea has been repeated they had no thought of separating themselves from the established but the religious leaders would not tolerate the light and those who had the light were forced to seek another class who were longing for the truth in our day few of the professed followers of the reformers are actuated by the spirit in a minute the bible says history must repeat and the pain of inspiration says that history of jesus withdrawing from judea will be repeated to the close of time now let's go to the second history to megalith of israel we will be revisiting that history as we move forward now let's go back to malachi chapter three to angola yes by the way malachi says the lord whom you suddenly seek shall come to his temple the first temple was in jerusalem now we are looking at the second temple before we look at the second temple maybe let's look at the book of joel chapter 2 verse 23 it will form the basis of understanding how many times rain has fallen in the uh in this earth history before jesus returns back for his people joel chapter 2 verse 23 joel chapter 2 joel chapter 2 and rejoice in the lord your god for he had given you the former reign moderately at me only and he will cause to calm down for you the rain involved the rain the rain the the former rain the rain of the latter the former rain the rain and the la terrain is three let us repeat the book of malachi we want to establish the three reigns in the history the first one begins at pentecost the last one is in our time period in the time period of revelation 18 the loud cry of the third angel where we repeat again the bible says behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me jesus speaking and the lord whom you will and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in behold he shall come save the lord of hosts but who may abide in the day of his coming and you shall stand when he appear it for he is like the refiners fire and like the fuller soap and they shall sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold silver that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness jesus will begin to separate two classes of worshippers depending on those who have accepted the whole truth their foundational truths or those who have rejected two classes of worshippers now when does this happen then a second time we go to the history of the philadelphian church revelation chapter 10 the second time that jesus appears to his people yes philadelphia is the great advent millerite movement and i want to show you from the pane of inspiration great controversy you read first the book of great controversy she says great controversy great controversy great controversy she says she she she merges three histories and a letter is to riha tatu zawat to a she says great controversy 6 11. great under the topic the final warning abusive villain if you cannot understand the prophetic parallels you will never understand god's work in the last days that is why there's a lot of trouble in adventism today or people have failed to understand the prophetic parallels of the bible and the spirit of prophecy look at this listen very carefully she says great controversy 6 11. the angel who unites in the proclamation of the third angel's message is to lighten the art with his glory future revelation 18 revelation 18 the final outpouring of the holy spirit in the lottery she begins with that final movement a work of worldwide extent and unwanted power is here for told also listen to where she goes next secure my liana power and elia go to formula and i say maybe the advent movement of 1840 to 1844 was a glorious manifestation of the power of god the first angel's message was carried to every missionary station in the world and in some countries there were the greatest religious interests which has been witnessed in any land since the reformation of the 16th century but these are to be far exceeded by the mighty movement by the mighty movement under the last warning of the third angel there is to be a mighty movement and at the last warning amazon at the mighty movement revelation 18 and rudy 18 40 to 1844. there was also a glorious manifestation of the power of god the holy spirit was powered the ring now she goes back now the work will be similar to that of the day of pentecost full stop case closed revelation 18 1842 1844 pentecost joel chapter 2 verse 23 the lord has given us for moraine pentecost the reign 1840-1844 the latter rain revelation chapter 18 three histories joel chapter 2 verse 23 now we had finished or we that we had accomplished to show how there was a separation of classes when jesus manifested himself fast in the jewish time period to memories that led to pentecost now we are moving on to the second history the reign revelation chapter 10 verse 1. as we continue to tackle this subject the budding of aaron's road and the remnant part three we go to the second history tonight revelation chapter 10 verses number one eighteen forty to eighteen forty four revelation chapter ten tonight revelation eight uh ten eighteen forty twenty two vote forty four in a foreign revelation chapter 18 will be the same relationship to 10 verses number one economical the bible says the angel descends from heaven a rainbow is above his head and his face shineth as the as the sun the bible says and in his hand he had a little book open and when he had cried the seven thunders uttered their voices now who is this angel uh and the bible says the bible is specific in asema there is a rainbow and the sun the rainbow and the sun what else that does does not miss there was rain in this time period the angel's face is like the sun matthew chapter 17 verses number one matthew chapter 17 verses number one matthew chapter 17 verses number one the bible says in matthew 17 15 as the sun that is jesus the bible says in revelation chapter 10 that he had a a rainbow over his head that is jesus jesus was sin and his feet as the pillars of fire let us go to revelation chapter 1 verse 12 revelation chapter 1 verse 12 just to show that this is jesus jesus himself descended not physically of course it was the power of god and this is another instant that we see the holy spirit manifestation it is jesus himself the holy spirit is not a third god called god the holy spirit it is the manifestation of christ jesus himself to his people and we are going to show this again for those who believe that there is there is another god yes that is deception of the highest order i'm going to show again the bible says in revelation chapter 1 verses number 12 revelation chapter 1 verses number 12 revelation 1 verse 12 to see the voice that speak with me john says when john saw jesus his feet were asked the burning furnace that is revelation chapter 10 the angel that descended his feet were as pillars of fire that furnace that burnt that was jesus himself and spiritual prophecy also shows that it was christ it was the manifestation of jesus great controversy 6 11 says the advent movement of 1840 to 1844 was a glorious manifestation of the power of god so jesus descending is the power of god the power of god is the holy ghost luke chapter 1 verses number 35. it is the power of god and it is jesus manifesting himself therein when the angel came to to to to mary wakati malayaca it shall be called the son of god so jesus came down the spirit of prophecy also confirms bible commentary volume 7. bible commentary uh we can also read last day events uh commenting on revelation chapter 10 verses 5. bible commentary volume 7 7 bc you can read pages 972 paragraph 1 she says the mighty angel who instructed john was no less a personage than jesus christ setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot upon the dry line it shows the part which he is acting in the closing scenes of the great controversy with satan this position denotes his supreme power and authority over the old earth so it was jesus who descended okay yes in that movement having that little book of daniel abaya kofunua now revelation chapter 10 is very interesting listen very carefully remember malachi chapter 3 says before the messenger of the covenant is revealed there is always a messenger that is to prepare the people listen grace controversy let us see great controversy again very carefully in that history what happened uh we can read these from spiritual gifts vol 1 page 233 when that angel descended and william miller began to preach the first angels message wakati william miller alianza copianos because he was the messenger of the messenger that was prepared the people mila took the position of john the baptist listen very carefully schizophrenia is about she says i saw that god was in the proclamation of the time in 1843 it was designed it was his design to arouse the people and bring them to a testing point where they should decide for or against the truth listen very carefully in the time of jesus wakati movement people had to decide for or against the truth two classes of worshippers look at the times of miller himself god had designed that that movement be raised when jesus descended august 11 1840 wakati there was rain listen very carefully listen very carefully listen very carefully i wanted to listen very carefully what happened she continued saying ministers laid aside their secretarian sectarian views and feelings and united in proclaiming the coming of jesus wherever the message was given it moved the people sinners repented wept and prayed for forgiveness and those who survived lives had been marked with dishonesty were anxious to make restitutions parents felt the deepest solicitude for their children those who received the message labored with their unconverted for their unconverted friends and relatives and with their souls bowed with the weight of the solemn message warned and entreated them to prepare for the coming of the son of man those cases were most hardened that would not yield to such a weight of evidence set home by heartfelt warnings anasema one led to embrace the truth preached by miller william and servants of god who are raised up in the spirit and power of elijah to proclaim the message like john the forerunner of jesus those who preached this holy message felt compelled to lay the axe at the root of the tree and call upon men to bring forth fruits meat for repentance [Music] movement i'm buying it with the great advent nailerite movement full stop able to anglia kamakuna two classes of worshippers and they embraced the truth that miller and his associates were proclaiming in the time period of 1840 to 1844. abu tahangali what led to the movement of 1840-1844 look at this uh great controversy great controversy uh great controversy page 335 controversy page 335 she says in the year 1840 another remarkable fulfillment of prophecy excited a widespread interest two years before miya kamivili kabbalah josiah leach one of the leading ministers preaching the second advent published an exposition of revelation chapter nine predicting the fall of the ottoman empire and specifying not only the year but the very day on which this would take place according to his exposition management accounting the ottoman empire italian goku according to his exposition which was purely a matter of calculation and on the prophetic periods of scripture the turkish government would surrender its independence on the eleventh day of august 1840. chica your point 11 of august 1840 the prediction was widely published and thousands watched the course of events with eager interest at the very time specified turkey through her ambassadors accepted the protection of the allied powers of europe and thus placed herself under the control of christian nations uni great controversy tonight the event exactly fulfilled the prediction when it became known multitudes were convinced of the correctness of the prophetic principles in term of interpretation adopted by miller and his associates and a wonderful power a wonderful impetus was given to the advent movement men of learning and position united with miller both in preaching and publishing his views and from 1840 to 1844 the work rapidly extended william miller possessed a strong mental power governing eighteen forty to eighteen forty four able to anglican yesterday there was a separation of classes of when jesus left the temple the synagogue the priests the people he began a ministry a movement a movement that was to be free of errors a movement that was to be free from human dogmas to to prepare the people for the ali rain pentecost look at what happened during the times of of william was it a history repeat yes it says great controversy page 375 paragraph one grace controversy we are reading the book great controversy uh let me begin by great controversy three eight point one she says listen carefully she says great controversy 379 and 380 paragraph number three 379.3 great controversy search for the blessed results experienced by those who accepted the advent message they came from different denominations and their denominational barriers were held instead of following the truth people will be clinging to their denomination and their denominational dogmas while the voice is crying into the wilderness a voice will be crying into the wild from the wilderness to prepare way for the second coming of christ people will be leaving their denominations to join the remnant to stand in the platform of eternal truth we'll come to part 4 and 5 of the same message listen very carefully they came from different denominations and the denominational barriers were held to the ground conflicting creeds were shivered to atoms creed the unscriptural hope of the temporal millennium was abandoned false views of the second advents were corrected pride conformity to the world was swept away wrongs were made right hearts were united in swedish fellowship and love and joy reigned supreme in this doctrine did this if this doctrine did this for the few who did receive it it would have done the same for all if if all had received it but the churches generally did not accept the warning mechanism unto the house of israel should have been the first to decide to discern the tokens of jesus's coming had failed to learn the truth either from the testimony of the prophets or from the signs of the times ativiangosiwadini they had failed to learn the truth either from the testimony of the prophets or from the signs of the times as worldly hopes and ambitions filled the hearts love for god and faith in his word had grown cold and when the advent doctrines was was presented it only arouse their prejudice and unbelief because god was bringing back the foundational truths god was bringing additional light mongolian letters the fact that the message was to a great extent preached by laymen was argued as an instrument against it preachers see your theologians go preachers in every part of god's history god's work lay men are always the people that have been chosen of god to carry the message they are not proud when the message comes they will accept it they have no certificates to show that they have studied were the ones that were used by god to proclaim the message in the times of miller and layman they had accepted the message the times of jesus it was the same it was the same jesus told the pharisees that i tell you uh let me read matthew chapter 8 matthew 8. matthew chapter number eight let me see the bible says uh what says number matthew chapter 8 verses number 11. she says speaking of the centurion of bible says i say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of truth at one hour to point a wakati what wenge why she says the bible says uh because they have they had accepted the truth readily let me read in uh matthew yes yes chapter 11 from verse 16 but i but where and too shall i liken this generation nitapan anisha kizaziki nanini it is like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling unto their fellows and saying we have piped unto you and you have not danced we have moaned unto you and you have not lamented verse 18. for john came neither eating and drinking and they say he had the devil i only wanted me the son of man came neither eating nor drinking they came eating and drinking and they said behold a man glut on us and one bible and a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified in our children she says ah verse 25 and at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou has heed these things from the wise and the prudent and has revealed them unto babes on a masters in theology nikon a doctorate in philosophy in in in in religion because of their their their wisdom they want to embarrass the fact that this message was to a greater extent preached by laymen was an argument against it you'll see jimbo queen and so it will be today in the times of miller when that angel descended when there was rain the first angels message again there was a separation of worshippers those who took the message the bible says revelation chapter 10 verse 10. shall that message was sweet god was gathering a people to give the message in the last days and now to napoleon de leon that is the history that must repeat illinois says again and again the history of christ withdrawal from judea has been repeated when the reformers we must understand that history very well so that we may be able to stand on the platform of truth on the platform of eternal truth we have established that there was rain in the time of the milarites in the time of the milorites we have established to me the angel the messenger of the covenant was christ himself descended william miller took the position of john the baptist again and now as we progress i want to show that the different denominations did not accept the message of miller the different denominations we are reading tuna summer uh kitab we need to uh uh live sketches this is live sketches of james white and ellen g white live sketches of ellen white ls page 27 the advent course in portland maine in june of 1842 mr miller gave his second course of lectures at the casco street church in portland i felt it a great privilege this is ellen white to attend these lectures because people who are coming out of the various denominations we're going to finish our creeds we're going to talk about water william put these things in mind even as we move with history because the same history is going to repeat again she says for i had fallen under discouragement i did not prepare to meet my savior this second course created much more excitement in the city than the first with few exceptions the different denominations closed the doors of their churches against miller did not do that mila went to seek for another class who would obey the truth and he established places of worship what like in the times of jesus she says in desire of ages 232 paragraph 1 that when jesus left the temple the religious leaders a people in whom was given the message he went to another class those who rejoiced in the truth yes self-supporting ministries independent churches on assembly offices they don't even they they don't even understand the definition of a church people think that their denominations made that is a fatal deception even the jewish nation the jewish leaders by the way jesus left the structures jesus left the priest jesus left the temple and jesus went to another class how do you define the church is the church the structure is the church the denominational priests no the church cannot be those who have rejected the truth the church is always and will always be those who advance in the light and those who remain in their foundational truths those who follow the light where it is that is always the church that is the church manuscript releases volume 17. listen to this nissan general conference okay general conferences are posterized and small the church is not babylon which church which church is not babylon is it the general conference that is uniting with the prophecy that is that has formed a new organization do you still call that the church or what is your definition of a church what is your definition of a church because the church cannot fall the the church will remain there are tears and wheat in the near compare tears and wheat has has to do with apostasy tears and weeds has to do with sins not up not open apostasy open up posters apostasy has nothing to do with the tears and wheat being in the church tears and wheat have nothing to do with tears and wheat have nothing to do with open apostasy tears and wheat only tears and wheat have nothing to do with open apostasy tears and wheat have to do with scenes character nashanga watch on a quote spiritual prophecy i am afraid there are tears and wheat in the church which church what is the definition of a church is the church that group of people in open apostasy from their truth or is the church the group of individuals who have accepted to follow on the lord and to remain in their foundational truths amidst them they are wheat and tears 17 mr these are the things we are going to put in record straight as we continue with this presentation it is no that is not true 17 mr 81.4 she says god has a church in the last days god has a church it is not the great cathedral neither is it the various denominations canis it is the people who love god and keep his commandments where two or three are gathered together in my name there i am in the midst of them where christ is even among us the humble few this is christ's church for the presence of the high and the lofty one alone that inhabited eternity can alone constitute a chat you can see me quest why do you even have as we move forward to look at the last history in our time period we are going to look carefully because aaron's road is too bad in the time period when jesus is still in the most holy place by the way listen very carefully as we bring this rock to a close revelation chapter 10 and revelation chapter 18 is the same angel by the way revelation chapter 10 and revelation chapter 18 is the same angel revelation chapter 10 and revelation chapter 18 they are both mighty angels revelation chapter 10 the mighty angel revelation chapter 18 the mighty angel revelation chapter 10 the revelation chapter 18 that mighty angel cries with a loud voice it is the manifestation of christ himself now as we come to our time period look at this something that adventists many adventists have never realized that when the latter end begins in our time period we go back to malachi chapter 3 that the messenger of the covenant must prepare people to to for the revelation of jesus to come suddenly to his temple maybe as we introduce revelation chapter 18 we have seen that the very first attempt when god attempted to bring revelation chapter 18 the latter in loud cry was in 1888 that is the final time their final attempt their final work of god revelation 18 when that work begins two classes of worshippers again there are those who will establish themselves in the in their foundational truths they are those who are going to reject they are those who are going to stick to their denominations they are those who are going to follow christ the voice that will be crying the wilderness there are those who are going to be establishing god's people in the foundational truths there are those who are going to reject their truths two classes of worshipers you must understand where you belong when that work begins officially by the way israel is let us go to jeremiah chapter 3 and see how this happened jeremiah number fifteen when aaron's road budded god declared plainly the kind of leaders that he had chosen himself jeremiah chapter three verses number thirteen jeremiah chapter 3 jeremiah chapter 3 verses number 13 jeremiah 3 verses number 13 jeremiah chapter 3 verses number 10 the bible says so and repent and accept that thou has apostasized children that have apostasized this is a plea that god is saying that is the first message that god gives his children those who have apostasized from the truth that is was what israel had done returning return eo backsliding children listen very carefully to um let me read in english jeremiah chapter 3 verse 15 this is prophetic jeremiah 3 verse 15 jeremiah chapter 3 verse 15 says verse 14 turn over sliding children say the lord for i am married unto you and i will take you one of a city and two of a family and i will bring you unto zion verse 15 and i will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding this is prophetic there is a time period in history when god brings pastors whom he has chosen himself when the burden begins god chooses leaders those who have rejected the truth they will never know when god is choosing leaders to direct his people they will never understand when miller began his work and when god began to bring people out of the denomination of churches when people began to preach the first angels message when god began to establish leaders to feed people with the present truth the churches did not know the pharisees did not know and so it will be today the churches will not know including those who have said that they are god's people they will not know wakati muchipuko tanza when god will be selecting leaders leaders who are qualified by the spirit of god leaders who have accepted the truth god will empower his people to begin the work in israel return back to your foundational truths all backsliding children rudini katika missing go back to the foundational truth the first second and third angels message a total separation from sin and sinners a total separation from babylon babylon is still alive let us know to be in deception in the last work that is going on as god chose aaron through the burden when the burden begins we're cutting establish we need to foreign god let me read the last statement the last statement from the spirit of prophecy the last statement the last statement from the spirit of prophecy manuscript releases volume 13 13 mr 13 mr page 336 13 mr page 336 page 330 let me see 13 mr yes 336 she says i stated that i was a stockholder writing after the aftermath of 1888 he says and i could not let the resolution pass that there was to be special light for god's people as they neared the closing scenes of this earth's history special light another angel was to come down from heaven with a message and the whole earth was to be lighted with his glory it would be impossible for us to state just how this additional light would come it might come in a very unexpected manner in a way that would not agree with the ideas that many have conceived it is not all unlikely or contrary to the ways and works of god to send light to his people in unexpected ways we are coming back to revelation 18 we began with jesus coming to his temple in the times of the jewish nation two classes of worship us we went to the millerite experience the philadelphian church miller and his associates two classes of worshippers we are coming to tackle revelation 18 nasa to king part four part five we are coming to understand things how they are we are going to plainly speak of the spirit of prophecy and how god wants us to understand what constitutes his church is to fall upon god's people a mighty angel is to come down from heaven that is revelation chapter 18 when it begins god is to take his work to another level many will not understand the great debates will begin in adventism when the birding begins and god chooses leaders to feed his people with the truth and the pure truth we thank you for these messages bless us till the next presentation bless everyone now to bariki arjuna yes amen son",

time\n[457.9s] to bring light\n[459.9s] now the purpose of jesus coming to\n[462.2s] israel\n[463.3s] was to put down errors\n[465.8s] the rubbish of errors that have been\n[467.4s] heaping for generations\n[469.2s] and to replace back the truth in the\n[471.4s] framework of truth\n[475.8s] singing\n[484.9s] but what happened the leaders in israel\n[486.9s] could not tolerate the light\n[489.4s] and we are told in the pain of\n[490.9s] inspiration dessert of ages\n[493.6s] page 200\n[495.3s] and 32\n[497.1s] desire of ages\n[499.1s] page\n[500.0s] 200\n[501.4s] and 332\n[504.6s] and i say maybe\n[507.7s] listen carefully this is history that\n[509.4s] repeats in every succeeding generations\n[512.1s] whenever jesus will be revealed again\n[515.0s] yes\n[516.4s] because right now we are going to the\n[517.5s] military to see when the birding began\n[520.6s] again wakati machipu\n[522.7s] the same history was being repeated\n[525.9s] she says\n[527.0s] if the leaders in his israel had\n[528.8s] received christ he would have honored\n[530.7s] them as his messengers to carry the\n[532.2s] gospel to the world to them first was\n[534.6s] given the opportunity to become heralds\n[536.4s] of the kingdom of grace\n[538.1s] of god but israel knew not the time of\n[540.9s] her visitation\n[542.4s] the jealousy and distrust of the jewish\n[544.4s] leaders had opened it ripened had\n[547.1s] ripened into open hatred\n[549.2s] at the hearts of the people were turned\n[550.9s] away from jesus\n[552.6s] the sun henry\n[554.1s] yong goziwadini\n[556.2s] kosovo\n[557.4s] they had rejected christ's message and\n[559.8s] was bent upon his death therefore\n[562.6s] shikaya points to india we are taught\n[565.8s] therefore jesus departed from jerusalem\n[575.1s] jesus\n[576.1s] the presence of jesus was no longer in\n[579.4s] jerusalem he departed from jerusalem\n[582.4s] number one\n[583.6s] number two from the priests young ghost\n[586.4s] wadding\n[589.0s] number three from the temple hekalo\n[592.3s] number four\n[593.8s] the religious leaders the people who had\n[596.1s] been instructed in the law\n[597.9s] and turned to another class to proclaim\n[601.9s] his message\n[603.2s] and to gather out those who should carry\n[606.1s] the gospel to all nations\n[612.0s] luke chapter 6 verse 12.\n[619.0s] they have rejected the foundation\n[621.4s] of the jewish economy jesus was the\n[623.4s] foundation\n[624.7s] jesus came to bring back the truth\n[627.4s] to those who would have accepted them\n[629.8s] like anyway pinga\n[643.9s] luke chapter six versus number twelve\n[646.9s] lucas\n[650.2s] emma\n[651.8s] lucas\n[657.1s] coomba\n[658.6s] aka kesha\n[673.0s] we have the title of the of a wonderful\n[676.2s] topic that is called\n[678.3s] the ordained twelfth jesus began to\n[680.6s] obtain\n[682.5s] the twelve to establish\n[685.6s] his church\n[686.7s] what\n[689.0s] we had the religious leaders the temple\n[691.6s] services and jesus began to ordain\n[695.0s] a ministry to carry for the work those\n[697.7s] who would accept his message remember\n[700.9s] those who accepted the message of john\n[702.5s] the baptist accepted christ those who\n[705.3s] accepted the second message with christ\n[738.8s] as the light and life of man was\n[740.4s] rejected by the ecclesiastical\n[742.1s] authorities in the day in the days of\n[743.7s] christ\n[751.4s] so it has been rejected in every\n[754.9s] succeeding generation\n[761.8s] again and again\n[763.3s] the history of christ withdrawal from\n[765.4s] judea has been repeated\n[794.6s] they had no thought\n[796.2s] of separating themselves from the\n[798.6s] established\n[816.2s] but the religious leaders would not\n[818.1s] tolerate the light and those who had the\n[820.9s] light were forced to seek another class\n[823.1s] who were longing for the truth in our\n[825.3s] day\n[826.1s] few of the professed followers of the\n[827.8s] reformers are actuated by the spirit in\n[831.5s] a minute\n[838.2s] the bible says history must repeat\n[840.7s] and the pain of inspiration says that\n[843.3s] history of jesus withdrawing from judea\n[846.4s] will be repeated to the close of time\n[850.0s] now let's go to the second history\n[852.7s] to megalith\n[853.9s] of israel\n[860.3s] we will be revisiting that history as we\n[862.2s] move forward now\n[864.4s] let's go back to malachi chapter three\n[866.0s] to angola yes\n[868.7s] by the way\n[873.5s] malachi\n[875.0s] says the lord whom you suddenly seek\n[877.4s] shall come to his temple the first\n[879.9s] temple was in jerusalem now we are\n[882.1s] looking at the second temple\n[885.0s] before we look at the second temple\n[886.4s] maybe\n[887.7s] let's look at the book of joel chapter 2\n[889.4s] verse 23\n[890.7s] it will form the basis of understanding\n[894.0s] how many times rain\n[896.0s] has fallen in the uh in this earth\n[898.1s] history before jesus returns back for\n[900.5s] his people\n[907.7s] joel chapter 2 verse 23\n[911.0s] joel chapter 2\n[913.9s] joel\n[916.2s] chapter 2\n[939.2s] and rejoice in the lord your god for he\n[942.1s] had given you the former reign\n[944.6s] moderately at me\n[950.2s] only\n[951.7s] and he will cause to calm down for you\n[955.2s] the rain\n[958.9s] involved\n[964.1s] the rain\n[994.6s] the rain\n[996.8s] the the former rain\n[1000.3s] the rain\n[1002.8s] of the latter\n[1004.6s] the former rain\n[1006.2s] the rain\n[1007.4s] and the la terrain is\n[1050.3s] three\n[1059.8s] let us repeat the book of malachi we\n[1061.4s] want to establish\n[1063.2s] the three reigns in the history the\n[1066.4s] first one\n[1067.6s] begins at pentecost the last one\n[1072.0s] is in our time period in the time period\n[1074.4s] of\n[1075.3s] revelation 18 the loud cry of the third\n[1077.8s] angel where\n[1086.2s] we repeat\n[1087.6s] again\n[1089.7s] the bible says\n[1091.4s] behold i will send my messenger and he\n[1094.4s] shall prepare the way before me\n[1097.2s] jesus speaking\n[1098.6s] and the lord whom you will and the lord\n[1101.0s] whom you seek\n[1102.8s] shall suddenly come to his temple\n[1106.0s] even the messenger of the covenant whom\n[1108.3s] you delight in\n[1110.1s] behold he shall come save the lord of\n[1111.9s] hosts but who may abide in the day of\n[1114.2s] his coming and you shall stand when he\n[1117.1s] appear it\n[1118.3s] for he is like the refiners fire and\n[1120.7s] like the fuller soap and they shall sit\n[1123.3s] as a refiner\n[1125.1s] and a purifier of silver and he shall\n[1127.8s] purify the sons of levi and purge them\n[1130.6s] as gold\n[1131.8s] silver that they may offer unto the lord\n[1134.4s] an offering in righteousness\n[1148.5s] jesus will begin to separate two classes\n[1150.8s] of worshippers depending on those who\n[1153.0s] have accepted the whole truth their\n[1155.0s] foundational truths\n[1156.9s] or those who have rejected two classes\n[1158.9s] of worshippers now\n[1161.2s] when does this happen then a second time\n[1164.4s] we go to the history of the\n[1165.8s] philadelphian church\n[1168.1s] revelation chapter 10\n[1170.7s] the second time that jesus appears to\n[1172.5s] his people\n[1174.2s] yes\n[1179.1s] philadelphia is the great advent\n[1181.4s] millerite movement\n[1182.8s] and i want to show you from the pane of\n[1184.3s] inspiration great controversy\n[1187.4s] you read first the book of great\n[1188.8s]

trouble in adventism\n[1255.4s] today\n[1260.6s] or\n[1266.2s] people have failed to understand the\n[1267.9s] prophetic parallels of the bible and the\n[1270.4s] spirit of prophecy look at this listen\n[1272.9s] very carefully\n[1275.6s] she says\n[1276.6s] great controversy 6 11.\n[1279.8s] the angel who unites in the proclamation\n[1282.2s] of the third angel's message\n[1284.1s] is to

to\n[1333.3s] every missionary station in the world\n[1335.4s] and in some countries there were the\n[1337.5s] greatest religious interests\n[1340.3s] which has been witnessed in any land\n[1342.5s] since the reformation of the 16th\n[1344.2s] century\n[1345.6s] but these are to be far exceeded by the\n[1348.7s] mighty movement\n[1351.7s] by the mighty movement under the last\n[1354.0s] warning

himself\n[1603.1s] descended not physically of course it\n[1605.7s] was the power of god and this is another\n[1609.0s] instant that we see the holy spirit\n[1611.7s] manifestation it is jesus himself

feet were as pillars of fire that\n[1722.6s] furnace that burnt that was jesus\n[1725.0s] himself and spiritual prophecy also\n[1727.4s] shows that it was christ\n[1729.7s] it was the manifestation of jesus great\n[1732.1s] controversy 6 11 says the advent\n[1734.7s] movement of 1840 to 1844 was a glorious\n[1740.4s] manifestation of\n[1742.7s] the power of god\n[1745.2s] so jesus descending is the power of god\n[1749.7s] the power of god is the holy ghost luke\n[1752.0s] chapter 1 verses number 35.\n[1761.7s] it is the power of god and it is jesus\n[1764.0s] manifesting himself therein when

an argument against it you'll see\n[3078.6s] jimbo queen\n[3080.4s] and so it will be today in the times of\n[3083.0s] miller\n[3084.0s] when that angel descended when there was\n[3086.5s]

revelation\n[3818.5s] of jesus to come suddenly\n[3821.8s] to his temple\n[3827.2s] maybe as we introduce revelation chapter\n[3829.0s] 18\n[3832.2s] we have seen that the very first attempt\n[3834.7s] when god attempted to bring revelation\n[3836.5s] chapter 18 the latter in loud cry was in\n[3839.3s] 1888\n[3840.8s] that is the final\n[3842.6s] time their final attempt their final\n[3845.8s] work of god revelation 18 when that work\n[3849.1s] begins\n[3850.7s] two classes of worshippers again\n[3853.6s] there are those who will establish\n[3854.9s] themselves in the in their foundational\n[3856.8s] truths they are those who are going to\n[3858.6s] reject\n[3859.7s] they are those who are going to stick to\n[3861.0s] their denominations they are those who\n[3862.7s] are going to follow christ\n[3864.6s] the voice that will be crying the\n[3866.2s] wilderness there are those who are going\n[3868.0s] to be establishing god's people in the\n[3869.8s] foundational truths\n[3871.8s] there are those who are going to reject\n[3873.2s] their truths two classes of worshipers\n[3876.0s] you must understand where you belong\n[3878.4s] when that work begins officially by the\n[3881.1s] way\n[3883.7s] israel\n[3885.2s] is\n[3886.9s] let us go to jeremiah chapter 3\n[3889.0s] and see how this happened\n[3892.8s] jeremiah number fifteen\n[3895.4s] when aaron's road budded god declared\n[3898.3s] plainly\n[3899.4s] the kind of leaders that he had chosen\n[3901.9s] himself\n[3903.5s] jeremiah chapter three\n[3905.7s] verses number thirteen\n[3908.6s] jeremiah chapter 3\n[3911.7s] jeremiah chapter 3\n[3914.1s] verses number 13\n[3916.8s] jeremiah 3 verses number 13\n[3920.8s] jeremiah chapter 3 verses number 10\n[3924.4s] the bible says\n[3927.6s] so\n[3959.2s] and repent and accept that thou has\n[3961.6s] apostasized\n[3976.9s] children that have apostasized\n[3980.1s] this is a plea that god is saying\n[3985.6s] that is the first message that god gives\n[3987.6s] his children those who have apostasized\n[3989.7s] from the truth that is was what israel\n[3992.2s] had done\n[3993.4s] returning return eo backsliding children\n[3997.0s] listen very carefully\n[4002.8s] to um\n[4019.1s] let me read in english jeremiah chapter\n[4020.8s] 3 verse 15\n[4022.2s] this is prophetic\n[4024.5s] jeremiah 3 verse 15\n[4027.9s] jeremiah chapter 3 verse 15 says\n[4031.7s] verse 14 turn over sliding children say\n[4034.6s] the lord for i am married unto you and i\n[4037.7s] will take you\n[4040.7s] one of a city and two of a family and i\n[4043.9s] will bring you unto zion verse 15\n[4046.9s] and i will give you pastors according to\n[4049.7s] mine heart\n[4051.1s] which shall feed you with knowledge\n[4053.7s] and understanding\n[4055.2s] this is prophetic\n[4057.0s] there is a time period in history when\n[4058.8s] god brings\n[4060.3s] pastors whom he has chosen himself when\n[4063.7s] the burden begins\n[4065.5s] god chooses leaders\n[4075.4s] those who have rejected the truth they\n[4077.2s] will never know when god is choosing\n[4079.0s] leaders to direct his people\n[4082.9s] they will never understand\n[4085.2s] when miller began his work and when god\n[4088.1s] began to bring people out of the\n[4090.1s] denomination of churches when people\n[4092.3s] began to preach the first angels message\n[4094.6s] when god began to establish leaders to\n[4097.4s] feed people with the present truth\n[4099.7s] the churches did not know the pharisees\n[4102.2s] did not know and so it will be today\n[4105.1s] the churches will not know including\n[4107.4s] those who have said that they are god's\n[4109.8s] people they will not know\n[4111.5s] wakati muchipuko tanza when god will be\n[4114.6s] selecting leaders\n[4117.5s] leaders who are qualified by the spirit\n[4119.6s] of god\n[4120.7s] leaders who have accepted the truth god\n[4123.0s] will empower his people to begin the\n[4124.8s] work in israel\n[4126.7s] return back to your foundational truths\n[4129.1s] all backsliding children rudini katika\n[4131.4s] missing\n[4133.3s] go back to the foundational truth the\n[4134.8s] first second and third angels message a\n[4136.9s] total separation from sin and sinners a\n[4139.3s] total separation from babylon\n[4142.2s] babylon is still alive\n[4147.6s] let us know to be in deception in the\n[4149.2s] last work that is going on as god chose\n[4152.6s] aaron through the burden when the burden\n[4155.4s] begins we're cutting\n[4159.0s] establish we need to foreign god\n[4161.4s] let me read the last statement\n[4163.8s] the last statement from the spirit of\n[4165.2s] prophecy\n[4167.3s] the last statement\n[4170.2s] the last statement\n[4173.5s] from

mr\n[4195.0s] yes 336 she says\n[4198.4s] i stated that i was a stockholder\n[4201.8s] writing after the aftermath of 1888 he\n[4204.6s] says\n[4205.4s] and i could not let the resolution pass\n[4208.1s] that there was to be special light for\n[4210.7s] god's people\n[4211.9s] as they neared the closing scenes of\n[4213.6s] this earth's\n[4214.8s] history special light\n[4217.1s] another angel was to come down from\n[4219.0s] heaven with a message\n[4220.8s] and the whole earth was to be lighted\n[4222.5s] with his glory\n[4224.0s] it would be impossible for us to state\n[4227.2s] just how this additional light\n[4230.4s] would come\n[4231.6s] it might come in a very unexpected\n[4233.5s] manner in a way that would not agree\n[4235.7s] with the ideas that many have conceived\n[4239.4s] it is not all unlikely or contrary to\n[4242.6s] the ways and works of god to send light\n[4245.0s] to his people in unexpected ways\n[4249.2s] we are coming back to

us\n[4278.2s] to understand what constitutes his\n[4280.6s] church\n[4302.6s] is to fall upon god's people a mighty\n[4304.4s] angel is to come down from heaven\n[4306.6s] that is revelation chapter 18 when it\n[4308.9s] begins\n[4310.9s] god is to take his work to another level\n[4314.1s] many will not understand\n[4315.8s] the great debates will begin in\n[4317.4s] adventism when the birding

      "full_transcript": "yes welcome back we're going to see just just what is entailed in uh the history of the Jews when God called them other people to represent him and his character in the whole world in order to understand the truth as it is in Jesus let us see just what we are supposed to do we are seeing we are reading from the book The salvages and this is based on religion you must take your Bible and confirm if this is true or false go to history and find out for yourself I'm not putting this for you so that I might grind you up and force it into your thought drink it or to swallow it please check into your history and find out if you are supposed to understand the truths for this time I'm going to read from the book called These are of Ages the foundation of Education in Israel we are going to see if education was necessary in Israel was it a true education or was it absent did we have an education system we're going to see let us read from the sort of page number 69 paragraph two you think from the earliest times the faithful the faithful in Israel had given much care to the education of the youth the faithful had given much care in the education of the youth okay the Lord had directed that even from babyhood the children should be taught of his goodness and his greatness all right the CH the from babyhood the children should be taught of his goodness and his greatness especially as revealed in his law the first education was to teach children from babyhood his law God's law okay and shown in the history of Israel okay I think especially as revealed in his his law and shown in the history of Israel how he used to deal with the Israelite he's saying song and prayer and lesson from the scriptures were to be adapted to the opening mind all right song and prayer to in the heat the history of Israelites this is just what happened they used to teach their children through education based on true education they used to teach their children through education God's goodness based in his law then it is going on these are overages page 69 paragraph two chain all right the Lord who had directed that even from baby who the children should be taught of his goodness and his greatness especially as it revealed in his law and shown in the history of Israel song and prayer and lessons from the scriptures were to be adapted to the opening mind fathers and mothers who are to instruct their children that the law of God is an expression of his character all right the law of God was an expression of his character then he's saying and that as they receive the principles of the law into the heart the image of God was stressed on mind and soul that is the essence as to why Jesus came to die on the cross to restore the image of God in man all right both in the mind and in the soul much of the teaching was oral but the youth also learned to read the Hebrew writing they learn how to read and write in short not it is not essential to read Hebrew in order to understand faith in Jesus it is an emphasis of on writing and reading in order to convey a message so we are told but the youth also learned to read the Hebrew writings and the parchment roles of the Old Testament the scriptures were open to their study paragraph three page 69 deservages in the days of Christ the town or city that did not provide for the religious instruction of the young was regarded as Under The Curse Of God yet the teaching had become formal so in a education just as today people required regard those who did not receive education as low right now we can see it just this similarly with we read it it was in Israel so we are reading it's saying yet the teaching had become formal teaching had become so tradition had in a great degree supplanted the scripture tradition had supplanted the scripture okay so tradition what tradition will always approved through education just watch as false education is spreading in the land the True Church of God is going to spread in the land with tradition of men putting on skirts anyway well just going on we are told tradition had in a great degree Supply in the scriptures true education will lead the youth to seek the Lord what seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him acts 17 verse 27 and quote but the Jewish teachers gave the attention to the matters of ceremony the mind was crowded with material all right so we are told that education was in Israel let us see just what happened that education in Israel during the time of Jesus got corrupt got corrupted uh before we read that I'm going to open with a scripture that says John 7 verse number John 7. verse number uh verse 10 it's saying but when his Brethren were gone up then when he was up and to the fists not openly but as it were in secret then verse 11 then the Jesus sought him at the feast and said where is he and verse 12 and he and there was much murmuring among the Jews concerning him for some said he is a good man others saying no but he deceived the people all right so through education versus false education let's see verse number 14 verse 13 John 7 13 how we eat no man speak openly of him for fear of the Jews all right they feared because he had the true education and the Jews had adopted another education we will see if it is true or false we're going to read just from our resources we're saying verse 14. now about the midst of the Feast of in the Middle East of the feast in the Middle East of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught so people are not taught these things so he went up in the middies of the Fists in the middle when it is climax he went to teach the doctrine of true education he went to teach according to True education that God had directed so this let's go and see what he thought how he thought verse 15 and the Jews Marvel saying how no this man let us having never learned I don't know this man let us having never learned so Jesus never went to the school of the Jews so as we read in the set of Ages page 80 that Jesus the rabbits knew Jesus never attended their schools as now we are going to see just how Jesus taught ah this is the services page 70.1 it is saying the Child Jesus did not receive instruction in the synagogue schools never why we are going to find out a lot much much more he's saying his mother was his first human teacher from her lips and from the Scrolls of the prophet he learned of heavenly things the very Words which he himself had spoken to Moses for Israel was for Israel he was now taught at his mother's knee okay so Jesus is receiving the true education home schooling homeschooling all right so he's saying he was now taught at his mother's knee as he Advanced from childhood to youth he did not seek the schools of the rabbis all right as he Advanced from childhoods to youth he did not seek the schools of the rabies he needed not the education to be obtained from such sources okay for God was his instructor all right now those are that is the spirit of true Reformation Spirit of Tourism our schools are teaching religion from the East and some parents are not aware of this we are parents we are not even checking the books our children are learning baptism infant baptism those are pagan Pagan things that are inherited by the Catholicism called Catholic but that is Pagan Pagan my friend they are learning how to communicate with the Dead how to communicate with Spirits they call it Spirits have you have you checked those books we are going to open those books line upon line I'm going to screen them up and to bring them up in the as facilities are going to be brought in God is going to send servants who are going to serve in different capacity machines are going to be here and we're going to expose all that whatever achieving and learning now we are in in the book The salvages page number 70.1 it ends and says I see advance from childhood to youth he did not seek the school of the rabbis he needed not the education to be obtained from such sausage for God was this instruction the question asked during the same the savior's Ministry how now is this man let us having Never Land does not indicate that Jesus was unable to read but merely that he had not received a rabbinical education they never saw Jesus in their schools because in that time as in the previous video that I just gave out was the kingdom of the Greeks the Greeks had colonized the old Earth and the old Earth had been hellenized it has the Earth had received a Greek education with its tradition and and rights but then we are going to see how Israelites had made an alliance with the Fallen Nation Greek and Roman Empire let's go and see we are going to understand events that transpire in the time of Jesus foreshadowed the time of the 144 we are going to see if these things show just our duties it continues how nice this does not indicate that Jesus was unable to read me but merely that he had received he had not received merely he had not received a rabbinical education John 17 7 verse 15. since he gained knowledge as we may do his intimate intimate acquaintance with the scripture shows how diligently his early years were given to the study of God's word okay okay and spread out before him was The Great Library of God's created works all right he who had made all things started the lessons which is on hand had written in art and sky under sky and and sea and sky apart from the Unholy ways of the world he gathered stones of scientific knowledge from nature he studied the life of plants and animals and the life of man from his earliest year he was possessed of one purpose he lived to bless others for this he found resources in nature for this he found resources in nature new ideas of ways and means flushed into his mind as he studied plant as he studied the plant all right um so it is a study plan for this he found resources in nature new ideas of ways and means flashed into his mind as he studied plant life and animal life continually he was seeking to draw from things sin illustration by which he presents the living Oracles of God how to teach the truth of Heaven he had to learn he had to learn as a human he had to see just what human beings are acquainted to in order to teach them the things of heaven then he said continually he was seeking to draw something seen illustration by which he to present the living Oracles of God linking the Heavenly things with the Earthly Jesus had to take time with that in order to know our weaknesses he had to take all that time all three years of ministration to finalize everything he's God my friend but all of us combined we can't finish studying these art actually recently the scientists started discovering some other organism in under the sea that had been existing so it it is not even in reckon they are already putting it in the record so that finding out new on new things yet Jesus took three years to teach the Oracle of heaven so we are told this okay he studied plant life fast forward The Parables by which during his ministry he loved to teach his lessons of Truth show how open his Spirit was to the influences of Nature and how he had gathered the spiritual teaching from the surrounding of his daily life so we see Jesus have obtaining true education in nature right now as you are watching as you have seen just right around us this is nature we are planning and we are already in the ground breaking the ground in order that the this place may be viable for True education and for you you can see we had already begun a modern toilet this is a building of a modern toilet it is under construction and right in front of you on the other side of me you can see we had a structure a simple structure The Lord Is Us directing us to make simple structure for True education we are told as we make two we make ground for True education the Lord will send help let those who have meetings bring their means in order to glorify God to see just what we have to do in this last day and how we should know that these things are taking place are to take place read the signs of the time and knowing the time Romans chapter 13 11 knowing the time that that day is so closer then we should allow arise from let's not sleep for the sleeping virgins to arise they must know the time in which they are living in so we are just uh seeing the education system that Jesus did not receive and the education system which is true that Jesus received as a young alien boy so let me go fast forward to see just what the education the type of education that Jesus received the same same book these are of Ages we are going to sing the book called Desire of Ages page 86 paragraph two the type of education was it a lower education style was it a middle education or was it a higher education and what is high education let's see uh the surveys page number 86 paragraph two it goes saying his brothers are the sons of Joseph were called sided with the rabbis they insisted that the tradition must be heated as if they were the requirements of God they even regarded the precepts of men more highly than the word of God and they were greatly annoyed at the clear penetration of Jesus in distinguishing between the false and the true all right so true education enables you to distinguish true and false his strict obedience to the law of God they condemned as stubbornness that was a reformer my friend that was a reformer they were surprised at the knowledge and wisdom he showed in answering the rubbish they knew that he had not received instruction from the wise men yet they could not but see that he was an instructor to them okay so he was an instructor why because of the education system which he had learned from his babyhood to his manhood through his youthful uh alive he's saying the chain from the wife yet they could not but see that he was an instructor to them to the rabbis they recognized that his education was of a higher time than their own all right they recognized that his education was of a higher type than their own but they did not decide that he had access to the Tree of Life okay so there is something known as the Tree of Life yesterday as we are doing our series we realized that in the Garden of Eden there was a tree fast the tree of knowledge second the tree of life so we have the tree of false and true and we have the tree of pain that perpetuates life so we are seeing that the book The the that in the garden of Heaven had Eden we see that there was a section of instruction Where Angels often Revisited in order to instruct Adam and Eve then we can understand all the prophetic patterns are exact and all striking at the same level just as we are in order to inherit life we have to avoid the mixed education that is mixed true and false and we have to go straight to the Tree of Life which represented Christ Jesus all right so we are seeing but they did not discern that he had access to the Tree of Life a source of knowledge of which they were ignorant okay so Christ was not exclusive and he had given special offense to the Pharisees by departing in his respect from their rigid rules he found the domain of religion fans in by high walls of seclusion as to Sacred a matter for everyday life these words of petition he overthrew true education will overthrow petition okay was of petition or self-service true education will not serve serve true education will serve others the nation will be rid of bribery rib of corruption even your own child will not bribe you therefore you will have fruits of true education the Treaty of life we love we love its bearing upon a nation like this let us see just what true education did in the life of Jesus we want to see just what it was okay uh we are seeing from the book called The sarovated the Simpson book uh seeing the type uh the education system of Jesus what it did to him and others all right was it self-service of others the Jewish that is deserve Ages page 317 paragraph three it is saying this way it is saying the Jews had been instructed from childhood concerning the work of the Messiah all right so true education she will teach you the work of Jesus the work of Salvation the true service the work in which your soul and mind is to be saved like likewise we are seeing the Jews were taught from childhood concerning the work of the Mississauga they inspired utterances so Patrick and Prophets and the symbolic teaching of the sacrificial service had been theirs they were learning in the symbolic teaching in this in the synagogue I mean or in the temple here we are told in the temple they were learning all these sacrificial service so this object lesson about the Messiah but they had disregarded the light and now they saw in Jesus nothing to be desired but the Centurion burning Hedonism Centurion was born in Hidden can you see that Centurion the Centurion we know that the Sanhedrin was full of leaders who were given for self-service now here at the side of which shows us that the Centurion burning Hedonism educated in the idolatry of Imperial Ron all right so they were indicated by the Roman trained as a soldier seemingly cut off from spiritual life by his education and surroundings and still further shot out by the begoty of the Jews and by the content of his own countrymen for the people of Israel this man perceived the truth to which the children of Abraham were blinded so there was a Roman Centurion this Roman Centurion was he learned from a hidden background his background is based on Hedonism therefore what happened he did not wait to see whether he the Jews themselves will receive the one who claimed to be their Messiah so the question is we want to see that the true what true education imparted in the life of Jesus we are seeing that in his life he had to impact the Tree of Life to others through understanding true education like was even unto us we have to impart the light unto the World by understanding just what true education can do to us and our own children if our children received to education that will be true love cry but if they receive no true education they will fail in the courts when they will they shall be summoned before the loyal before the Great Men of the Earth so this Centurion we are told that the Centurion accessed Jesus he did not care whether they use themselves will receive the one who claimed to be their Messer as the light which lighted every man that coming into the world John 1 9. had shown upon him he had though far off the Sun the glory of the Son of God so Jesus reflected the glory of his father okay to the lost the Centurion was a Roman soldier at a capacity of centurion this is a capacity the title of centurion uh sorry I just blinded it as if it was a sun heading but Centurion was the class of I mean it was a category of soldiers who had their duty to be done and they were called Centurion there were those who were called uh other names but now this is a centurion okay okay so we are told that Jesus Jesus a type of education had been that of imparting the blessings of Heaven so what is higher education what does the spiritual prophecy describe as higher education we at all in the book called this Center of Ages page 464 paragraph four it goes on and says that was the True Light which lighted every man that cometh into the world quote the world had the world has had its great teachers men of giant elect and wonderful research men whose utterances have stimulated thought and open to view fast fields of knowledge and this men have been honored as guides and many factors of their race okay like isocrine like soaked like Aristotle glotto this man their words tear star our thoughts into new Fields okay so we are tall in this way but there is one who stands higher than they why don't you go to the one Higher good as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God God no man had seen God at any time they only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he had declared him John 1 12 and verse 18. we can trace the line of the world's great teachers as far back as human record extends okay we can trace back the line okay and see there was great teachers as far back as human records extend but the light was before them so the Highlight was before before them okay and we're told as the moon and the stars of the solar system Shine by The reflected light of the Sun so as far as their teaching is truth do the world's great thinkers reflect the Rays of the son of righteousness okay all of them got their knowledge and wisdom from the one who is higher just like the sun reflects its rays are bounces Rays upon the solar system so we are told that every Gem of thought every flash of the intellect is from the light of the world in these days we hear much about higher education the true higher education is that impacted by him in whom are heed all Treasures of the with of the will of wisdom and knowledge in him was life and the life was the highlight of men Colossians 2 3 and John chapter 1 verse 4. could he that followeth me would say Jesus shall not work in darkness but shall have the light of life and quote the server is 464 paragraph four we are told that true education is to be established in the last days through education medical missionaries centers of influence must be established in the last days in order for you and me to overcome the Beast and the image please scroll the wall of my that Facebook you will see a study on how to overcome the Beast and how to overcome His Image and how to overcome his name and the number of his

righteously we must understand how much he loves us the Lord has loved us and has brought us to his side how did he do that that is to the to be the question of to education thank you be welcome in all capacity support the work and send in your means it is greatly valued as a food program as as sustaining of this ministry work program let",
      "timestamped_transcript": "[1.0s] yes welcome back we're going to see just\n[3.4s] just what is entailed in uh the history\n[6.5s] of the Jews when God called them other\n[8.6s] people to represent him and his\n[10.7s] character in the whole world in order to\n[12.8s] understand the truth as it is in Jesus\n[15.3s] let us see just what we are supposed to\n[18.0s] do we are seeing we are reading from the\n[19.9s] book The salvages and this is based on\n[23.9s] religion you must take your Bible and\n[26.8s] confirm if this is true or false go to\n[29.3s] history and find out for yourself I'm\n[31.8s] not putting this for you so that I might\n[34.0s] grind you up and force it into your\n[36.4s] thought drink it or to swallow it please\n[39.3s] check into your history and find out if\n[42.1s] you are supposed to understand the\n[44.2s] truths for this time I'm going to read\n[45.8s] from the book called These are of Ages\n[48.8s] the foundation of Education in Israel we\n[52.3s] are going to see if education was\n[54.2s] necessary in Israel was it a true\n[56.5s] education or was it absent did we have\n[59.6s] an education system we're going to see\n[61.8s] let us read from the sort of page number\n[64.4s] 69 paragraph two you think from the\n[67.1s] earliest times the faithful the faithful\n[70.0s] in Israel had given much care to the\n[72.6s] education of the youth the faithful had\n[75.6s] given much care in the education of the\n[78.5s] youth okay\n[80.5s] the Lord had directed that even from\n[83.0s] babyhood the children should be taught\n[85.0s] of his goodness and his greatness all\n[88.1s] right the CH the from babyhood the\n[90.7s] children should be taught of his\n[91.8s] goodness and his greatness especially as\n[94.5s] revealed in his law the first education\n[97.4s] was to teach children from babyhood his\n[101.5s] law God's law okay and shown in the\n[104.2s] history of Israel okay\n[107.5s] I think especially as revealed in his\n[110.3s] his law and shown in the history of\n[113.3s] Israel how he used to deal with the\n[115.3s] Israelite he's saying song and prayer\n[117.3s] and lesson from the scriptures were to\n[119.8s] be adapted to the opening mind all right\n[122.3s] song and prayer to in the heat the\n[125.1s] history of Israelites this is just what\n[126.8s] happened they used to teach their\n[128.6s] children through education based on true\n[132.2s] education they used to teach their\n[134.1s] children through education God's\n[136.2s] goodness based in his law then it is\n[138.7s] going on these are overages page 69\n[141.3s] paragraph two chain all right\n[144.5s] the Lord who had directed that even from\n[146.7s] baby who the children should be taught\n[148.3s] of his goodness and his greatness\n[150.1s] especially as it revealed in his law and\n[153.1s] shown in the history of Israel song and\n[155.6s] prayer and lessons from the scriptures\n[157.4s] were to be adapted to the opening mind\n[160.0s] fathers and mothers who are to instruct\n[162.4s] their children that the law of God is an\n[165.5s] expression of his character all right\n[167.6s] the law of God was an expression of his\n[171.1s] character then he's saying and that as\n[173.5s] they receive the principles of the law\n[175.3s] into the heart the image of God was\n[177.7s] stressed on mind and soul\n[180.2s] that is the essence as to why Jesus came\n[183.1s] to die on the cross to restore the image\n[186.2s] of God in man all right\n[190.0s] both in the mind and in the soul much of\n[192.5s] the teaching was oral but the youth also\n[195.4s] learned to read the Hebrew writing they\n[199.1s] learn how to read and write in short not\n[201.5s] it is not essential to read\n[203.6s] Hebrew in order to understand faith in\n[205.6s] Jesus\n[206.5s] it is an emphasis of on writing and\n[210.2s] reading in order to convey a message so\n[212.3s] we are told but the youth also learned\n[215.0s] to read the Hebrew writings and the\n[217.3s] parchment roles of the Old Testament the\n[219.2s] scriptures were open to their study\n[222.4s] paragraph three page 69 deservages in\n[225.4s] the days of Christ the town or city that\n[228.2s] did not provide for the religious\n[229.6s] instruction of the young was regarded as\n[231.8s] Under The Curse Of God yet the teaching\n[234.0s] had become formal so in a education just\n[237.5s] as today people required regard those\n[239.8s] who did not receive education as low\n[242.3s] right now we can see it just this\n[245.3s] similarly with we read it it was in\n[248.3s] Israel so we are reading it's saying yet\n[251.0s] the teaching had become formal teaching\n[253.2s] had become so tradition had in a great\n[256.2s] degree supplanted the scripture\n[258.2s] tradition had supplanted the scripture\n[261.4s] okay so tradition what tradition will\n[265.0s] always approved through education just\n[268.1s] watch as false education is spreading in\n[271.1s] the land the True Church of God is going\n[272.9s] to spread in the land with tradition of\n[275.0s] men putting on skirts anyway well just\n[277.9s] going on\n[279.0s] we are told tradition had in a great\n[281.4s] degree Supply in the scriptures true\n[282.9s] education will lead the youth to seek\n[285.2s] the Lord what seek the Lord if happily\n[287.6s] they might feel after him and find him\n[289.7s] acts 17 verse 27 and quote but the\n[293.0s] Jewish teachers gave the attention to\n[294.9s] the matters of ceremony the mind was\n[297.1s] crowded with material all right so we\n[300.2s] are told that education was in Israel\n[304.4s] let us see just what happened\n[307.9s] that education in Israel during the time\n[311.4s] of Jesus got corrupt got corrupted uh\n[314.8s] before we read that I'm going to open\n[316.5s] with a scripture that says John 7 verse\n[319.0s] number John 7. verse number\n[322.2s] uh verse 10 it's saying but when his\n[326.3s] Brethren were gone up then when he was\n[328.6s] up and to the fists not openly but as it\n[331.4s] were in secret then verse 11 then the\n[333.7s] Jesus sought him at the feast and said\n[335.3s] where is he and verse 12 and he\n[338.9s] and there was much murmuring among the\n[340.9s] Jews concerning him for some said he is\n[343.7s] a good man others saying no but he\n[346.0s] deceived the people all right so through\n[347.9s] education versus false education let's\n[350.6s] see verse number 14 verse 13 John 7 13\n[353.5s] how we eat no man speak openly of him\n[356.8s] for fear of the Jews all right they\n[358.6s] feared because he had the true education\n[360.5s] and the Jews had adopted another\n[363.1s] education we will see if it is true or\n[365.4s] false we're going to read just from our\n[367.1s] resources we're saying verse 14. now\n[369.8s] about the midst of the Feast of in the\n[372.3s] Middle East of the feast in the Middle\n[374.0s] East of the feast Jesus went up into the\n[376.9s] temple and taught\n[378.5s] so people are not taught these things so\n[381.1s] he went up in the middies of the Fists\n[383.5s] in the middle when it is climax he went\n[386.9s] to teach\n[388.0s] the doctrine of true education he went\n[390.9s] to teach according to True education\n[393.3s] that God had directed so this let's go\n[397.1s] and see what he thought how he thought\n[400.0s] verse 15 and the Jews Marvel saying how\n[402.2s] no this man let us having never learned\n[405.4s] I don't know this man let us having\n[407.5s] never learned so Jesus\n[409.4s] never went to the school of the Jews so\n[413.0s] as we read in the set of Ages page 80\n[415.4s] that Jesus the rabbits knew Jesus never\n[418.4s] attended their schools as now we are\n[421.0s] going to see just how Jesus taught\n[425.9s] ah this is the services page 70.1 it is\n[430.0s] saying the Child Jesus did not receive\n[431.5s] instruction in the synagogue schools\n[433.6s] never\n[434.8s] why we are going to find out\n[437.5s] a lot much much more he's saying\n[440.6s] his mother was his first human teacher\n[442.7s] from her lips and from the Scrolls of\n[444.7s] the prophet he learned of heavenly\n[446.8s] things the very Words which he himself\n[448.9s] had spoken to Moses for Israel was for\n[451.7s] Israel he was now taught at his mother's\n[454.7s] knee okay so Jesus is receiving the true\n[457.4s] education home schooling\n[459.5s] homeschooling\n[461.1s] all right so he's saying he was now\n[463.4s] taught at his mother's knee as he\n[465.5s] Advanced from childhood to youth he did\n[467.7s] not seek the schools of the rabbis all\n[470.2s] right as he Advanced from childhoods to\n[472.4s] youth he did not seek the schools of the\n[474.7s] rabies he needed not the education to be\n[476.8s] obtained from such sources okay for God\n[479.8s] was his instructor all right now those\n[483.1s] are that is the spirit of true\n[485.3s] Reformation\n[486.8s] Spirit of Tourism our schools are\n[489.2s] teaching religion from the East\n[492.3s] and some parents are not aware of this\n[494.7s] we are parents we are not even checking\n[496.8s] the books our children are learning\n[498.8s] baptism infant baptism those are pagan\n[502.2s] Pagan things that are inherited by the\n[505.0s] Catholicism called Catholic but that is\n[507.4s] Pagan Pagan my friend they are learning\n[510.8s] how to communicate with the Dead how to\n[513.1s] communicate with Spirits they call it\n[515.5s] Spirits have you have you checked those\n[517.5s] books we are going to open those books\n[520.8s] line upon line I'm going to screen them\n[523.9s] up and to bring them up in the as\n[526.4s] facilities are going to be brought in\n[529.1s] God is going to send servants who are\n[531.9s] going to serve in different capacity\n[534.5s] machines are going to be here and we're\n[537.0s] going to expose all that whatever\n[539.0s] achieving and learning now we are in in\n[541.6s] the book The salvages page number 70.1\n[544.8s] it ends and says I see advance from\n[547.1s] childhood to youth he did not seek the\n[549.2s] school of the rabbis he needed not the\n[551.2s] education to be obtained from such\n[553.5s] sausage for God was this instruction\n[556.4s] the question asked during the same the\n[558.8s] savior's Ministry\n[565.2s] how now is this man let us having Never\n[567.4s] Land does not indicate that Jesus was\n[569.4s] unable to read but merely that he had\n[571.7s] not received a rabbinical education they\n[573.8s] never saw Jesus in their schools because\n[576.2s] in that time as in the previous video\n[578.8s] that I just gave out was the kingdom of\n[582.0s] the Greeks the Greeks had colonized the\n[584.0s] old Earth and the old Earth had been\n[585.6s] hellenized it has the Earth had received\n[588.3s] a Greek education with its tradition and\n[591.2s] and rights but then we are going to see\n[594.6s] how Israelites had made an alliance with\n[598.6s] the Fallen Nation Greek and Roman Empire\n[601.8s] let's go and see we are going to\n[603.9s] understand events that transpire in the\n[606.5s] time of Jesus\n[608.0s] foreshadowed the time of the 144 we are\n[611.8s] going to see if these things\n[614.6s] show just our duties\n[617.5s] it continues how nice this does not\n[620.2s] indicate that Jesus was unable to read\n[621.9s] me but merely that he had received he\n[624.2s] had not received merely he had not\n[626.5s] received a rabbinical education John 17\n[629.1s] 7 verse 15. since he gained knowledge as\n[632.8s] we may do his intimate intimate\n[635.5s] acquaintance with the scripture shows\n[637.7s] how diligently his early years were\n[640.7s] given to the study of God's word okay\n[643.1s] okay and spread out before him was The\n[646.7s] Great Library of God's created works all\n[649.5s] right he who had made all things started\n[652.1s] the lessons which is on hand had written\n[654.4s] in art and sky under sky and and sea and\n[657.3s] sky apart from the Unholy ways of the\n[660.4s] world he gathered stones of scientific\n[662.4s] knowledge from nature he studied the\n[665.3s] life of plants and animals and the life\n[668.0s] of man from his earliest year he was\n[670.9s] possessed of one purpose he lived to\n[674.2s] bless others for this he found resources\n[677.0s] in nature for this he found resources in\n[680.9s] nature new ideas of ways and means\n[683.3s] flushed into his mind as he studied\n[685.9s] plant as he studied the plant all right\n[690.1s] um so it is a study plan for this he\n[692.5s] found resources in nature new ideas of\n[694.2s] ways and means flashed into his mind as\n[696.4s] he studied plant life and animal life\n[698.1s] continually he was seeking to draw from\n[700.9s] things sin illustration by which he\n[704.4s] presents the living Oracles of God how\n[707.0s] to teach the truth of Heaven he had to\n[709.0s] learn he had to learn as a human he had\n[711.5s] to see just what human beings are\n[714.2s] acquainted to in order to teach them the\n[717.7s] things of heaven then he said\n[719.0s] continually he was seeking to draw\n[720.6s] something seen illustration by which he\n[723.2s] to present the living Oracles of God\n[725.2s] linking the Heavenly things with the\n[728.0s] Earthly Jesus had to take time with that\n[730.7s] in order to know our weaknesses he had\n[733.3s] to take all that time\n[736.2s] all three years of ministration\n[739.5s] to finalize everything he's God my\n[743.0s] friend but all of us combined we can't\n[746.5s] finish studying these art actually\n[748.4s] recently the scientists started\n[750.7s] discovering some other organism in under\n[752.9s] the sea that had been existing so it it\n[756.2s] is not even in reckon they are already\n[758.2s] putting it in the record so that finding\n[760.1s] out new on new things yet Jesus took\n[762.7s] three years to teach\n[764.2s] the Oracle of heaven so we are told this\n[768.3s] okay he studied plant life fast forward\n[771.2s] The Parables by which during his\n[773.4s] ministry he loved to teach his lessons\n[775.7s] of Truth show how open his Spirit was to\n[778.5s] the influences of Nature and how he had\n[780.8s] gathered the spiritual teaching from the\n[783.0s] surrounding of his daily life so we see\n[785.5s] Jesus have obtaining true education in\n[789.7s] nature right now as you are watching as\n[792.4s] you have seen just right around us this\n[796.1s] is nature we are planning and we are\n[798.8s] already in the ground breaking the\n[801.0s] ground in order that the this place may\n[803.9s] be viable for True education and for you\n[808.4s] you can see we had already begun a\n[812.0s] modern toilet this is a building of a\n[815.8s] modern toilet it is under construction\n[817.8s] and right in front of you on the other\n[821.5s] side of me you can see we had a\n[824.3s] structure a simple structure The Lord Is\n[827.2s] Us directing us to make simple structure\n[832.1s] for True education we are told as we\n[835.0s] make two we make ground for True\n[837.2s] education the Lord will send help let\n[839.6s] those who have meetings bring their\n[841.9s] means in order to glorify God to see\n[844.3s] just what we have to do in this last day\n[848.2s] and how we should know that these things\n[851.5s] are taking place are to take place read\n[854.9s] the signs of the time and knowing the\n[857.1s] time Romans chapter 13 11 knowing the\n[860.9s] time that that day is so closer\n[864.4s] then we should allow arise from let's\n[868.9s] not sleep for the sleeping virgins to\n[871.7s] arise they must know the time in which\n[873.4s] they are living in so\n[875.6s] we are just uh seeing the education\n[878.6s] system that Jesus did not receive and\n[882.4s] the education system which is true that\n[885.4s] Jesus received as a young alien boy\n[890.1s] so let me go fast forward to see\n[895.0s] just what the education the type of\n[898.3s] education that Jesus received the same\n[900.8s] same book these are of Ages we are going\n[903.5s] to sing the book called Desire of Ages\n[906.4s] page 86 paragraph two\n[910.0s] the type of education was it a lower\n[913.4s] education style was it a middle\n[916.9s] education or was it a higher education\n[919.4s] and what is high education let's see uh\n[923.1s] the surveys page number 86 paragraph two\n[926.5s] it goes saying his brothers are the sons\n[929.4s] of Joseph were called sided with the\n[931.6s] rabbis they insisted that the tradition\n[933.5s] must be heated as if they were the\n[935.9s] requirements of God they even regarded\n[937.9s] the precepts of men more highly than the\n[939.8s] word of God and they were greatly\n[941.6s] annoyed at the clear penetration of\n[943.2s] Jesus in distinguishing between the\n[945.3s] false and the true all right so true\n[947.2s] education enables you to distinguish\n[949.0s] true and false his strict obedience to\n[951.7s] the law of God they condemned as\n[953.6s] stubbornness that was a reformer my\n[955.5s] friend that was a reformer\n[957.5s] they were surprised at the knowledge and\n[959.7s] wisdom he showed in answering the\n[961.5s] rubbish they knew that he had not\n[963.3s] received instruction from the wise men\n[965.2s] yet they could not but see that he was\n[967.9s] an instructor to them okay so he was an\n[970.7s] instructor why because of the education\n[973.4s] system which he had learned from his\n[976.3s] babyhood to his manhood\n[979.4s] through his youthful uh alive he's\n[982.7s] saying\n[985.4s] the chain from the wife yet they could\n[988.4s] not but see that he was an instructor to\n[990.4s] them to the rabbis they recognized that\n[993.1s] his education was of a higher time\n[995.9s] than their own\n[997.9s] all right they recognized that his\n[1001.6s] education was of a higher type than\n[1004.6s] their own but they did not decide that\n[1007.0s] he had access to the Tree of Life okay\n[1010.9s] so there is something known as the Tree\n[1013.7s] of Life yesterday as we are doing our\n[1015.7s] series we realized that in the Garden of\n[1017.9s] Eden there was a tree fast the tree of\n[1020.6s] knowledge second the tree of life so we\n[1023.5s] have the tree of false and true and we\n[1027.0s] have the tree of pain that perpetuates\n[1030.0s] life so we are seeing that the book The\n[1032.6s] the that in the garden of Heaven had\n[1034.9s] Eden we see that there was a section of\n[1038.5s] instruction Where Angels often Revisited\n[1041.2s] in order to instruct Adam and Eve then\n[1043.9s] we can understand all the prophetic\n[1046.5s] patterns are exact and\n[1050.3s] all striking at the same level just as\n[1054.0s] we are in order to inherit life we have\n[1056.6s] to avoid the mixed education that is\n[1060.3s] mixed true and false and we have to go\n[1063.7s] straight to the Tree of Life which\n[1066.0s] represented Christ Jesus all right so we\n[1069.7s] are seeing but they did not discern that\n[1072.3s] he had access to the Tree of Life a\n[1074.2s] source of knowledge of which they were\n[1076.0s] ignorant okay so Christ was not\n[1079.0s] exclusive and he had given special\n[1081.4s] offense to the Pharisees by departing in\n[1084.0s] his respect from their rigid rules he\n[1086.7s] found the domain of religion fans in by\n[1089.3s] high walls of seclusion as to Sacred a\n[1091.6s] matter for everyday life these words of\n[1093.8s] petition he overthrew true education\n[1096.3s] will overthrow petition okay was of\n[1100.9s] petition or self-service true education\n[1104.3s] will not serve serve true education will\n[1106.9s] serve others the nation will be rid of\n[1111.7s] bribery rib of corruption even your own\n[1114.3s] child will not bribe you therefore you\n[1117.1s] will have\n[1118.6s] fruits of true education the Treaty of\n[1121.5s] life we love we love its bearing upon a\n[1124.1s] nation like this\n[1126.2s] let us see just what true education did\n[1129.5s] in the life of Jesus we want to see just\n[1132.3s] what it was okay uh we are seeing from\n[1136.6s] the book called The sarovated the\n[1138.6s] Simpson book\n[1141.1s] uh seeing\n[1143.2s] the type uh the education system of\n[1145.9s] Jesus what it did to him and others all\n[1149.4s] right was it self-service of others\n[1152.1s] the Jewish that is deserve Ages page 317\n[1156.3s] paragraph three it is saying this way it\n[1159.0s] is saying the Jews had been instructed\n[1160.9s] from childhood concerning the work of\n[1162.7s] the Messiah all right so true education\n[1165.1s] she will teach you the work of Jesus the\n[1169.0s] work of Salvation the true service the\n[1172.0s] work in which your soul and mind is to\n[1175.2s] be saved like likewise we are seeing the\n[1177.9s] Jews were taught from childhood\n[1179.3s] concerning the work of the Mississauga\n[1181.2s] they inspired utterances so Patrick and\n[1183.8s] Prophets and the symbolic teaching of\n[1185.5s] the sacrificial service had been theirs\n[1188.0s] they were learning in the symbolic\n[1189.8s] teaching in this in the synagogue I mean\n[1193.0s] or in the temple here we are told in the\n[1195.6s] temple they were learning all these\n[1197.8s] sacrificial service\n[1199.6s] so this object lesson about the Messiah\n[1202.6s] but they had disregarded the light and\n[1206.4s] now they saw in Jesus nothing to be\n[1208.6s] desired but the Centurion burning\n[1211.3s] Hedonism Centurion was born in Hidden\n[1214.3s] can you see that Centurion the Centurion\n[1217.7s] we know that the Sanhedrin was full of\n[1221.1s] leaders who were given for self-service\n[1224.8s] now here at the side of which shows us\n[1227.7s] that the Centurion burning Hedonism\n[1230.7s] educated in the idolatry of Imperial Ron\n[1234.1s] all right so they were indicated by the\n[1236.1s] Roman trained as a soldier seemingly cut\n[1239.2s] off from spiritual life by his education\n[1241.2s] and surroundings and still further shot\n[1243.3s] out by the begoty of the Jews and by the\n[1245.8s] content of his own countrymen for the\n[1248.1s] people of Israel this man\n[1250.2s] perceived the truth to which the\n[1253.2s] children of Abraham were blinded so\n[1255.2s] there was a Roman Centurion this Roman\n[1257.5s] Centurion was\n[1259.2s] he learned from a hidden background his\n[1263.6s] background is based on Hedonism\n[1265.5s] therefore what happened he did not wait\n[1268.4s] to see whether he the Jews themselves\n[1270.7s] will receive the one who claimed to be\n[1272.9s] their Messiah so the question is we want\n[1275.1s] to see that the true what true education\n[1278.0s] imparted in the life of Jesus we are\n[1280.0s] seeing that in his life he had to impact\n[1282.7s] the Tree of Life to others through\n[1285.1s] understanding true education like was\n[1288.2s] even unto us we have to impart the light\n[1290.4s] unto the World by understanding just\n[1293.2s] what true education can do to us and our\n[1296.0s] own children if our children received to\n[1298.0s] education that will be true love cry but\n[1301.1s] if they receive no true education they\n[1303.4s] will fail in the courts when they will\n[1305.8s] they shall be summoned before the loyal\n[1308.2s] before the Great Men of the Earth\n[1311.4s] so this Centurion we are told that the\n[1313.8s] Centurion accessed Jesus he did not care\n[1317.2s] whether they use themselves will receive\n[1319.3s] the one who claimed to be their Messer\n[1321.1s] as the light which lighted every man\n[1323.5s] that coming into the world John 1 9. had\n[1326.9s] shown upon him he had though far off the\n[1329.9s] Sun the glory of the Son of God so Jesus\n[1332.2s] reflected the glory\n[1334.3s] of his father okay to the lost the\n[1337.8s] Centurion was a Roman soldier at a\n[1340.6s] capacity of centurion this is a capacity\n[1343.2s] the title of centurion uh sorry I just\n[1346.9s] blinded it as if it was a sun heading\n[1349.3s] but Centurion was the class of I mean it\n[1354.1s] was a category of soldiers who had their\n[1356.6s] duty to be done and they were called\n[1358.3s] Centurion there were those who were\n[1359.7s] called uh other names but now this is a\n[1362.2s] centurion okay okay so we are told that\n[1364.8s] Jesus\n[1366.4s] Jesus a type of education had been that\n[1370.6s] of imparting the blessings of Heaven\n[1374.7s] so what is higher education what does\n[1377.5s] the spiritual prophecy describe as\n[1379.5s] higher education we at all in the book\n[1381.9s] called this Center of Ages page 464\n[1385.0s] paragraph four it goes on and says that\n[1388.4s] was the True Light which lighted every\n[1390.5s] man that cometh into the world quote the\n[1393.5s] world had the world has had its great\n[1396.0s] teachers men of giant elect and\n[1398.1s] wonderful research men whose utterances\n[1400.2s] have stimulated thought and open to view\n[1402.1s] fast fields of knowledge and this men\n[1404.5s] have been honored as guides and many\n[1406.6s] factors of their race okay\n[1409.3s] like isocrine like soaked like Aristotle\n[1413.6s] glotto\n[1415.2s] this man their words tear star our\n[1418.9s] thoughts\n[1419.8s] into new Fields okay so we are tall in\n[1423.2s] this way but there is one who stands\n[1425.4s] higher than they why don't you go to the\n[1427.5s] one Higher\n[1429.2s] good as many as received him to them\n[1431.5s] gave he power to become the sons of God\n[1433.2s] God no man had seen God at any time they\n[1436.3s] only begotten son which is in the bosom\n[1437.9s] of the father he had declared him John 1\n[1440.6s] 12 and verse 18.\n[1443.8s] we can trace the line of the world's\n[1445.6s] great teachers as far back as human\n[1447.1s] record extends okay we can trace back\n[1451.4s] the line\n[1453.3s] okay\n[1454.8s] and see there was great teachers as far\n[1456.9s] back as human records extend but the\n[1458.4s] light was before them\n[1459.9s] so the Highlight was before before them\n[1462.7s] okay\n[1465.0s] and we're told as the moon and the stars\n[1468.8s] of the solar system Shine by The\n[1470.2s] reflected light of the Sun so as far as\n[1472.7s] their teaching is truth do the world's\n[1474.7s] great thinkers reflect the Rays of the\n[1476.5s] son of righteousness\n[1477.9s] okay all of them got their knowledge and\n[1481.5s] wisdom from the one who is higher just\n[1484.2s] like the sun reflects its rays are\n[1486.9s] bounces Rays upon the solar system so we\n[1489.7s] are told that every Gem of thought every\n[1492.1s] flash of the intellect is from the light\n[1493.7s] of the world in these days we hear much\n[1496.3s] about higher education the true higher\n[1498.8s] education is that impacted by him in\n[1501.1s] whom are heed all Treasures of the with\n[1502.9s] of the will of wisdom and knowledge in\n[1505.3s] him was life and the life was the\n[1507.2s] highlight of men Colossians 2 3 and John\n[1509.8s] chapter 1 verse 4.\n[1511.8s] could he that followeth me would say\n[1514.8s] Jesus shall not work in darkness but\n[1516.6s] shall have the light of life and quote\n[1518.2s] the server is 464 paragraph four we are\n[1521.7s] told that true education is to be\n[1526.1s] established in the last days\n[1529.1s] through education\n[1531.1s] medical missionaries\n[1533.2s] centers of influence must be established\n[1535.7s] in the last days in order\n[1538.3s] for you and me to overcome the Beast and\n[1541.0s] the image please scroll the wall of my\n[1544.8s] that Facebook you will see a study on\n[1547.7s] how to overcome the Beast and how to\n[1549.6s] overcome His Image and how

us and\n[1572.6s] has brought us\n[1574.3s] to his side\n[1576.1s] how did he do that\n[1577.8s] that is to the to be the question of to\n[1580.8s] education\n[1582.1s] thank you be welcome in all

few of the propess followers of the reformers are actuated by their Spirit few are listening for the voice of God and ready to accept truth in whatsoever guys it may be presented often those who follow in the steps of the reformers are forced to turn away from the churches they love in order to declare the plain teaching of the word of God and many times those who are seeking for light are by
