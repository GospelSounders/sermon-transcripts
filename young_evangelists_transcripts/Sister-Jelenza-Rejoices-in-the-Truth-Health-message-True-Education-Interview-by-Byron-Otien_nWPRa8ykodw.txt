FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Welcome back. Welcome back uh to all lovers of Young Evangelist Ministry and also to all that are first time viewers in this channel. I want to inform you that the Bible convention 2025 is ongoing and uh this is our second week and we are terminating it coming this Sabbath. It has been a beautiful uh Bible convention and uh our theme is uh the youth must decide for himself. Our key verse is 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 25 and the dim song is song 523. I need no any other evidence. And therefore it means that each and every youth, each and every woman, each and every child that is going to come out of this convention is going not to need any other evidence because it is enough that Jesus died and uh saved us. Now today, as I had promised yesterday, I'm having a guest with me and uh she's going to give us her little testimony, her little experience, what she uh she have learned so far in this uh one and a half week that we've been having here in this convention. So allow me to welcome my guest whom I'm having. She's going to introduce herself. Uh so I have my guest today and it is another moment that you really need to hear from her that the gospel is spreading and much is still coming more people are coming are calling them in the gospel. So my sister studio young evangelist ministry and uh feel most welcome you get yourself composed and speak to those people who are listening to us online. It's in a special way you can introduce yourself and tell them your name and maybe where you come from and also as we shall progress. I know you have a lot to tell to those people who are listening to us. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you. Uh my name is Jenza. I come from um I'm a member of the oldest church which I've joined recently and I'm very glad to be here. I really thank God for this. All right. Thank you sister Jalenza. Uh I would like to know that uh uh is this your first convention to join with young evangelist ministry? Yes, it is my first. Oh, all right. All right. Thank you. Now uh being that uh it is your first convention, how is your experience so far since you came uh to to this convention? How is your experience? How are the things working with you? Uh my experience is good and I really appreciate the fact that I've been able to meet new cases and even learn a lot of things. Uh I've been able to learn from a lot of things. Very many things. Yeah. I can just mention some of them. Mhm. Like matters to do with two meals per day. It's not very easy because the way it was presented unto us, it seems to be very difficult. But the way I've seen it being done here, it's very easy and by the grace of God, I think all is possible. And also uh I've also come to get to know a lot of truths that I'm really willing wishing that if God could give me strength, I would be able to present them to my fellow especially to my family. All right. Thank you. Thank you so much. Uh viewers, I think you can uh get to understand that uh when it comes to health, it's it is something that is very broad and uh there is a challenge in con in in this convention that two meals is possible and that is what we are working with and it is what has made us to be very healthy. I think as you can see our face are shining meaning that two meals is workable. Praise God. Now, uh, Sister Jalenza, maybe you can tell the viewers some of the truth that are standing out for you that, uh, they have been hidden for long, but by God's grace, you've been in a position to come to their realization. Actually, the truths that have come into, most of them, I've heard of them, but the problem is that they're being presented in a certain way that seems so difficult for someone to accept the one that I said concerning two meals especially I really didn't think it was that way because the way it was presented unto me last year it was so difficult and also matters to do with education and following the thing that um the youth must decide for himself we really need to decide in matters to do education and I know it's not easy but all is possible with God and also we also learned about matter sportship yeah and uh um due to the age that we've reached right now I think it's very important for us to get to know that yeah about also church heritage I really got encouraged listening to the stories of people like Ellen White James White and even his death, what caused his death and the age that he died. And it's a challenge to me, a very big challenge. And it's really makes it makes me to question myself whether I'm I'm really doing something where am I I am. All right. All right. Thank you, Sister Jalenza, for that. So, uh, for those who are following, you can subscribe there. You can like, you can share this uh powerful testimony and I know that God is doing something. So maybe to bring this to a close uh sister uh remind viewers where you said you come from so that uh uh uh we may see because uh I don't know whether a gospel like this has reached home or you have a special request for the ministry so that uh the gospel may reach the parents the gospel may reach your village mates the gospel may reach your hometown and maybe uh h any other place that uh you are closely connected with that you wish the gospel to reach. Thank you. Mhm. My place that is Karungu. I really wish that the gospel reaches that place. And uh also my hometown that is sorry. Mhm. Um also in Homer Bay especially because that is where I spend most of my time. Yeah. All right. So uh our viewers it is apparent that the gospel is expanding. So we have a solemn mission in Karungu and I know that by God's grace it is going to be organized so that in Jalenza's place also the gospel to reach so that the world to be warned when this probation is still lingering. We request a special support from you so that may help the ministry to expand to expand its borders. The other day we were having a brother from SIA. Today we are having a sister from Homa. Home has many places that are still untouched and people are still dying in darkness. So I know by God's grace for those who love the truth and those who are viewing for the first time, I know that you are going to respond positively. You can uh uh follow us also in our in our Facebook channel. We have a Facebook uh Facebook group that we post our things and also we do our things. You can follow us and also you can subscribe and hit that bell so that anytime we have an activity like this you can actually be notified and also we have uh the videos about this convention.

[1.4s] Welcome back. Welcome back
[4.1s] uh to all lovers of Young Evangelist

[14.3s] inform you that the Bible convention
[17.8s] 2025 is ongoing and uh this is our
[21.8s] second week and we are terminating it
[26.1s] coming this Sabbath. It has been a
[29.1s] beautiful uh Bible
[31.3s] convention and uh our theme is uh the
[35.3s] youth must decide for himself. Our key
[38.7s] verse is 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse
[42.3s] 25 and the dim song is song
[47.2s] 523. I need no any other evidence. And
[51.2s] therefore it means that each and every
[53.4s] youth, each and every woman, each and
[56.2s] every child that is going to come out of
[57.9s] this convention is going not to need any
[61.4s] other evidence because it is enough that

[88.6s] guest whom I'm having. She's going to
[90.6s] introduce
[91.8s] herself. Uh so I have my guest today and
[96.7s] it is another moment that you really
[99.8s] need to hear from her that the gospel is
[103.2s] spreading and much is still coming more
[106.8s] people are coming are calling them in
[108.4s] the gospel. So my
[112.3s] sister studio young evangelist
[115.2s] ministry and uh feel most welcome you
[119.2s] get yourself composed and speak to those
[121.4s] people who are listening to us online.
[124.4s] It's in a special way you can introduce
[126.1s] yourself and tell them your name and
[129.2s] maybe where you come from and also as we
[133.5s] shall progress. I know you have a lot to
[136.2s] tell to those people who are listening
[137.9s] to us. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you. Uh
[140.9s] my name is
[142.2s] Jenza. I come from
[146.0s] um I'm a member of the oldest
[149.2s] church which I've joined
[151.6s] recently and I'm very glad to be here. I
[154.9s] really thank God for this.
[158.9s] All right. Thank you sister Jalenza. Uh
[162.6s] I would like to know that
[165.6s] uh uh is this your first convention to
[168.1s] join with young evangelist ministry?
[170.6s] Yes, it is my first.
[173.1s] Oh, all right. All right. Thank you. Now
[175.7s] uh being that uh it is your first
[177.9s] convention, how is your experience so
[180.0s] far since you came uh to to this
[183.4s] convention? How is your experience? How
[185.1s] are the things working with you?
[187.9s] Uh my experience is
[190.6s] good and I really appreciate the fact
[193.0s] that I've been able to meet new cases
[195.0s] and even learn a lot of things.
[199.2s] Uh I've been able to learn from a lot of
[202.0s] things. Very many things. Yeah. I can
[205.8s] just mention some of them. Mhm. Like
[208.5s] matters to do with two meals per day.
[212.2s] It's not very easy because the way it
[214.8s] was presented unto us, it seems to be
[217.2s] very difficult. But the way I've seen it
[218.8s] being done here, it's very easy and by
[222.2s] the grace of God, I think all is
[224.8s] possible.
[226.3s] And also
[228.4s] uh I've also come to get to know a lot
[231.1s] of truths that I'm really willing
[234.0s] wishing that if God could give me
[236.2s] strength, I would be able to present
[238.2s] them to my fellow especially to my
[240.4s] family.
[241.5s] All right. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[243.7s] Uh viewers, I think you can uh get to
[247.1s] understand that uh when it comes to
[249.8s] health, it's it is something that is
[252.2s] very broad and uh there is a challenge
[256.2s] in con in in this convention that two
[258.9s] meals is possible and that is what we
[260.9s] are working with and it is what has made
[263.4s] us to be very healthy. I think as you
[265.9s] can see our face are shining meaning
[268.2s] that two meals is workable. Praise God.
[271.9s] Now, uh, Sister Jalenza, maybe you can
[275.1s] tell the viewers some of the truth that
[276.9s] are standing out for you that, uh, they
[281.1s] have been hidden for long, but by God's
[284.4s] grace, you've been in a position to come
[287.5s] to their realization.
[291.1s] Actually, the truths that have come
[293.3s] into, most of them, I've heard of them,
[296.3s] but the problem is that they're being
[298.1s] presented in a certain way that seems so
[300.7s] difficult for someone to accept the one
[303.8s] that I said concerning two meals
[306.3s] especially I really didn't think it was
[308.3s] that way because the way it was
[309.8s] presented unto me last year it was so
[313.2s] difficult and also matters to do with
[318.0s] education and following the thing that
[322.3s] um the youth must decide for
[325.8s] himself we really need to decide in
[328.2s] matters to do education and I know it's
[330.6s] not easy but all is possible with God
[334.1s] and
[334.8s] also we also learned about matter
[337.4s] sportship yeah and uh
[341.9s] um due to the age that we've reached
[344.9s] right now I think it's very important
[348.2s] for us to get to know that yeah about
[351.9s] also church heritage I really got
[354.6s] encouraged listening to the stories of
[357.0s] people like Ellen White James White and
[359.8s] even his death, what caused his death
[362.1s] and the age that he died. And it's a
[364.9s] challenge to me, a very big
[368.0s] challenge. And it's really
[370.8s] makes it makes me to question myself
[373.5s] whether I'm I'm really doing something
[376.2s] where am I I am. All right. All right.
[379.8s] Thank you, Sister Jalenza, for that. So,
[383.1s] uh, for those who are following, you can
[384.5s] subscribe there. You can like, you can
[386.9s] share this uh powerful testimony and I
[389.9s] know that God is doing something. So
[391.6s] maybe to bring this to a close uh sister
[394.4s] uh remind viewers where you said you
[396.2s] come from so that uh uh uh we may see
[399.5s] because uh I don't know whether a gospel
[402.1s] like this has reached home or you have a
[404.8s] special request for the ministry so that
[407.4s] uh the gospel may reach the parents the
[410.6s] gospel may reach your village mates the
[412.6s] gospel may reach your hometown and maybe
[416.0s] uh h any other place that uh you are
[419.4s] closely connected with that you wish the
[421.4s] gospel to reach. Thank you. Mhm.
[425.8s] My place that is Karungu. I really wish
[428.6s] that the gospel reaches that place. And
[431.4s] uh also my hometown that is sorry. Mhm.
[434.8s] Um also in Homer Bay especially because
[438.0s] that is where I spend most of my time.
[440.4s] Yeah.
[442.3s] All right. So uh our
[445.2s] viewers it is apparent that the gospel
[449.3s] is
[450.8s] expanding. So we have a solemn mission
[453.9s] in Karungu and I know that by God's
[457.0s] grace it is going to be organized so
[459.4s] that in Jalenza's place also the gospel
[462.5s] to
[463.2s] reach so that the world to be warned
[466.0s] when this probation is still lingering.
[470.0s] We request a special support from you so
[473.7s] that may help the ministry to expand to
[477.1s] expand its borders. The other day we
[479.4s] were having a brother from SIA. Today we
[482.3s] are having a sister from Homa.
[484.9s] Home has many places that are still
[489.0s] untouched and people are still dying in
[492.3s] darkness. So I know by God's grace for
[494.2s] those who love the truth and those who
[495.8s] are viewing for the first time, I know
[497.1s] that you are going to respond
[498.2s] positively. You can uh uh follow us also
[501.9s] in our in our Facebook channel. We have
[505.8s] a Facebook uh Facebook group that we
[508.9s] post our things and also we do our
[511.0s] things. You can follow us and also you
[513.7s] can subscribe and hit that bell so that
[516.3s] anytime we have an activity like this
[518.9s] you can actually be notified and also we
[521.9s] have uh the
[524.0s] videos about this convention. They were
[527.0s] being recorded and most of them are
[529.0s] online. You can also uh uh watch them
[532.6s] full videos. They're in series. You can
[535.0s] watch them. You can like, you can share.
[537.7s] And also do your comments. Post your
[539.6s] question. Anything that is still
[541.6s] disturbing you, any truth that we are
[543.2s] still not getting well by God's grace,
[545.1s] just post them and we will actually
[548.9s] uh answer them. Otherwise, sister uh

[588.0s] your probation is close I'm not saying
[589.7s] that you hurry up because your probation
[592.0s] will be closed because that one you also
[593.7s] be acting out of fear but you should be
[596.1s] acting out of the love of God
[599.2s] um what you should know is that it's
[601.7s] either heaven cost you everything or
