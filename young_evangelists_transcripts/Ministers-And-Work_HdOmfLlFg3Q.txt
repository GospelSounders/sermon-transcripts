Our second session was on what? Yes. On talents. Can you remember that? So session two we covered the talents and on spiritual gift and talents. It was for those endorsements which we've been given both spiritually, naturally or acquired. You remember that that the Lord requires that all our talents be brought. You remember some of the talents? What did we say? One time, speech, health, strength, influence, etc., etc. Now that was day two, talents. Day three, what did we talk about? Yes. The Bible and work. Amen. Do you remember that? You don't seem to remember. I'm very sorry and sad at the same time that you can't remember. Then we went to session number four. What did we cover on session number four? Yes. Self-support work proper session one. And we took the gospel options. We talked about sections in the gospel which are the gospel in themselves yet they can help us in support. We mentioned things like medical, missionary, publishing and media. You remember that right? You just agree that that's the thing. Then we went to session number five. Now that one is easier for you to guess. What was session number five? Yes. self-support proper number two right and we talked about secular innocent occupation which we could have given them they do not the goal principle and the gospel in the mention things like agriculture and do what yeah we say technical options like carpentry electrical and etc etc. Then we came to that was session number what number five right? Did I say number five or number six? Then we come to session number six. After self support work proper number two we went to what? Principles of success. Right which we reviewed yesterday. We said principle number one commit to the law. Principle number two pay the tithe. Principle number three be agent. Principle number four, don't make haste. Principle number five, yes, avoid that. Principle number six, keep records. Principle number seven, avoid covetousness, proud and extortion. Amen. That was our session number six. Then we come to session number seven which was yesterday. What did we talk about yesterday? It was an extension of principle. So what was principle number eight? Frugality and economy. And now we sum up and we come to session number eight. By God's grace I have had eight session and this is session number eight. And we are talking about ministers and work. Now you realize that what we have covered so far is applicable to all of us. This session is especially dedicated to those who are ministers and they are operating on gospel work proper. Amen. Let me just see by a show of hands how many of us are ministers. Those who are acknowledged missionaries. Let me see. I mean thank you. Those who are doing the gospel work proper. You understand that? Yeah. You are not um doing your things on the long run with the gospel. Your primary work is the gospel. You understand that if I'm a carpenter, I am doing carpentry while I minister. You understand that? But if I'm a missionary, my missionary work is the primary work. But I can still do other things which can help me as I do missionary work. I'm speaking to that category of people. Amen. Now, I say this session is dedicated to ministers. That doesn't mean the church doesn't need to know it, but it's dedicated to ministers because they are the ones whose um I mean of whom this example is given and so we are talking about ministers and work. Now, today I did not prepare powerpoints. So I'll just be reading from the spirit of prophecy from the book Acts of the Apocus from from page 346 onwards. So I just did some um screenshots and I'll be sharing you can follow from your estates because I'll just be reading continuously. Now I hope by this by the end of this session I can now say the youth must decide for himself. Amen. Because you will have covered a great deal which can make you to make the decisions. No one is to make the decision for anyone. You hear the gospel, apply the principles in your life and embrace the gospel or reject the gospel. That's the work of a minister who stands to teach this chapter three. Laboring under difficulties. Now you know the life of Paul and I. I asked you across the week. I ask you this question again. Was Paul a full-time minister or part-time minister? Full-time minister. And we agree. Now in the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 12 the very last part and chapter 13 which is still the extension of chapter 12 the Bible says that can someone get it get me that verse which says desire the higher what the higher offices. How does it say desire the higher gifts or the greater gifts? No. Is that the one I want? I want the one which says for he set primarily the apostles, secondarily the prophets, then thirdly teachers and then healings. That verse. Did anyone get it? First Corinthians chapter 12. The almost the last part of it. Chapter 12 almost the last verse. It could be the second last or the third last verse. Did you see verse 28? 28. What does it say? Yes. Says and come in the first one. Which one? Apostles. Yes. Then prophets. Teachers. Teachers. Miracles. Miracles. Then gifts of healing, healing, helps, governments, then tongues. Those are eight gifts highlighted there. Which one is the greatest of all those gifts? The Bible has given the order. Apostle is the biggest office. Amen. Then which one is the second biggest gift? Prophet. Then which one is the third biggest gift? Teachers. Amen. I ask you this question. How many apostles are in this church? Any prophet, teacher? So you acknowledge that the gift of a teacher is in this church. And it is gift number three. We may not have the rest of the gifts. Number four, what? Miracles. Miracles. Then five, healings. Healings. Helps. Then helps. Helps means you can easily identify someone in need and you can help them. Amen. It's a gift. Then government. Government means church officers. Those who are doing the administrative work. We need an elder. We need a deacon. We need a cler. You know those administrative work. Amen. I ask you as the manifestation of the spirit being manifested in our church and the spirit divide these gifts severally to whomsoever he will. Amen. So if the gift is given in this church maybe the gift of teaching and not prophecy. Should we complain that the Lord has left us off we do not have a prophet prophet. No we have the gift of teaching at least of helps at least of governments. Amen. How many gifts are those? We may not have miracles and healings and speaking in tongues. But we praise the Lord because he saw heat fit for our church to have teaching and helps and governments. Amen. That's it. And so I ask you now Paul being a missionary had which gift? Apostle is that the highest office? Yeah. Do we agree on that? Amen. So an apostle primarily means someone who is done what? Sent. Amen. Do you understand that? That this is the missionary in the truest sense. He has been sent with a message. Now Paul had that office. But now we want to learn from his example from someone who had the highest office of all the offices the spirit can give to the church and of his conduct in this in relation to work because we are talking about self-support. Amen. and how we can blend these talents to achieve uh the success of the gospel. Now we beginning from 3.6 paragraph one said while Paul was careful to set before his converts the plain teachings of scripture regarding the proper support of the work of God. And while he claimed for himself as a minister of the gospel the power to forbear working that's 1 Corinthians 9:6 a secular employment as a means of self-support yet at various times during his ministry in the great centers of civilization he wrote at handic at handiccraft for his own maintenance amen with the highest gift of the holy spirit which is apostilhip he had the right to forbear to stop working in a secular to commit his life to apostilhip which means to be sent. He had the right to do that. Yet we are told at times he wrote at an handiccraft. He did something with his hands to provide means for himself in the great centers of civilization. Amen. Which centers of civilization did Paul visit? Tell me those major cities which he went. One he was at Antioch the first. Then he went where? Corinth is at the furthest end over the other side. Okay. So do we begin with Corinth? He went to Philippi. He went to Ephesus. He went to Galastia. Is that a city route? Maybe it's a region. Yes. What? What did you say? Macedonia is still a region. Philippia and Corinth are now regions. and Athens are the cities of Macedonia and Corinth and not and Corinth. What did you say? You said Macedonia and Yeah, it's Macedonia, not Macedonia and somewhere else. Okay. But in those centers of civilization, Paul wrote at an anticcraft. He did something with his hands to support himself. Amen. But we are told here he had a right to stop working, but he didn't. Amen. Was he less of an apostle? Yeah, I think we will still read something. We had read this quote. The Jews, among the Jews, physical toil was not thought strange or degrading. So among the Jews, it was not thought like walking is degrading. You know there is a prevailing ideology in our generation that we think walking with our hands is degrading. Right? Once you've completed university, I think again you know I was there some day after coming from the university you feel so hesitant you think people are saying hey you understand you think you are supposed to be doing some higher jobs which are not higher in themselves but because the societ has placed them high. So among the Jews that idea was not there. Working with hands was considered a normal thing. I will just jump that paragraph and go down here. Um before he became a disciple of Christ, Paul had occupied a high position and was not dependent upon manual labor for sports. So you understand and even us you may walking as a n as a doctor as a teacher and all those stuff we have tried before and before you embrace the gospel of Christ and before you become a disciple you not you do not depend on manual on manual labor to support yourself. Yes, but afterward where he had used all his means in furthering the course of time, he resorted at times to his trade to gain a livelihood. Amen. So, not being this prayer for leisure. He was doing it to support his livelihood. He needed it for his livelihood because he had spent everything that he had for the gospel course. Especially was this the case where his motives might have misunderstood. Paul will go to places where his motives of preaching might be misunderstood. What is motive? The reason why you are in a place right sometimes means we are in a place where people can misunderstand our motives. These people might are coming to preach so that and Paul thought it's wise when he go to such places to do something else. It's a testimony here that we have of working with hand instead of supporting labor while preaching the word. So he preaching the word writing the church of believers there he reminded them that he might have some to them and added you remember our travel for laboring night and day because would not be unto any of you. We preach unto you the gospel of God and have favor that he will not be chargeable to the president. Amen. He did that. And he said, "And again in his second epistle to them, he declared he and his laborer while with them had not eaten any man's bread for not." Night and day we work, he wrote that we might not be charged to any organ, not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensemble and to follow. Amen. So Paul did not work. And he says not because they have a right to partake of the means that was provided by the church but because he wanted to give them an example so that Paul may easily say follow me as I follow who I follow Christ man you again apostles is the highest office of all the office of a prophet at the Paul had met those who refused to work with their hands It was this afterward. There are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busy bodies. Now them that are with command exalt by our Lord Jesus Christ, they with what? Quietness they walk and eat their own bread. Amen. Are we still together? So Paul met people who refused to walk with their hands and he wrote afterward that we hear that there are some who walk disorderly. So if you advance the idea that we should not be walking, you are walking disorderly. If you advance the idea of indolence and idleness, you are walking disorderly. And what is the exhaltation? He said with quietness go and walk and eat your own bread. Amen. So we we read that that is 32 paragraph 3. In every age, Satan has sought to impair the efforts of God's servants by introducing into the church a spirit of fanaticism. Says that it was in Paul's day. What's fanaticism? You know what it means to be fanatic? What does that mean? It is Yes. having too much interest into something or too much something that overtakes your normal thoughts. Thank you. I think you got it. It's like advancing fanciful and extreme ideas about something that at the expense of the normal operations of life. Right? That's it. So if you are a football fanatic, you put football ahead of everything. You understand that? Now you got it. And people will say, "Are you a fan of football?" Yeah. Are you a football fanatic? Because fan is the short form of saying a fanatic. You understand that? Yeah, I'm a football fan. You are a fanatic. Too bad for you to be a fanatic. But we are told Satan has sought to impair the efforts of God's servant by introducing into the church a spirit of what? Panaticism. I ask you this question again. Where is the devil introducing the spirit of fanatism into the world or into the church? The spirit of prophecy has said often and often we need to be so careful about the spirit of what? Paththeism. If we embrace a message, we should be guarded because the devil will always be there to make it too extreme. You understand? And that's what was happening with Paul as it was in Paul's day and as it was in later centuries during the time of the reformation Luther and many others who blessed the world by their influence on their faith encountered WS by which the enemy seeks to lead into fanaticism over zas unbalanced and unsanctified minds. Misguided source of thought that the attainment of true holiness carry the mind above all earthly thoughts and leads men to refrain holy from labor. Did you get that statement? Do I need to explain it? So there is a thought that people think that if you must be holy and be a Christian, you need to abstain from walking complete completely. And the spirit of prophecy goes ahead to say others taking extreme views of certain text of scripture have thought that it is a sin to work that Christians should take no thought concerning the temporal welfare of themselves or their families but should devote their lives wholly to spiritual things. So if someone is saying we must not work we must not care about temporal things that one is a fanatical view. Hello Now sorry because you are now robbed the other direction. So and he says you take extreme views of certain texts like which text?

[9.8s] one?
[13.0s] Yes. You

[19.4s] Yes. So day one we covered spiritual
[24.0s] gifts. Was that a
[26.6s] tool? Our second session was on
[31.1s] what?
[34.4s] Yes. On
[36.5s] talents. Can you remember that? So
[39.8s] session two we covered the talents and

[114.9s] themselves yet they can help us in
[117.4s] support. We mentioned things like
[119.4s] medical, missionary, publishing and
[121.1s] media. You remember
[122.5s] that right? You just agree that that's
[125.3s] the thing. Then we went to session
[127.5s] number
[128.4s] five. Now that one is easier for you to
[131.0s] guess. What was session number
[134.0s] five? Yes.
[139.2s] self-support proper number two right and
[143.1s] we talked about secular innocent
[146.4s] occupation which we could have given
[148.6s] them they do not the goal
[150.9s] principle and the gospel in the mention
[155.0s] things
[156.2s] like
[158.6s] agriculture and do
[161.2s] what yeah we say technical options like
[164.8s] carpentry
[167.3s] electrical and etc etc. Then we came to
[171.8s] that was session number what number five
[174.3s] right? Did I say number five or number
[177.2s] six? Then we come to session number six.
[180.7s] After self support work proper number
[183.2s] two we went to

[189.7s] we reviewed yesterday. We said principle
[191.8s] number one commit to the law. Principle
[194.1s] number two pay the tithe. Principle
[196.6s] number three
[199.3s] be agent. Principle number
[202.5s] four, don't make haste. Principle number
[206.6s] five,
[209.3s] yes, avoid that. Principle number
[214.6s] six, keep records. Principle number
[219.8s] seven, avoid covetousness, proud and
[223.8s] extortion. Amen. That was our session
[226.9s] number six. Then we come to session
[229.1s] number seven which was yesterday. What
[232.0s] did we talk about
[235.5s] yesterday? It was an extension of
[237.8s] principle. So what was principle number
[239.7s] eight?
[242.8s] Frugality and economy. And now we sum up
[247.1s] and we come to session number eight. By
[249.7s] God's grace I have had eight session and
[251.5s] this is session number eight. And we are
[253.3s] talking about ministers and work. Now
[255.8s] you realize that what we have covered so
[257.8s] far is applicable to all of us. This
[260.5s] session is especially dedicated to those
[263.2s] who are ministers and they are operating
[266.4s] on gospel work proper. Amen. Let me just
[270.3s] see by a show of hands how many of us
[272.2s] are
[273.6s] ministers. Those who are acknowledged
[275.8s] missionaries. Let me
[277.6s] see. I
[279.9s] mean thank you. Those who are doing the
[283.4s] gospel work proper. You understand that?
[286.5s] Yeah. You are not um doing your things
[289.3s] on the long run with the gospel. Your
[292.2s] primary work is the gospel. You
[294.5s] understand that if I'm a carpenter, I am
[297.4s] doing carpentry while I minister. You
[299.2s] understand that? But if I'm a
[301.1s] missionary, my missionary work is the
[303.8s] primary work. But I can still do other
[306.3s] things which can help me as I do
[309.3s] missionary work. I'm speaking to that
[312.0s] category of people. Amen. Now, I say
[316.1s] this session is dedicated to ministers.
[320.1s] That doesn't mean the church doesn't
[322.3s] need to know it, but it's dedicated to
[325.6s] ministers because they are the ones
[327.9s] whose
[329.5s] um I mean of whom this example is given
[333.3s] and so we are talking about ministers
[335.8s] and work. Now, today I did not prepare
[338.6s] powerpoints. So I'll just be reading
[340.6s] from the spirit of prophecy from the
[342.8s] book Acts of the Apocus from from page
[346.4s] 346 onwards. So I just did some
[351.8s] um screenshots and I'll be sharing you
[355.0s] can follow from your estates because
[357.1s] I'll just be reading continuously.
[362.0s] Now I hope by this by the end of this
[365.3s] session I can now
[367.2s] say the
[370.3s] youth must decide for himself. Amen.
[375.6s] Because you will have covered a great
[377.0s] deal which can make you to make the
[379.3s] decisions. No one is to make the
[380.9s] decision for anyone. You hear the
[383.2s] gospel, apply the principles in your
[385.6s] life and embrace the gospel or reject
[388.2s] the gospel. That's the work of a
[389.8s] minister who stands to teach this
[392.9s] chapter three. Laboring under
[394.6s] difficulties. Now you know the life of
[396.4s] Paul and I. I asked you across the week.
[399.0s] I ask you this question again. Was Paul
[402.9s] a full-time minister or part-time
[407.6s] minister? Full-time minister. And we
[409.8s] agree. Now in the book of 1 Corinthians
[413.4s] chapter 12 the very last part and
[415.8s] chapter 13 which is still the extension
[418.0s] of chapter 12 the Bible says
[422.0s] that can someone get it get me that
[424.8s] verse which
[426.9s] says
[429.4s] desire the higher what the higher
[431.6s] offices. How does it say desire the
[433.3s] higher gifts or the greater
[438.4s] gifts? No. Is that the one I want? I
[441.1s] want the one which says for he set
[444.3s] primarily the apostles, secondarily the
[447.0s] prophets, then thirdly teachers and then
[451.3s] healings. That verse. Did anyone get it?
[457.6s] First Corinthians chapter 12. The almost
[461.2s] the last part of
[463.0s] it. Chapter
[465.0s] 12 almost the last verse. It could be
[467.7s] the second last or the third last verse.
[470.2s] Did you see
[472.4s] verse 28? 28. What does it say?
[476.9s] Yes.
[482.0s] Says and come in the first one. Which
[486.7s] one? Apostles. Yes.
[490.5s] Then prophets. Teachers. Teachers.
[494.1s] Miracles. Miracles. Then gifts of
[496.5s] healing,
[497.6s] healing, helps, governments,
[502.5s] then tongues. Those are eight gifts
[505.0s] highlighted there. Which one is the
[507.0s] greatest of all those
[508.8s] gifts? The Bible has given the order.
[512.6s] Apostle is the biggest office. Amen.
[515.4s] Then which one is the second biggest
[517.0s] gift?
[518.6s] Prophet. Then which one is the third
[520.1s] biggest gift? Teachers. Amen. I ask you
[524.6s] this question. How many apostles are in
[526.2s] this
[527.9s] church? Any
[530.0s] prophet,
[531.9s] teacher? So you acknowledge that the
[534.2s] gift of a teacher is in this church. And
[537.0s] it is gift number three. We may not have
[540.4s] the rest of the gifts. Number four,
[541.8s] what?
[543.6s] Miracles. Miracles. Then five, healings.
[547.2s] Healings.
[549.4s] Helps. Then helps. Helps means you can
[552.1s] easily identify someone in need and you
[553.9s] can help them. Amen. It's a gift. Then
[556.4s] government. Government means church
[557.9s] officers. Those who are doing the
[560.1s] administrative work. We need an elder.
[561.9s] We need a deacon. We need a cler. You
[563.3s] know those administrative work. Amen. I
[566.3s] ask you as the manifestation of the
[568.8s] spirit being manifested in our church
[573.5s] and the spirit divide these gifts
[576.6s] severally to whomsoever he will. Amen.
[580.2s] So if the gift is given in this church
[582.6s] maybe the gift of teaching and not
[584.1s] prophecy. Should we complain that the
[585.8s] Lord has left us off we do not have a
[587.5s] prophet prophet. No we have the gift of
[590.3s] teaching at least of helps at least of
[592.7s] governments. Amen. How many gifts are
[594.7s] those? We may not have miracles and
[597.4s] healings and speaking in tongues. But we
[599.1s] praise the Lord because he saw heat fit
[601.6s] for our church to have teaching and
[603.9s] helps and governments. Amen. That's it.
[606.9s] And so I ask you now Paul being a
[611.2s] missionary had which gift?
[615.1s] Apostle is that the highest office?
[617.7s] Yeah. Do we agree on that? Amen.
[622.0s] So an
[623.7s] apostle primarily means someone who is
[626.9s] done what? Sent. Amen.
[636.2s] Do you understand that? That this is the
[638.6s] missionary in the truest sense. He has
[642.7s] been sent with a message. Now Paul had
[645.7s] that office. But now we want to learn
[647.8s] from his example from someone who had
[650.5s] the highest office of all the offices
[652.9s] the spirit can give to the church and of
[656.0s] his conduct in this in relation to work
[658.8s] because we are talking about
[659.8s] self-support. Amen. and how we can blend
[663.0s] these talents to achieve uh the success
[667.0s] of the gospel. Now we beginning from 3.6
[669.3s] paragraph one said while Paul was
[671.8s] careful to set before his converts the
[673.8s] plain teachings of scripture regarding
[676.4s] the proper support of the work of God.
[680.1s] And while he claimed for himself as a
[682.2s] minister of the gospel the power to
[683.8s] forbear working that's 1 Corinthians 9:6
[686.9s] a secular employment as a means of
[688.9s] self-support yet at various times during
[691.2s] his ministry in the great centers of
[692.9s] civilization he wrote at handic at
[696.0s] handiccraft for his own maintenance
[699.1s] amen with the highest gift of the holy
[702.6s] spirit which is
[703.8s] apostilhip he had the right to forbear
[707.3s] to stop working in a secular
[710.0s] to commit his life to apostilhip which
[714.5s] means to be sent. He had the right to do
[717.2s] that. Yet we are told at times he wrote
[721.7s] at an handiccraft. He did something with
[723.8s] his hands to provide means for himself
[727.7s] in the great centers of civilization.
[729.8s] Amen. Which centers of civilization did
[732.3s] Paul visit? Tell me those major cities
[734.6s] which he went.
[736.0s] One he was at Antioch the first. Then he
[738.8s] went
[740.0s] where? Corinth is at the furthest end
[742.7s] over the other side. Okay. So do we
[744.7s] begin with Corinth?
[749.4s] He went to Philippi. He went to
[752.4s] Ephesus. He went to Galastia. Is that a
[755.1s] city route? Maybe it's a region.
[758.7s] Yes. What? What did you say? Macedonia
[761.9s] is still a region. Philippia and Corinth
[763.7s] are now regions. and Athens are the
[766.2s] cities of Macedonia and Corinth and not
[769.3s] and Corinth. What did you say? You said
[771.3s] Macedonia
[773.0s] and Yeah, it's Macedonia, not Macedonia
[775.8s] and somewhere else. Okay. But in those
[778.2s] centers of civilization,
[780.4s] Paul wrote at an anticcraft. He did
[783.3s] something with his hands to support
[784.8s] himself. Amen. But we are told here he
[787.4s] had a right to stop
[790.5s] working, but he didn't. Amen.
[794.7s] Was he less of an
[796.7s] apostle? Yeah, I think we will still
[798.7s] read something. We had read this quote.
[801.3s] The Jews, among the Jews, physical toil
[804.0s] was not thought strange or degrading. So
[806.7s] among the Jews, it was not thought like
[809.1s] walking is degrading. You know there is
[811.9s] a prevailing ideology in our generation
[815.4s] that we think walking with our hands is
[819.6s] degrading. Right? Once you've completed
[822.4s] university,
[841.8s] I think again you know I was there some
[844.4s] day after coming from the university you
[846.8s] feel so hesitant you think people are
[849.8s] saying
[853.7s] hey you understand you think you are
[857.1s] supposed to be doing some higher jobs
[860.5s] which are not higher in themselves but
[862.5s] because the societ
[863.7s] has placed them high. So among the Jews
[867.3s] that idea was not there. Working with
[870.0s] hands was considered a normal thing. I
[873.0s] will just jump that paragraph and go
[874.7s] down
[875.7s] here.
[877.5s] Um before he became a disciple of
[880.8s] Christ, Paul had occupied a high
[883.0s] position and was not dependent upon
[885.4s] manual labor for sports. So you
[888.5s] understand and even us you may walking
[891.8s] as a n as a doctor as a teacher and all
[894.6s] those stuff we have tried before and
[897.4s] before you embrace the gospel of Christ
[899.7s] and before you become a disciple you not
[902.4s] you do not depend on manual on manual
[906.2s] labor to support yourself.
[910.0s] Yes, but afterward where he had used all
[913.9s] his means in furthering the course of
[916.2s] time, he resorted at times to his trade
[919.5s] to gain a livelihood.
[921.2s] Amen. So, not being this
[924.5s] prayer for leisure. He was doing it to
[928.2s] support his livelihood. He needed it for
[931.0s] his livelihood because he had spent
[934.6s] everything that he had for the gospel
[937.5s] course. Especially was this the
[940.0s] case where his motives might have
[943.6s] misunderstood. Paul will go to places
[946.1s] where his motives of preaching might be
[949.8s] misunderstood. What is
[952.8s] motive? The reason why you are in a
[955.1s] place right sometimes means we are in a
[958.6s] place where people can misunderstand our
[962.6s] motives. These people might are coming
[964.4s] to preach so
[966.9s] that and Paul thought
[970.4s] it's wise when he go to such places to
[974.5s] do something else. It's a testimony here
[977.1s] that we have of working with hand
[980.3s] instead of supporting labor while
[982.0s] preaching the word. So
[984.7s] he preaching the
[987.6s] word writing the church of believers
[990.6s] there he reminded them that he might
[992.6s] have some to them and added you remember
[997.1s] our travel for laboring night and day
[1002.5s] because would not be unto any of you. We
[1006.0s] preach unto you the gospel of God and
[1009.8s] have
[1016.3s] favor that he will not be chargeable to
[1020.0s] the
[1030.8s] president. Amen. He did that. And he
[1033.9s] said, "And again in his second epistle
[1035.9s] to them, he declared he and his laborer
[1039.4s] while with them had not eaten any man's
[1042.6s] bread for
[1044.1s] not." Night and day we work, he wrote
[1047.9s] that we might not be charged to any
[1049.9s] organ, not because we have not power,
[1052.9s] but to make ourselves an ensemble and to
[1056.2s] follow. Amen. So Paul did not work. And
[1061.2s] he says not because they have a right to
[1064.1s] partake of the means that was provided
[1066.6s] by the church but because he wanted to
[1068.6s] give them an example so that Paul may
[1071.8s] easily say follow me as I follow who I
[1075.6s] follow Christ
[1077.4s] man you again apostles is the highest
[1081.0s] office of
[1082.2s] all the office of a prophet at the Paul
[1086.9s] had met those who refused to work with
[1089.4s] their hands
[1091.0s] It was this afterward. There are some
[1094.6s] which walk among you disorderly, working
[1097.4s] not at all, but are busy bodies. Now
[1101.4s] them that are with command exalt by our
[1104.1s] Lord Jesus Christ, they with what?
[1106.6s] Quietness they walk and eat their own
[1110.0s] bread.
[1110.8s] Amen. Are we still together?
[1114.0s] So
[1114.9s] Paul met people who refused to walk with
[1119.0s] their
[1120.3s] hands and he wrote afterward that we
[1124.4s] hear that there are some who walk
[1126.1s] disorderly. So if you advance the idea
[1129.8s] that we should not be
[1131.5s] walking, you are walking disorderly. If
[1134.8s] you advance the idea of indolence and
[1137.5s] idleness, you are walking disorderly.
[1140.2s] And what is the exhaltation?
[1142.6s] He said with quietness go and walk and
[1146.4s] eat your own bread.
[1154.8s] Amen. So we we read that that
[1159.6s] is 32 paragraph 3. In every age, Satan
[1164.6s] has sought to impair the efforts of
[1166.9s] God's servants by introducing into the
[1170.0s] church a spirit of
[1172.4s] fanaticism. Says that it was in Paul's
[1176.2s] day. What's
[1179.2s] fanaticism? You know what it means to be
[1181.9s] fanatic? What does that
[1184.3s] mean? It is Yes.
[1192.7s] having too much interest into something
[1196.3s] or too much something that overtakes
[1200.0s] your normal thoughts.
[1202.2s] Thank you. I think you got it. It's like
[1205.4s] advancing fanciful and extreme ideas
[1208.3s] about something that at the expense of
[1211.6s] the normal operations of life. Right?
[1214.1s] That's it. So if you are a football
[1216.0s] fanatic, you put football ahead of
[1219.7s] everything. You understand that? Now you
[1222.6s] got it. And people will say, "Are you a
[1224.7s] fan of
[1226.2s] football?" Yeah. Are you a football
[1228.5s] fanatic? Because fan is the short form
[1230.5s] of saying a fanatic. You understand
[1232.6s] that? Yeah, I'm a football fan. You are
[1235.8s] a
[1236.6s] fanatic. Too bad for you to be a
[1239.1s] fanatic. But we are told Satan has
[1242.9s] sought to impair the efforts of God's
[1244.6s] servant by introducing into the church a
[1246.4s] spirit of what? Panaticism. I ask you
[1248.9s] this question again. Where is the devil
[1251.6s] introducing the spirit of fanatism into
[1254.8s] the world or into the
[1256.3s] church? The spirit of prophecy has said
[1258.6s] often and often we need to be so careful
[1260.7s] about the spirit of what? Paththeism.
[1264.7s] If we embrace a message, we should be
[1267.8s] guarded because the devil will always be
[1270.0s] there to make it too extreme. You
[1272.7s] understand? And that's what was
[1274.7s] happening with Paul as it was in Paul's
[1277.0s] day and as it was in later centuries
[1279.4s] during the time of the
[1281.4s] reformation Luther and many others who
[1284.1s] blessed the world by their influence on
[1286.0s] their faith encountered WS by which the
[1289.0s] enemy seeks to lead into fanaticism over
[1292.2s] zas unbalanced and unsanctified minds.
[1296.8s] Misguided source of thought that the
[1299.5s] attainment of true holiness carry the
[1301.9s] mind above all earthly thoughts and
[1304.4s] leads men to refrain holy from labor.
[1307.5s] Did you get that statement? Do I need to
[1310.2s] explain it? So there is a thought that
[1312.6s] people think that if you must be holy
[1315.4s] and be a Christian, you need to abstain
[1317.0s] from walking complete completely. And
[1320.2s] the spirit of prophecy goes ahead to say
[1322.6s] others taking extreme views of certain
[1325.0s] text of scripture have thought that it
[1327.6s] is a sin to work that Christians should
[1330.4s] take no thought concerning the temporal
[1332.3s] welfare of themselves or their families
[1335.0s] but should devote their lives wholly to
[1337.4s] spiritual things. So if someone is
[1340.8s] saying we must not work we must not care
[1343.3s] about temporal things that one is a
[1345.7s] fanatical
[1347.6s] view. Hello
[1350.5s] Now sorry because you are now robbed the
[1353.8s] other
[1355.2s] direction. So and he says you take
[1359.0s] extreme views of certain texts like
[1361.5s] which text?
