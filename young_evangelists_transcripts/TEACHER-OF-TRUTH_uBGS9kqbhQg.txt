FULL TRANSCRIPT:
I'm also a lover of history and when church was being presented I was in Christ by something that I want to read uh I said that I have to read this month before this congregation before I go into the subject moment I'm reading in three three Bible page 174 when the teacher of church. He was talking about somebody called James White. I said that I had to read this thing before this congregation because I loved the characteristics of James White and the God is calling for James White in the last days to be able to carry on the work uh the work that the Lord has left us. That is the work of preaching the news message. There is three bio three biography 4 paragraph 36 I'm commenting about what the teacher said about James White and I'm going to read the funeral program of James White when he died in 188 what James White died 18 which month which date fixed you need to know that now this is Smith who was the secretary of the general conference when James went was working. Uh 374 paragraph 6 says Smith enumerated in some detail giving illustrations predominating traits and characteristics of a man with whom he had worked intimately for so many years. We first noticed that in the times of confusion and excitement he was what? Always calm and cool. Are we together? That is the first characteristics of who? James White. In times of confusion, James White was always calm and what? And cool. We are told. Secondly, he was a man never given to what fanatism. Number three, he was thirdly, he was endured with remarkable acuteness of perception to determine the most delicious moves to be made. Hallelujah. Those are characteristics of whom James went. Fourthly, he was a man who would never to discuss discouragement. And I love that the word fail was not in his what? Vocabul. Hallelujah. God is calling for him today who can never what? Discouragement. Amen. And I see him in the meeting. There are people here the word fail cannot be what vocabulary. Fifthly, he was a man who looked forward to the future ones of his work and make provision for them. He foraw that certain elements stability of stability must be wrote into the work which could be secured only through what? Organization. Sixthly, he was a man of strong personal apprentip of a remarkably generous nature to have a regard for the interest of others and to see that their circumstances were rendered as favorable as possible was a part of his name. Amen. So I love those characteristics of James White. And when the teacher was speaking about James White, I was very impressed by that point and I say I had to read it. But I said that the James White of the last days are going to die up early. And if they are not if they don't die early, it means that they're not what working. I'm still contemplating upon that. If you are against wife in the congregation, do meditate upon that. May God bless the teacher of we shall be talking about that. I know that the Lord has led us in the past we don't fear for the people for the future. Amen. So welcome again to the class of education educator. This class I look on very few things. This class I'm going to give much time for question and answer because I only have two classes that is remaining. In my next class I'll be looking away for a solution in regation and that is what we had looking when last we about the one aim of the purple systemation I realize that the aim of the purple system is to do what to overthrow what to overthrow protestantism I don't know how to say that is in his way but I know that the first aim of the purple and the system of education is to make sure that protestants are destroyed. Realize that papacy does this through the order of Jesuits. Are we together? When was the order of J established? when by whom somebody of them can apply and we have controversy in 234 told us that what they do is that they what they are together they don't visit schools they don't say they establish schools but they They invented the war or dolls prisons get the poor. But for the young children they do what? They they established schools for the what for the common people and the colleges for the children of the princess and by that the children of Protestants were drawn into the observance of popish what popish right that was southern soldiers that the best way to control protestants is just to control their education. Education examples remaining 14. What made me the declaration of the United Nations is that they never understood the true science of what? Education. Hallelujah. And therefore seventh day adventist that was to them an example. Those things were written that they need to be a what? An example that this last days if are not going to understand the two sides of education their information are not going for because they realize that the message and the two of the two And he also realized that the education is the birthight of what of information on a man and I was very happy when the teacher of church heritage was also saying that what is the catalyst of information the catalyst Who are these people in the class? What is the catalyst of reformation? Well, you will tell them the catalyst of reformation is publishing house. And we saw that the present true publishing house was established in year but you were in class and 1850 go. So the catalyst of information is republic publishing. The path right and what strengthens the information is through science of educate education while the right arm of the gospel becomes the what medical missionary. Amen. So those three things that is that we have to maintain our what publishing ourselves schools is going to restaurants. Hallelujah. You will only establish restaurants after establishing house as an school. Hallelujah. Don't run for a restaurant before even establishing one school. Amen. Say amen. Hallelujah. P the B is for information then the right arm that is missionary then you can go for a restaurant. Amen. So in this class I'm going to give very brief notes very brief. and try to be brief and give time for more questions. Now last time we left at the point where we say that we need schools that are going to repudiate the principles of purpose. Hallelujah. I'll take from that in the next class and we'll see how to establish schools, what is to be taught in the schools and also the selection of teachers to teach in the world in the schools. Are we together? So that I want to preserve for the next lesson and my last lesson the topic of my last lesson will be you must be able to decide for himself. Amen. So if the question that we'll be having that be we'll be touching on the how to establish schools what is to be taught in schools and the selection of teachers you can preserve that question for the next class but today I'm going to give generally the questions of all the studies that I've been having in this class. If you had a question, kindly prepare your question because I'm going to eat time. But as for now, I want to begin giving the characteristics of true and the true education and the characteristics of worldly system education. Then I give a few a very brief then I look at two examples only two examples. I look at Christ today and look at the Greek history very brief. then I'll be able to finish my presentation. I'll be very brief. Now write characteristics of true and false system of education. Then we begin with false system education. The book of James 3:3 is what are beginning to read is there is where we are going to pick our characteristics and see them very fast. Somebody is there to help me read. Brother God pray you can just come and sit here use a microphone to help me read these things very fast. And you will also help me project the quotations because those who are sitting there is like they have gone for a short break and they are coming back. So you can fill that position. James 3 and the 13 the Bible says hallelujah 3:1 and you also take your book and write the following. The Bible says James says James 3:3 The Bible says if you have But if you have bitter envy and strive in your heart not do not glory not lie not against and lie not against the truth. This wisdom the wisdom that comprises of envy and strife descended not from above. It descended not from above. And it is earthly it is earthly sensual sensual and devilish and devilish and we saw that that the first method of the district system of education is to make people complete so right of systemation number one it it comprises of beta envy it comprises of beta envy somebody's looking at the wall thinking that they're being projected I'm not going to project them let me Just read them for you in this laptop and write them. It comprises of beta environ. Number two, it promotes strife in the heart. It promotes strife in the heart. Number three, it does not descend from above. Number two, promote strength in the heart. Promote strength in the heart. promote strive in the heart. The next says it, it does not descend from above. Amen. In other words, it does not descend from the father. In the book of John 8:44, we tell you that anything that does not desend from the father comes from who? Satan. Amen. Anything false is satanic. Amen. So it does not descend from above. It is earthly. It is earthly. It is earthly. That is number four. Number five, it is sensual. It is sensual. Number five, it is satanic stroke. Demonic stroke delish. In other words, put in bracket. It makes people worship us. It is a satanic paganism, demonic, devilish. Those are the same things. I'm going to the characteristics of education the book of James chapter 3. You proceed I'll try read the Bible. Uh 3 verse number 15. The Bible says this wisdom this wisdom descendant from above. It does not descend from above it is sensual and deish those ones we have written that is the characteristics of purple system education and world system education or you can still write system of education but realize that we have another kind of education. Now you can also write characteristics of true education. characteristics of truth education. Philippians 3 16 the Bible says it says from ending and strife is there is confusion and every evil one but the wisdom that is from above the wisdom that is from above that is first the first characteristic of true education it descendeth from above write that it descendeth from above it is godly it is godly and promotes Christianity Write that statement that way. It descended from above. It is godly and promotes Christianity. Number two, it is pure. I think the book of James chapter 3 has been projected. It is pure. It is pure. In other words, no unnecessary knowledge. We realize that in the world of education there are necessary what? Knowledge. Amen. And there are things that are taught that should not be taught to Christians today. Today today no unnecessary there's no no any unnecessary knowledge. Number three, it is peaceable. It is peaceable. Write very fast. Write very fast. Time is running. I want to write very fast. It is peaceable. It is gentle. It is peaceable. It is gentle. It is easily treated. Somebody saw that easily in treated full of m is full of nami. It is full of good fruits. It is easily intreated. It is easily intreated. It is full of mer. Full of good fruits. Full of mer. Full of good fruits. without partiality, without hypocrisy. Realize that the worst of education is hypocrisy. It is a form of godliness. You pretend to be loving God, but unite them in works. Without hypocrisy, the fruit of righteousness is sown in its principle. The fields of righteousness is in every characteristics of truth education. Amen. Amen. Education and we say that that is the monique. I'm giving two aims of system education two only. The rest you will go and study for yourself. My first point from the Sabbath was that it it aim is to overthrow what? Protestantism. Number two, write this number two. So if you're writing your I know you write notes on the so if you want to write them just write a purposes then you write continuation then you just write number two are you think it proves the Bible to be error and a theory it proves the Bible to be error and a theory. There was a quotation by was read that was read by brother Neon I think it was ministry of it should be page 443 maybe I'm going to check the page I give but it says that philosophical speculation and scientific research philosophical speculation and scientific research in which God is not acknowledged are making skeptics of thousands in the schools of today the conclusion that learned men have reached as the result of their scientific investigation are carefully taught and fully explained while the impression is distinctly given that if these learned men are correct the Bible cannot be hallelujah hallelujah so we are told that the theories that are taught in school today evolution if they can be correct then the Bible cannot be correct so one of the aim of the purple education is that it proves the Bible to be error and a theory. So that is why today it makes people not study the Bible because they believe that is an error. It is just a theory what is believed. Amen. Next aim it promotes a self this what we tackled in our last so I'm going to deal with few examples and give questions to this class. It promotes self the root of all evil. It promotes self the root of evil. Education page 225 paragraph 4. Education 225 education page 2.5 says precious the service done and the education gained in carrying out these principles but how widely different is much of the education now given from the child's earliest years is an appeal of emulation and rivalry of emulation and what that is. So we are told that it fosters selfishness the root of all evil page paragraph 4. It is not from the beginning. It was taken just the last part where it says that precious the service done and the education gained in carrying out the princip this principles but how widely different is much of the education now given from the child's earliest years that fosters selfishness the root of all what all evil allow me repeat this quotation that was uh testing church 3 page 384 paragraph 3 I think that is the reputation says the following words 384 paragraph 3 384 paragraph number three says it says it says when the lamb and the takes position of the heart and becomes a ruling passion Mhm. That is not what I want. What I want say is under the general heading of selfishness came every other scene. That is what I'm looking for today because the system of education of today strengthens what? Selfishness. Let me check if it is this one. volume 4 paragraph 3 I'm sorry not speech says that another book was opened wherein were recording the saints of those who profess the truth under the general heading of selfishness came every other sin there were also headings over every column and these opposite each names were recorded in their respective columns the lesser saints so what I wanted you to understand that in this systemation promoting came in other words the system of education the worldly system of education promotes what sin sle can someone overcome sin with that system of education no is very is impossible but the grace of god is sufficient for those we decide to make decision decision. So it is also like this. It is also idol worshiping is also idle worshiing. This takes me to the great green history very fast green very fast. And I'm reading SDP SDP. This is page uh SDP page uh let me get the page page 80. Get this. I was to look at this green history very deeply but time is not going to allow me to give that because I already see I have 40 minutes but I wanted to give a good time to questions and answer this page 181 182 paragraph one says the following I want to be projected to see that system of education is idol woriing you are not woriing god why system ofation However much we come to the church on Sabbath and we go back and we prepare meals on Friday. Hallelujah. I want to see that. I want to see that. 1821 1821 says it says there is a pathetic straight throughout their history. They sympathetic straight throughout their history and their history what Greek history are together. What is the characteristics of Greeks that you know they are speaking for what? Wisdom. Hallelujah. But is there wisdom is if Christ is preached they say that is foolishness foolishness. I mean with you in the book of 1 Corinthians 1:21 23. So the Greeks are only seeking for whistle but they all fruit Christ as for foolishness. Hallelujah. But Christians need to have Christ. Are we together? So there's a pathetic strength throughout their history. They come so close to God. They come so close to God. They come so close to they come so close to the God of whom? Uhhuh. And yet not knowing him. And yet not knowing him. They wandered in such utter darkness. Continuing there is a constant reminder of the faith of those students of today. The Greek history is a constant reminder to the students of whom? They seek to understand natural phenomenal they can explain how much kilaro was formed. Are you they know and they have theories that will explain how the world came to exist exist and they can explain how we have seven continents. Amen. And they know what happened between the seas and the land. They can explain. They want to understand natural what phenomena but do what? Continuing. But do not interpret nature. They do not interpret nature. By the words of his creator. By the words of who? His great. Is great. Hallelujah. In other words, the nature should be interpreted by the words of who? Of creator. And the words of creator is in what? The the Bible. Hallelujah. So people understanding the phenomena without the by the way you cannot stud the Bible they go to you told that heaven is a what is a school nature what listen I read that quotation when I was reading that page 547 says that heaven is a what a school so there's the students of today are desiring to understand phenomena but do not interpret nature by the word of the creator. Now listen to the next statement. Hallelujah. Someone who is tired get this next statement. It says they worship who? Zeus and Pluto Pluto instead of instead of the Christ. So if you are answering questions in you idol worship. Yes. The Bible will tell you that you cannot worship two people. No one can serve what two masters. Amen. So when you are coming to the church but in the other hand you what you need to know that you have one master. Are we together? So it is idol should be continue reading the fact that the children of today the fact that the children of today upon myths and tradition of this are fed upon myth and tradition of this very in darkness gods of Olympus and ignorant of God whose shoot the mountains against whose smile was sanding Uh-huh. And whoever the fields, the Greeks, the Greeksh were they accepted the sacrifice of the slain of the lamb of God. Greeks offered what? But we are asked that what value of their sacrifice if they rejected the lamb of God. The system of education today people sacrifice. Amen. And they give offerings that to do what to sacrifice continually saying the spirit of prophecy the spirit of prophecy was cherished was cherished but when God's prophet made the But while God's prophet mingled with the three people, the Greek prophet secluded from the peopleh. Amen. So I don't want you to know that today I'm praying to worship God. Amen. That will be my call. This week is a week of making and we are told that when a call is made and you make a step forward and God is going to give you angels to go to. Amen. So we have people in the in the Bible. We have people in the Bible of whom the word of God was studied. The last we saw in the education of Moses. I want just to reiterate this that Moses studied in who school? In the schools of Egypt. Are we together? And Moses studied very great topics. We saw that Moses was a philosopher. He was a poet. He was a mathematician. And we were told that Moses used to call what? And used to score airplanes not airplanes but when God called Moses he had to under system to get education. Hallelujah. He has to go to God's universe. Hallelujah. Amen. And we are also told not only that I want to read for last one quotation that will summarize the education and last we also saw when they were answering a question a brother asked we realized that there were also schools of prophets in which Daniel's friends to obtain their what education and the education was very high more than the education that was provided in the universities and colleges of what United you reading it again very fast then we come to something I'm just next to coming to the end of my I want to give you time to answer questions the place of Bible 8 page 80 this is a book written by also Trevor a pioneer of 7th Adventist. Now this is page 80 paragraph one project that you see this the schools of the prophets there were schools of the prophets at the same time there also schools of the palants now look at the education that was in the schools of the prophets is it there from the specification distinct remain in the scripture from the specification decision made in the scripture from the product that must be passed. It is certain that all we have of life must comprehend the requirements of the king's respect of the king respecting the youth who are to beh and this no small tribute is no small tribute to the educational ideas of king indeed his views of education in this verse as soon in this verse I'm talking Daniel chapter one chapter one from verse four in this verse of the Bible in this verse of the Bible for all practical purposes for in advance for in advance of the educational system that prevents people the kind of the people that require the education was advanced more than the education that people acquire today today today. Hallelujah. Daniel was very wise. Amen. He was very wise and he qualified to be chosen to serve at the king's what palace. Are we together? Now continue reading even in the living colleges. That prevents even the living and universities. The living is universities where United States not even amened what United States. Amen. That is the wherein that proceed in the paragraph that is paragraph three. It says, it says Daniel, where did Daniel and his three companions and his three companions obtain the education which enable them successfully which enable them successfully to pass the examination to pass the examination require that exist of the leading the leading of United where can that education be acquired? them and education which made them skillful and knowledge and understanding science and understanding what science science and which gave them ability and which they gave them ability in all the things withoutation it can be answered but but I like that place I like that place I want you to see But you see people today are talking of the education. You see these things or these things and maybe education of the world. You see this this cameras, this laptop and and we said last time that not every knowledge is from the what? We realize that Satan with and when God has given a knowledge that will help in the taking the gospel of the message people has to accept that knowledge. Are you so I will read your quotation that says that whosoever staples this conviction because it is what inclinations will soon fail to determine between truth and you are my light no without education can be answered it can be answered in the school of the prophets. In the schools of the what? The prophets. He established school in there was at that time there was at that time a school a school of schools of the prophets in Jerusalem in Jerusalem. Hallelujah. So there were schools of the prophets in Jerusalem. Amen. And you remember during the time when the sons of the prophets were going to cut what? Trees. Where were they? In the school of the prophets. Amen. And they were going to build what classics. Amen. They were going to build classes. Where the hallelujah. So green fields, green history will change you. There is something. Have you ever known why there's a a gap between and have you ever known why a gap that is between Greek history that Greek history answers that then I'm looking just example of Christ I'm giving you time for questions 19 get this Get this why there is an ass time between Malachi and the book of Matthew SDP the page is 190 paragraph this will tell you about the issue that has happened what God had given to his people and what is happening in this last days it says 192 this one is wasting now time let me use this for it has that the inoc the time between the prophecy of Malachi between the prophecy of Malachi and John the Baptist and John the Baptist when is John the history of John the Baptist beginning in the book of Mark Matthew Are you yes continue reading we are now ready we are now ready to appreciate the reason to appreciate The reason Israel why Israel so long was so long without the sound without the sound of the prophet's voice of the prophet's voice God God is a communication system of what education hallelujah how many are seeing the history of the Greece how it appeared in God's word look at this God gave Israel a sense of what education separate and distinct from the system of all other nations. Nations. Hallelujah. So could Israel go to other system of other nations? No. of today. Amen. And we will be putting that verse that is first that we are the people what nations. Uhhuh. Chosen. Chosen what? Is a chosen what? So if the chosen generation seventh day adventist today, God is a separate and distinct the system of all other nation. A system continue a system which ifever would forever make it impossible make it impossible for the people for the people to go into. So they were following it says it says but Israel but Israel gave up a god-given system for teaching for the teaching nation of the hidden what nations. Next it says look at that very painful that however much God gave them a system that was different from all other nations but they gave up to the teachings of other what nations are together they went to another system of what education they copied other nations and allow me tell you how many have ever read the book of numbers chapter 25 chapter 25 what is happening in numbers chapter 25 numbers numbers chapter 25 it was even presented Yeah. Ecumenical movement. Ecumenical what? Movement. Do you know the tribe in Israel that led that? The tribe in that was the tribe of Robert. What to birth? What is the birth of education? The science of what? Education. So we are going to join movement after doing what? Selling our birthight. You go to cross and shadow page 288. That one we read paragraph 3. Go to paragraph 4. Read the next you realize that the tribe of the women were the people who went and choose and stay next to Moabites. Are you together? And by that they selling their what? Their so people are going to sell your true science of others. Okay. If we go to the system of other other gods and other gods today, tell me a school today where one god is taught the schools of the world. We are going to go to captivity and number 25 is going to repeat itself itself. It continuc religion. Hallelujah. No one can go to that education and come up with a pure mind. You know that are also using that verse. I always read you that it is only that time is limited. The first principles of the child. If you turn up a child from 1 to 12 years you will forever. That is what are saying that is written in fundamental of education where books reading go and get that book to read. You see today elders are coming some elders some are coming and say train up a child. So if you are doing with them they will not do what this is worshiping of God but when they went to they came up with religion. But let me ask you those who obtained their education in the schools of the prophets like Daniel were they simulated with that system of education? No. Were they impressed by that religion? No. When you teach Daniel chapter 3, they refused to bow down what to the idol. Are you so going to under go the beast and let the change and the grace of God be sufficient to the unto them. Hallelujah. Somebody is sleeping in this class. Just wake up a man. The grace of God is sufficient to those who sleeping. Hallelujah. So it continues by saying I won't finish. It continues by saying uh Jews return from Babylon. Jews return from Babylon. Babylonian ideas of education and religion. This prepared them with readiness. The teaching of the the teachings of the Greeks. A question. What have we read that the teaching of the Greek is leading to? I do not. I I when somebody is trying to understand phenomena of the earth without the Bible in that age. So they were able to accept the teachings of the Greek. The Greeks continually from Malachi of John the Baptist. family go and read others for yourself. Amen. Amen. By the way, what made you follow the system? But you know, God has arrived to do what worship him. So there were those who remained and remain steadfast to the system. I'm looking up Christ as an example. Then I'm giving time for prayers. Christ as an example. The book of that is first Peter 2 verse 21. The Bible says the following words 2 verse 21 says the Bible reads the reads uh 2 2 Uh-huh. Because Uh-huh. Because Christ also suffered for us. Because Christ also suffered for us. Living as an example. Living as an example. That you should follow. That you should follow what? Yes. That Christ left an example that you should follow what? First John 2 verse 6. It says, It says John 2 verse 6. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. He that he abideth in him. He that he abideth in himself to walk even walk as he walk. Hallelujah. How many love that verse? How many love that verse? And when you can preach that verse, you will talk of Christ humility. Hallelujah. You talk of Christ kindness. Amen. Will you mention that in that verse? Hallelujah. Amen. Will you mention those? But people always mention the Christ. Do we always mention the Christ? But what the Bible says is that we read again. It says it says he that abided him abided in him. God himself to walk him even as he walked. All you want to say so Christ, you talk of Christ, you talk of Christ, you talk of Christy, you talk of Christ verse 28, the Bible say the mans And when they saw him, And when they saw him, they were amazed. They were amazed. And his mother said unto him, And his mother said unto him, Son, why this the Bible? It says, son, why hast thou dealt with us? Behold, thy father and household this. Uhhuh. I'm checking the verse where it says that and the child grew 40. The Bible says the child and the child grew what strong in spirit and what strong in spirit that is Jesus Christ filled with wisdom. Filled with what? Wisdom. Filled with what? Wisdom. Wisdom. And the grace of God was upon you. And the grace of God was upon him. Christ was also filled with what? Wisdom. He now Christ was is our example. And if you're buying in Christ, we need to follow the step of Christ. Look at this. I'm reading this pages page 9 page 7 69 paragraph 3 then I paragraph one then I pray listen to the following words in the in the name of Christ for religious instruction for that that did not provide for religious instruction of the young regard was regarded under of God. Next statement had become for tradition in a great degree supplanted supplanted what? The script. That is the name of Christ. That tradition supplanted the what? The script. Hallelujah. So the only thing that could be lifted is tradition more than script scriptures. Uhhuh. [Music] by these teachers. But the next paragon receive instruction in the synagogue in the synagogue schools in the synagogue schools. His mother was his first human was his first human teacher from the scorn of the mother the mother of Jesus used the syllabus of the education of the prop the schools of the prop the same thing that was taught to Daniel was taught to whom Christ amen that is why Christ was very very wise his wisdom exceeded the wisdom of the universities of United States. Amen. My time is running fast. I want to stop. Amen. So this subject is some sometimes interesting that I begin reading something. I realize that time man. Amen. But God may God be the help follow Christ before those who successfully mission movement in Jesus name. Amen. Allow me then I need time for questions. I'm praying. Thank you for the system education that you given to the Israelites. We also were able to study and their wisdom exed all other wisdom that could be in the world. That is the wisdom we require today as people to make sure that we have a character paid for it. Help us dear Lord in heaven to make a step of faith to do the call that you're doing over us to education. Dear all heaven as you shall be looking other things are to be established. God we pray that you may help us have a people who are going to stand for this for I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.

[123.9s] to what fanatism. Number three, he was
[128.2s] thirdly, he was endured with remarkable
[131.8s] acuteness of perception to determine the
[135.8s] most delicious moves to be made.
[138.5s] Hallelujah. Those are characteristics of
[140.9s] whom James went. Fourthly, he was a man
[144.5s] who would never to discuss
[146.7s] discouragement. And I love that the word
[149.9s] fail was not in his what? Vocabul.
[153.8s] Hallelujah. God is calling for him today
[157.0s] who can never what? Discouragement.
[160.0s] Amen. And I see him in the meeting.
[163.0s] There are people here the word fail
[165.2s] cannot be what vocabulary. Fifthly, he
[169.1s] was a man who looked forward to the
[171.3s] future ones of his work and make
[173.2s] provision for them. He foraw that
[175.5s] certain elements stability of stability
[178.3s] must be wrote into the work which could
[180.8s] be secured only through what?
[183.7s] Organization. Sixthly, he was a man of
[186.9s] strong personal apprentip of a
[189.0s] remarkably generous nature to have a
[191.8s] regard for the interest of others and to
[195.0s] see that their circumstances were
[197.0s] rendered as favorable as possible was a
[200.4s] part of his name. Amen. So I love those
[203.8s] characteristics of James White. And when
[206.1s] the teacher was speaking about James
[207.6s] White, I was very impressed by that
[210.1s] point and I say I had to read it. But I
[212.9s] said that the James White of the last
[215.6s] days are going to die up early. And if
[219.8s] they are not if they don't die early, it
[221.8s] means that they're not what working. I'm
[225.0s] still contemplating upon that. If you
[227.4s] are against wife in the congregation, do
[229.7s] meditate upon that. May God bless the
[232.0s] teacher
[232.9s] of we shall be talking about that. I
[236.1s] know that the Lord has led us in the
[238.6s] past we don't fear for the people for
[241.0s] the future. Amen. So welcome again to
[243.4s] the class of
[246.4s] education educator. This class I look on
[249.8s] very few things. This class I'm going to
[252.4s] give much time for question and answer
[255.8s] because I only have two classes that is
[257.8s] remaining. In my next class I'll be
[260.5s] looking away for a solution in regation
[264.3s] and that is what we had looking when
[266.9s] last we about the one aim of the purple
[271.5s] systemation I realize that the aim of
[273.9s] the purple system is to do what to
[276.8s] overthrow
[278.0s] what to overthrow protestantism I don't
[281.8s] know how to say that is in his way but I
[284.5s] know that the first aim of the purple
[287.7s] and the system of education is to make
[290.2s] sure that protestants are destroyed.
[293.6s] Realize that papacy does this through
[296.6s] the order of Jesuits. Are we together?
[300.3s] When was the order of J established?
[307.9s] when by
[311.6s] whom
[315.3s] somebody of them can apply and we have
[318.1s] controversy in 234 told us that what
[321.2s] they do is that they what
[326.8s] they are together they don't visit
[330.4s] schools they don't say they establish
[332.7s] schools but they They invented the war
[335.5s] or dolls prisons get the poor. But for
[339.8s] the young children they do what? They
[342.9s] they established schools for the what
[345.0s] for the common people and the colleges
[348.1s] for the children of the princess and by
[351.0s] that the children of Protestants were
[354.1s] drawn into the observance of popish what
[357.8s] popish
[358.8s] right that was southern soldiers that
[363.1s] the best way to control protestants is
[366.5s] just to control their
[374.7s] education.
[376.3s] Education examples remaining 14. What
[379.8s] made me the declaration of the United
[381.4s] Nations is that they never understood
[384.0s] the true science of what? Education.
[386.8s] Hallelujah. And therefore seventh day
[389.0s] adventist that was to them an example.
[392.3s] Those things were written that they need
[394.2s] to be a what? An example that this last
[396.7s] days if are not going to understand the
[400.5s] two sides of education their information
[403.1s] are not going
[405.1s] for because they realize that the
[407.8s] message and the two
[421.1s] of
[422.8s] the two
[433.5s] And he also realized that the education
[436.2s] is the birthight of
[439.2s] what of information on a man and I was
[442.5s] very happy when the teacher of church
[445.2s] heritage was also saying that what is
[446.9s] the catalyst of
[448.4s] information the catalyst
[454.3s] Who are these people in the class? What
[456.6s] is the catalyst of reformation? Well,
[458.8s] you will tell them the catalyst of
[460.8s] reformation is publishing house. And we
[463.5s] saw that the present true publishing
[465.6s] house was established in
[467.5s] year but you were in class
[475.8s] and
[477.3s] 1850
[480.9s] go. So the catalyst of information is
[483.7s] republic publishing. The path right and
[487.0s] what strengthens the information is
[489.7s] through science of educate education
[492.1s] while the right arm of the gospel
[493.8s] becomes the what medical missionary.
[496.4s] Amen. So those three things that is that
[499.8s] we have to maintain our what publishing
[502.2s] ourselves
[504.4s] schools is going to restaurants.
[508.8s] Hallelujah. You will only establish
[511.2s] restaurants after establishing house as
[514.1s] an school. Hallelujah. Don't run for a
[517.0s] restaurant before even establishing one
[519.4s] school. Amen. Say amen.
[523.8s] Hallelujah. P the
[526.2s] B is for information then the right arm
[529.4s] that is missionary then you can go for a
[531.7s] restaurant. Amen. So in this class I'm
[533.8s] going to give very brief notes very
[536.7s] brief. and try to be brief and give time
[540.4s] for more questions. Now last time we
[542.4s] left at the point where we say that we
[544.7s] need schools that are going to repudiate
[547.6s] the principles of purpose. Hallelujah.
[552.0s] I'll take from that in the next class
[555.1s] and we'll see how to establish
[558.5s] schools, what is to be taught in the
[561.3s] schools and also the selection of
[564.8s] teachers to teach in the world in the
[568.0s] schools. Are we together? So that I want
[570.1s] to preserve for the next lesson and my
[572.5s] last lesson the topic of my last lesson
[575.0s] will be you must be able to decide for
[579.4s] himself. Amen. So if the question that
[583.2s] we'll be having that be we'll be
[585.8s] touching on the how to establish schools
[589.4s] what is to be taught in schools and the
[591.5s] selection of teachers you can preserve
[593.8s] that question for the next class but
[595.9s] today I'm going to give generally the
[598.7s] questions of all the studies that I've
[600.9s] been having in this class. If you had a
[603.1s] question, kindly prepare your question
[605.1s] because I'm going to eat time. But as
[607.0s] for now, I want to begin giving the
[608.9s] characteristics of true and the true
[612.1s] education and the characteristics of
[614.3s] worldly system education. Then I give a
[616.7s] few
[620.5s] a very brief then I look at two examples
[624.7s] only two examples. I look at Christ
[627.4s] today and look at the Greek history very
[630.6s] brief. then I'll be able to finish my
[632.5s] presentation. I'll be very brief. Now
[634.1s] write characteristics of true and false
[636.7s] system of education. Then we begin with
[638.3s] false system education. The book of
[640.1s] James 3:3 is what are beginning to read
[643.4s] is there is where we are going to pick
[645.2s] our characteristics and see them very
[647.9s] fast. Somebody is there to help me read.
[650.8s] Brother God pray you can just come and
[652.5s] sit here use a microphone to help me
[654.7s] read these things very fast. And you
[657.0s] will also help me project the quotations
[659.0s] because those who are sitting there is
[661.0s] like they have gone for a short break
[663.2s] and they are coming back. So you can
[665.0s] fill that position. James 3 and the 13
[669.3s] the Bible
[670.8s] says
[673.2s] hallelujah 3:1 and you also take your
[677.0s] book and write the following. The Bible
[678.6s] says
[680.0s] James says James 3:3 The Bible says if
[684.5s] you have But if you have bitter envy
[688.5s] and strive in your heart not do not
[693.2s] glory not lie not against and lie not
[696.7s] against the truth. This wisdom the
[699.2s] wisdom that comprises of envy and strife
[703.4s] descended not from above. It descended
[705.9s] not from above. And it is earthly it is
[709.0s] earthly sensual sensual and devilish and
[712.1s] devilish and we saw that that the first
[714.2s] method of the district system of
[715.8s] education is to make
[718.0s] people complete so
[721.4s] right of systemation number one it it
[725.6s] comprises of beta envy it comprises of
[729.1s] beta envy somebody's looking at the wall
[732.6s] thinking that they're being projected
[734.4s] I'm not going to project them let me
[736.3s] Just read them for you in this laptop
[737.8s] and write them. It comprises of beta
[740.4s] environ. Number two, it promotes strife
[743.9s] in the heart. It promotes strife in the
[748.0s] heart. Number three, it does not descend
[750.7s] from
[754.7s] above. Number two, promote strength in
[757.8s] the heart. Promote strength in the
[760.7s] heart.
[767.1s] promote strive in the
[776.4s] heart. The next says it, it does not
[780.4s] descend from
[782.6s] above. Amen.
[786.5s] In other words, it does not descend from
[788.0s] the father. In the book of John 8:44, we
[792.0s] tell you that anything that does not
[794.4s] desend from the father comes from who?
[796.9s] Satan. Amen. Anything false is satanic.
[801.1s] Amen. So it does not descend from above.
[804.2s] It is earthly. It is
[808.3s] earthly. It is earthly. That is number
[811.7s] four. Number five, it is sensual.
[815.8s] It is
[818.4s] sensual. Number
[820.8s] five, it
[822.7s] is
[825.6s] satanic stroke.
[828.6s] Demonic stroke
[832.3s] delish. In other words, put in
[836.0s] bracket. It makes people
[840.4s] worship us.
[844.0s] It is a
[845.2s] satanic paganism, demonic, devilish.
[847.8s] Those are the same
[849.2s] things. I'm going to the characteristics
[851.4s] of education the book of James chapter
[853.4s] 3. You
[854.8s] proceed I'll
[864.3s] try read the Bible. Uh
[867.7s] 3 verse number 15. The Bible says this
[871.2s] wisdom this wisdom descendant from
[873.4s] above. It does not descend from above
[876.8s] it is sensual and deish those ones we
[881.1s] have written that is the characteristics
[882.8s] of purple system education and world
[884.5s] system education or you can still write
[887.0s] system of education but realize that we
[889.5s] have another kind of education. Now you
[892.4s] can also write characteristics of true
[895.4s] education. characteristics of truth
[898.3s] education.
[901.8s] Philippians 3 16 the Bible says it says
[906.5s] from ending and strife is there is
[910.3s] confusion and every evil one but the
[914.6s] wisdom that is from above the wisdom
[917.1s] that is from above that is first the
[919.7s] first characteristic of true education
[921.8s] it descendeth from above write that it
[925.6s] descendeth from above it is godly it is
[929.0s] godly and promotes Christianity Write
[931.8s] that statement that way. It descended
[934.2s] from above. It is godly and promotes
[941.2s] Christianity. Number two, it is
[945.0s] pure. I think the book of James chapter
[948.2s] 3 has been projected. It is pure. It is
[951.8s] pure. In other words, no unnecessary
[954.6s] knowledge. We realize that in the world
[956.6s] of education there are necessary what?
[959.3s] Knowledge. Amen. And there are things
[961.7s] that are taught that should not be
[963.0s] taught to Christians today. Today today
[966.2s] no unnecessary there's no no any
[968.9s] unnecessary knowledge. Number three, it
[971.0s] is peaceable. It is
[973.3s] peaceable. Write very fast. Write very
[975.8s] fast. Time is running. I want to write
[978.4s] very fast. It is
[980.4s] peaceable. It is
[983.6s] gentle. It is peaceable. It is
[986.3s] gentle. It is easily treated.
[991.6s] Somebody saw that easily in
[995.6s] treated full of
[998.4s] m is full of
[1001.1s] nami. It is full of good fruits.
[1017.2s] It is easily
[1019.4s] intreated. It is
[1021.5s] easily
[1024.8s] intreated. It is full of
[1029.5s] mer. Full of good
[1034.3s] fruits. Full of mer. Full of good
[1037.3s] fruits. without
[1044.8s] partiality, without hypocrisy. Realize
[1047.6s] that the worst of education is
[1050.3s] hypocrisy. It is a form of godliness.
[1053.7s] You pretend to be loving God, but unite
[1056.3s] them in
[1058.1s] works. Without hypocrisy, the fruit of
[1062.0s] righteousness is sown in its principle.
[1066.3s] The fields of righteousness is in
[1072.9s] every characteristics of truth
[1076.1s] education. Amen. Amen.
[1080.2s] Education and we say that that is the
[1082.8s] monique. I'm giving two aims of system
[1085.9s] education two only. The rest you will go
[1088.8s] and study for yourself. My first point
[1091.1s] from the Sabbath was that
[1094.0s] it it aim is to overthrow what?
[1096.8s] Protestantism. Number two, write this
[1099.5s] number two. So if you're writing your I
[1103.0s] know you write notes on the so if you
[1105.7s] want to write them just write a
[1108.4s] purposes then you write continuation
[1111.5s] then you just write number two are
[1114.5s] you
[1119.3s] think it proves the Bible to be error
[1122.9s] and a
[1123.7s] theory it proves the Bible to be
[1126.8s] error and a theory. There was a
[1129.0s] quotation by was read that was read by
[1131.4s] brother Neon I think it was ministry of
[1135.0s] it should be page 443 maybe I'm going to
[1138.0s] check the page I give but it says that
[1140.1s] philosophical speculation and scientific
[1142.7s] research philosophical speculation and
[1145.4s] scientific research in which God is not
[1149.7s] acknowledged are making skeptics of
[1152.9s] thousands in the schools of today the
[1156.0s] conclusion that learned men have reached
[1157.9s] as the result of their scientific
[1159.7s] investigation are carefully taught and
[1161.9s] fully explained while the impression is
[1164.7s] distinctly given that if these learned
[1167.6s] men are correct the Bible cannot be
[1172.1s] hallelujah hallelujah so we are told
[1175.0s] that the theories that are taught in
[1176.6s] school today evolution if they can be
[1179.0s] correct then the Bible cannot be correct
[1182.6s] so one of the aim of the purple
[1184.9s] education is that it proves the Bible to
[1188.2s] be error and a theory. So that is why
[1191.7s] today it makes people not study the
[1193.8s] Bible because they believe that is an
[1196.2s] error. It is just a theory what is
[1199.6s] believed.
[1201.2s] Amen. Next aim it promotes a
[1205.1s] self this what we tackled in our last so
[1208.9s] I'm going to deal with few examples and
[1211.8s] give questions to this class.
[1214.6s] It promotes self the root of all
[1218.4s] evil. It promotes self the root of evil.
[1221.0s] Education page 225 paragraph 4.
[1224.7s] Education
[1234.6s] 225 education page 2.5 says precious the
[1240.3s] service done and the education gained in
[1242.9s] carrying out these principles but how
[1245.2s] widely different is much of the
[1247.0s] education now given from the child's
[1249.5s] earliest years is an appeal of emulation
[1253.4s] and rivalry
[1255.1s] of emulation and what that
[1260.5s] is. So we are told
[1263.4s] that it fosters
[1266.4s] selfishness the root of all evil
[1271.6s] page
[1275.9s] paragraph 4. It is not from the
[1278.2s] beginning. It was taken just the last
[1281.1s] part where it says that precious the
[1283.3s] service done and the education gained in
[1285.6s] carrying out the princip this principles
[1287.6s] but how widely different is much of the
[1289.4s] education now given from the child's
[1291.4s] earliest
[1298.7s] years that fosters selfishness the root
[1303.2s] of all what all evil allow me repeat
[1306.7s] this quotation that was uh testing
[1310.6s] church 3 page 384 paragraph 3 I think
[1315.1s] that is the reputation says the
[1316.8s] following words
[1320.8s] 384 paragraph 3 384
[1329.1s] paragraph number three says it says it
[1332.0s] says when the lamb and the takes
[1334.2s] position of the heart and becomes a
[1337.0s] ruling passion Mhm.
[1346.6s] That is not what I want. What I want say
[1349.0s] is under the general heading of
[1351.1s] selfishness came every other scene. That
[1353.2s] is what I'm looking for today because
[1355.8s] the system of education of today
[1358.0s] strengthens what?
[1360.4s] Selfishness. Let me check if it is this
[1362.6s] one.
[1371.0s] volume 4 paragraph 3 I'm sorry not
[1375.0s] speech says that another book was opened
[1378.3s] wherein were recording the saints of
[1380.1s] those who profess the truth under the
[1382.2s] general heading of selfishness came
[1384.3s] every other sin there were also headings
[1387.0s] over every column and these opposite
[1390.3s] each names were recorded in their
[1392.1s] respective columns the lesser saints so
[1394.6s] what I wanted you to understand that in
[1397.1s] this systemation
[1401.6s] promoting
[1403.6s] came in other words the system of
[1406.6s] education the worldly system of
[1409.1s] education promotes what sin
[1413.7s] sle can someone overcome sin with that
[1417.4s] system of education no is very is
[1421.0s] impossible but the grace of god is
[1423.0s] sufficient for those we decide to make
[1425.5s] decision decision. So it is also like
[1428.6s] this. It is also idol worshiping is also
[1431.3s] idle worshiing. This takes me to the
[1433.8s] great green history very fast green very
[1437.0s] fast. And I'm reading
[1439.7s] SDP SDP. This is page
[1444.8s] uh SDP page
[1449.6s] uh let me get the
[1452.0s] page
[1454.2s] page
[1467.0s] 80. Get this. I was to look at this
[1470.7s] green
[1471.7s] history very deeply but time is not
[1474.1s] going to allow me to give that because I
[1476.4s] already see I have 40 minutes but I
[1478.5s] wanted to give a good time to questions
[1480.8s] and answer this page 181 182 paragraph
[1486.2s] one says the following I want to be
[1488.5s] projected to see that system of
[1490.6s] education is idol
[1494.0s] woriing you are not woriing god why
[1497.8s] system ofation However much we come to
[1499.4s] the church on
[1500.6s] Sabbath and we go back and we prepare
[1504.2s] meals on
[1507.7s] Friday. Hallelujah. I want to see that.
[1511.4s] I want to see that.
[1515.5s] 1821 1821 says it says there is a
[1520.0s] pathetic straight throughout their
[1521.9s] history. They sympathetic straight
[1524.3s] throughout their history and their
[1526.5s] history what Greek history are together.
[1530.3s] What is the characteristics of Greeks
[1532.2s] that you
[1533.3s] know they are speaking for what? Wisdom.
[1537.2s] Hallelujah. But is there wisdom is if
[1540.2s] Christ is preached they say that is
[1542.4s] foolishness foolishness. I mean with you
[1544.6s] in the book of 1 Corinthians 1:21 23. So
[1547.9s] the Greeks are only seeking for whistle
[1550.7s] but they all fruit Christ as for
[1553.8s] foolishness. Hallelujah. But Christians
[1556.4s] need to have Christ. Are we together? So
[1559.4s] there's a pathetic strength throughout
[1561.3s] their history. They come so close to
[1564.6s] God. They come so close to God. They
[1568.0s] come so close to they come so close to
[1571.0s] the God of whom?
[1573.0s] Uhhuh. And yet not knowing him. And yet
[1576.0s] not knowing him.
[1579.9s] They wandered in such utter darkness.
[1583.8s] Continuing there is a constant reminder
[1586.9s] of the faith of those students of today.
[1590.3s] The Greek history is a constant reminder
[1594.4s] to the students of whom?
[1599.3s] They seek to understand
[1603.7s] natural phenomenal they can explain how
[1606.4s] much kilaro was formed. Are you they
[1610.1s] know and they have theories that will
[1612.4s] explain how the world came to exist
[1614.9s] exist and they can explain how we have
[1617.2s] seven continents. Amen. And they know
[1620.6s] what happened between the seas and the
[1622.7s] land. They can explain. They want to
[1625.1s] understand natural what phenomena but do
[1629.6s] what? Continuing. But do not interpret
[1633.0s] nature. They do not interpret nature. By
[1636.6s] the words of his creator. By the words
[1638.8s] of who? His great. Is great. Hallelujah.
[1641.5s] In other words, the nature should be
[1644.0s] interpreted by the words of who? Of
[1646.2s] creator. And the words of creator is in
[1648.7s] what? The the Bible. Hallelujah. So
[1651.9s] people understanding the phenomena
[1653.6s] without the by the way you cannot
[1659.2s] stud the Bible they go
[1662.3s] to you told that heaven is a what is a
[1666.1s] school nature what listen I read that
[1669.4s] quotation when I was reading that page
[1672.8s] 547 says that heaven is a what a school
[1676.1s] so there's the students of today are
[1678.3s] desiring to understand phenomena but do
[1680.3s] not interpret nature by the word of the
[1683.4s] creator. Now listen to the next
[1684.7s] statement. Hallelujah. Someone who is
[1687.0s] tired get this next statement. It says
[1689.6s] they
[1693.0s] worship who? Zeus and
[1697.4s] Pluto Pluto
[1700.6s] instead of instead of the Christ. So if
[1703.6s] you are answering questions in you idol
[1706.5s] worship.
[1717.5s] Yes. The Bible will tell you that you
[1720.3s] cannot worship two people. No one can
[1723.0s] serve what two masters. Amen. So when
[1725.6s] you are coming to the church but in the
[1727.6s] other hand you what you need to know
[1730.1s] that you have one
[1732.4s] master. Are we together? So it is idol
[1736.4s] should be continue reading the fact that
[1738.5s] the children of today the fact that the
[1740.8s] children of today upon myths and
[1743.6s] tradition of this are fed upon myth and
[1747.4s] tradition of this very
[1751.3s] in darkness
[1753.7s] gods of Olympus and ignorant of God
[1758.2s] whose shoot the mountains against
[1761.8s] whose smile was sanding Uh-huh. And
[1765.5s] whoever the fields,
[1768.2s] the Greeks, the Greeksh
[1773.9s] were they accepted the sacrifice of the
[1776.6s] slain of the lamb of God. Greeks offered
[1778.9s] what?
[1780.6s] But we are asked that what value of
[1785.0s] their sacrifice if they rejected the
[1787.1s] lamb of God. The system of education
[1790.1s] today people sacrifice. Amen. And they
[1794.1s] give
[1805.2s] offerings that to do what
[1811.4s] to sacrifice
[1813.7s] continually saying the spirit of
[1815.9s] prophecy the spirit of prophecy was
[1818.0s] cherished was cherished but when God's
[1820.8s] prophet made the But while God's prophet
[1823.8s] mingled with the three people,
[1827.0s] the Greek prophet
[1833.9s] secluded from the peopleh.
[1843.4s] Amen. So I don't
[1846.8s] want you to know
[1852.1s] that today I'm
[1854.8s] praying to worship God. Amen. That will
[1858.6s] be my call. This week is a week of
[1860.8s] making and we are told that when a call
[1863.3s] is made and you make a step forward and
[1864.7s] God is going to give you angels to go
[1866.7s] to. Amen. So we have people in the in
[1869.3s] the Bible. We have people in the Bible
[1871.8s] of whom the word of God was studied. The
[1876.1s] last we saw in the education of Moses. I
[1879.8s] want just to reiterate this that Moses
[1882.7s] studied in who school? In the schools of
[1886.1s] Egypt. Are we together? And Moses
[1889.0s] studied very great topics. We saw that
[1891.2s] Moses was a philosopher. He was a poet.
[1893.8s] He was a mathematician. And we were told
[1895.9s] that Moses used to call what?
[1899.6s] And used to score airplanes not
[1903.8s] airplanes but when God called Moses he
[1906.4s] had to under system to get education.
[1909.2s] Hallelujah. He has to go to God's
[1913.3s] universe. Hallelujah. Amen. And we are
[1916.9s] also told not only that I want to read
[1919.7s] for last one quotation that will
[1922.0s] summarize the education and last we also
[1924.9s] saw when they were answering a question
[1926.8s] a brother asked we realized that there
[1928.6s] were also schools of prophets in which
[1931.1s] Daniel's friends to obtain their what
[1933.8s] education and the education was very
[1936.1s] high more than the education that was
[1939.5s] provided in the universities and
[1941.8s] colleges of what
[1945.1s] United
[1948.4s] you reading it
[1954.0s] again very fast then we come to
[1956.9s] something I'm just next to coming to the
[1959.4s] end of my I want to give you time to
[1961.6s] answer questions the place of Bible
[1965.7s] 8 page
[1973.0s] 80 this is a book written by also Trevor
[1977.8s] a pioneer of 7th Adventist. Now this is
[1981.5s] page
[1982.9s] 80 paragraph one project that you see
[1987.6s] this the schools of the
[1989.4s] prophets there were schools of the
[1991.8s] prophets at the same time there also
[1994.5s] schools of the palants
[1997.5s] now look at the education that was in
[1999.6s] the schools of the prophets is it there
[2005.0s] from the specification distinct remain
[2007.4s] in the scripture from the specification
[2009.4s] decision made in the scripture from the
[2012.6s] product that must be passed. It is
[2015.6s] certain that all we have of life must
[2019.7s] comprehend the requirements of the
[2021.6s] king's respect of the king respecting
[2025.6s] the youth who are to beh
[2029.7s] and this no small tribute is no small
[2033.0s] tribute
[2035.3s] to the educational ideas
[2038.3s] of
[2040.0s] king
[2041.9s] indeed his views of education
[2045.4s] in this verse as soon in this verse I'm
[2047.8s] talking Daniel chapter one chapter one
[2050.2s] from verse four in this verse of the
[2053.0s] Bible in this verse of the Bible for all
[2055.6s] practical purposes for in advance for in
[2059.2s] advance
[2061.4s] of the educational system that prevents
[2067.2s] people the kind of the people that
[2070.5s] require the education was advanced more
[2073.9s] than the education that people acquire
[2076.5s] today today today. Hallelujah. Daniel
[2079.9s] was very wise. Amen. He was very wise
[2084.4s] and he qualified to be chosen to serve
[2087.3s] at the king's what palace. Are we
[2089.2s] together? Now continue reading even
[2093.4s] in the living colleges. That prevents
[2098.0s] even the living and universities. The
[2101.6s] living is universities where United
[2104.4s] States not
[2105.6s] even
[2108.4s] amened what United States. Amen. That is
[2112.0s] the wherein that proceed in the
[2116.3s] paragraph that is paragraph three. It
[2118.2s] says, it
[2119.6s] says Daniel, where did Daniel and his
[2123.2s] three companions and his three
[2124.8s] companions
[2126.6s] obtain the education which enable them
[2128.8s] successfully which enable them
[2130.6s] successfully to pass the examination to
[2133.2s] pass the examination
[2140.1s] require that exist of the leading the
[2143.4s] leading of United where can that
[2146.3s] education be acquired?
[2149.4s] them and education which made them
[2154.0s] skillful and knowledge and understanding
[2157.9s] science and understanding what science
[2159.9s] science and which gave them ability and
[2162.7s] which they gave them ability
[2165.6s] in all the things
[2170.0s] withoutation it can be answered but but
[2173.3s] I like that place I like that place I
[2175.4s] want you to see But you see people today
[2178.1s] are talking of the education. You see
[2180.1s] these things or these things and maybe
[2181.8s] education of the world. You see this
[2183.7s] this cameras, this laptop and and we
[2187.0s] said last time that not every knowledge
[2189.4s] is from the what? We realize that Satan
[2193.4s] with and when God has given a knowledge
[2196.1s] that will help in the taking the gospel
[2199.0s] of the message people has to accept that
[2202.7s] knowledge. Are
[2204.0s] you
[2211.3s] so I will read your quotation that says
[2214.2s] that whosoever staples this conviction
[2216.5s] because it is what inclinations will
[2220.0s] soon fail to determine between truth
[2224.8s] and you are my light no
[2229.4s] without education can be answered it can
[2232.4s] be answered in the school of the
[2234.4s] prophets. In the schools of the what?
[2237.4s] The prophets.
[2241.1s] He established school in
[2244.9s] there was at that time there was at that
[2247.4s] time a school a school of schools of the
[2251.3s] prophets in Jerusalem in Jerusalem.
[2254.0s] Hallelujah. So there were schools of the
[2256.1s] prophets in
[2257.6s] Jerusalem. Amen. And you remember during
[2260.1s] the time when the sons of the prophets
[2262.1s] were going to cut what? Trees. Where
[2265.0s] were they? In the school of the
[2267.8s] prophets. Amen. And they were going to
[2269.8s] build what classics. Amen. They were
[2272.5s] going to build classes. Where the
[2276.0s] hallelujah. So green fields, green
[2278.3s] history will change you. There is
[2280.8s] something. Have you ever known why
[2283.3s] there's a a gap between
[2287.4s] and have you ever known why a
[2292.8s] gap that is
[2299.1s] between Greek history that Greek history
[2303.9s] answers that then I'm looking just
[2305.4s] example of Christ I'm giving you time
[2306.9s] for
[2307.8s] questions 19 get this Get this why there
[2311.8s] is an ass time between Malachi and the
[2314.9s] book of Matthew SDP the page is 190
[2319.2s] paragraph this will tell you about the
[2322.6s] issue that has happened what God had
[2325.4s] given to his people and what is
[2327.5s] happening in this last days it says 192
[2334.3s] this one is wasting now time let me use
[2336.7s] this
[2338.7s] for it has
[2341.8s] that the inoc
[2347.0s] the time between the prophecy of Malachi
[2349.7s] between the prophecy of Malachi and John
[2352.9s] the Baptist and John the Baptist when is
[2355.6s] John the history of John the Baptist
[2357.0s] beginning in the book of Mark Matthew
[2359.8s] Are you yes
[2362.8s] continue reading we are now ready we are
[2366.2s] now ready to appreciate the reason to
[2368.8s] appreciate The reason Israel why Israel
[2373.4s] so long was so long without the sound
[2377.1s] without the sound of the prophet's voice
[2379.8s] of the prophet's voice God
[2383.6s] God is a communication system of what
[2387.9s] education hallelujah how many are seeing
[2390.3s] the history of the Greece how it
[2391.6s] appeared in God's word look at this God
[2394.2s] gave Israel a sense of what education
[2397.7s] separate and distinct from the system of
[2402.3s] all other nations. Nations. Hallelujah.
[2405.6s] So could Israel go to other system of
[2408.5s] other nations? No.
[2419.1s] of
[2422.0s] today. Amen. And we will be putting that
[2425.5s] verse that is
[2427.0s] first that we are the people what
[2431.2s] nations. Uhhuh. Chosen. Chosen what? Is
[2435.5s] a chosen what? So if the chosen
[2437.7s] generation seventh day adventist today,
[2439.9s] God is a separate and distinct the
[2443.9s] system of all other nation. A system
[2448.0s] continue a system which ifever
[2452.9s] would forever make it impossible make it
[2455.7s] impossible for the people for the people
[2458.7s] to go into.
[2463.6s] So they were following
[2471.4s] it says it says
[2474.4s] but Israel but Israel
[2479.5s] gave up a god-given system for teaching
[2483.9s] for the teaching nation of the hidden
[2486.6s] what nations. Next it says look at that
[2489.9s] very painful that however much God gave
[2492.2s] them a system that was different from
[2494.8s] all other nations but they gave up to
[2497.1s] the teachings of other what nations are
[2499.9s] together they went to another system of
[2502.0s] what education they copied other nations
[2505.3s] and allow me tell you how many have ever
[2507.7s] read the book of numbers chapter
[2509.8s] 25 chapter 25 what is happening in
[2512.1s] numbers chapter 25
[2514.2s] numbers numbers chapter 25 it was even
[2516.7s] presented Yeah. Ecumenical movement.
[2518.8s] Ecumenical what? Movement. Do you know
[2521.2s] the tribe in Israel that led that?
[2525.0s] The tribe in that was the tribe of
[2529.5s] Robert. What to
[2533.4s] birth? What is the birth of education?
[2536.5s] The science of what? Education. So we
[2538.9s] are going to join movement after doing
[2541.7s] what? Selling our birthight. You go to
[2544.7s] cross and shadow page 288. That one we
[2548.0s] read paragraph 3. Go to paragraph 4.
[2550.5s] Read the next you realize that the tribe
[2552.6s] of the women were the people who went
[2555.1s] and choose and stay next to Moabites.
[2559.6s] Are you together? And by that
[2563.0s] they selling their what? Their so people
[2566.8s] are going to sell your true science
[2569.5s] of others.
[2574.3s] Okay. If we go to the system of other
[2578.2s] other gods and other gods
[2583.7s] today, tell me a school today where one
[2587.3s] god is taught the schools of the world.
[2598.8s] We are going to go to captivity and
[2600.6s] number 25 is going to repeat itself
[2603.2s] itself. It continuc
[2629.2s] religion. Hallelujah. No one can go to
[2631.8s] that education and come up with a
[2634.1s] pure
[2638.0s] mind. You know that are also using that
[2640.8s] verse. I always read you that it is only
[2642.8s] that time is limited. The first
[2645.4s] principles of
[2647.4s] the child. If you turn up a child from 1
[2650.6s] to 12 years you will
[2653.2s] forever. That is what are saying that is
[2656.1s] written in fundamental of education
[2657.9s] where books reading go and get that book
[2659.9s] to read. You see today elders are coming
[2662.2s] some elders some are coming and say
[2664.6s] train up a child. So if you are doing
[2666.2s] with them they will not do
[2670.1s] what this
[2672.4s] is worshiping of God but when they went
[2676.4s] to they came up
[2680.3s] with religion. But let me ask you those
[2683.7s] who obtained their education in the
[2685.8s] schools of the prophets like Daniel were
[2688.6s] they simulated with that system of
[2690.0s] education? No. Were they impressed by
[2692.8s] that religion? No. When you teach Daniel
[2695.8s] chapter 3, they refused to bow down what
[2699.4s] to the idol. Are you so going to
[2703.2s] under
[2704.8s] go the beast and let the change and the
[2708.2s] grace of God be sufficient to the unto
[2710.3s] them. Hallelujah. Somebody is sleeping
[2713.1s] in this class. Just wake up a man. The
[2716.6s] grace of God is sufficient to those who
[2718.3s] sleeping. Hallelujah. So it continues by
[2720.4s] saying I won't finish.
[2722.6s] It continues by saying uh Jews return
[2725.8s] from Babylon. Jews return from Babylon.
[2730.0s] Babylonian ideas of education and
[2732.9s] religion. This prepared
[2736.9s] them with readiness. The teaching of the
[2740.2s] the teachings of the Greeks.
[2743.3s] A question. What have we read that the
[2745.5s] teaching of the Greek is leading to? I
[2748.1s] do
[2749.4s] not. I I when somebody is trying to
[2753.4s] understand phenomena of the earth
[2755.3s] without the
[2763.7s] Bible in
[2766.0s] that age. So they were able to accept
[2769.8s] the teachings of the Greek. The Greeks
[2791.7s] continually from
[2794.4s] Malachi of John the Baptist.
[2797.8s] family
[2807.2s] go and read others for yourself. Amen.
[2809.7s] Amen. By the
[2811.6s] way, what made
[2815.5s] you follow the
[2817.8s] system? But you
[2819.9s] know, God has arrived to do what worship
[2824.7s] him. So there were those who remained
[2827.3s] and remain steadfast to the system. I'm
[2830.2s] looking up Christ as an example. Then
[2832.0s] I'm giving time for prayers. Christ as
[2834.1s] an example. The book of that is first
[2836.6s] Peter 2 verse 21. The Bible says the
[2839.9s] following
[2843.0s] words 2 verse 21 says the Bible reads
[2847.4s] the
[2849.9s] reads uh 2
[2854.0s] 2 Uh-huh. Because Uh-huh. Because Christ
[2857.8s] also suffered for us. Because Christ
[2859.7s] also suffered for us. Living as an
[2861.8s] example. Living as an example. That you
[2864.9s] should follow. That you should follow
[2867.1s] what? Yes. That Christ left an example
[2869.6s] that you should follow what?
[2876.8s] First John 2 verse 6.
[2882.0s] It says, It says John 2 verse 6. Uh-huh.
[2887.0s] Uh-huh. He that he abideth in him. He
[2889.9s] that he abideth in
[2892.0s] himself to walk
[2895.1s] even walk as he walk. Hallelujah. How
[2899.0s] many love that
[2900.4s] verse? How many love that verse? And
[2903.3s] when you can preach that verse, you will
[2905.5s] talk of Christ humility. Hallelujah. You
[2909.2s] talk of Christ kindness. Amen.
[2912.8s] Will you mention that in that verse?
[2915.8s] Hallelujah. Amen. Will you mention
[2917.8s] those? But people always mention the
[2923.8s] Christ. Do we always mention the Christ?
[2927.4s] But what the Bible says is that we read
[2930.6s] again. It says it says he that abided
[2935.5s] him abided in him. God himself to walk
[2938.9s] him even as he walked.
[2940.5s] All you want to say so
[2944.4s] Christ, you talk of Christ, you talk of
[2948.4s] Christ, you talk of
[2950.6s] Christy, you talk of
[2958.8s] Christ verse
[2966.2s] 28, the Bible say the mans
[2970.4s] And when they saw him, And when they saw
[2972.6s] him, they were amazed. They were amazed.
[2974.7s] And his mother said unto him, And his
[2976.5s] mother said unto him, Son, why
[2980.6s] this the Bible? It says, son, why hast
[2984.4s] thou dealt with us? Behold, thy father
[2987.7s] and household this. Uhhuh. I'm checking
[2991.0s] the verse where it says that and the
[2992.5s] child grew 40. The Bible says the child
[2996.2s] and the child grew what strong in spirit
[2998.6s] and what strong in spirit that is Jesus
[3001.5s] Christ filled with wisdom. Filled with
[3003.8s] what? Wisdom. Filled with what? Wisdom.
[3006.3s] Wisdom. And the grace of God was upon
[3008.7s] you. And the grace of God was upon him.
[3011.8s] Christ was also filled with what?
[3013.5s] Wisdom. He now Christ was is our
[3017.1s] example. And if you're buying in Christ,
[3019.0s] we need to follow the step of Christ.
[3021.5s] Look at this. I'm reading this
[3024.3s] pages page 9 page 7 69 paragraph 3 then
[3028.9s] I paragraph one then I pray listen to
[3032.0s] the following
[3036.6s] words in the in the name of
[3042.9s] Christ for religious instruction for
[3045.7s] that that did not provide for religious
[3048.3s] instruction of the young regard
[3051.2s] was regarded
[3052.8s] under of God. Next
[3058.0s] statement had become for
[3062.0s] tradition in a great degree supplanted
[3065.6s] supplanted what? The script. That is the
