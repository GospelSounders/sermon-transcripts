When tempted, instead of giving utterance to our feelings, instead of giving utterance for our feelings, let us by faith a song of thanksgiving, lift up a song of thanksgiving to God. Just continue. Paragraph 2 says, "Yeah, paragraph 2 says, "We praise thee, oh God, the son of the son of thy lamb to Jesus who died and is now gone above. We embrace thee. We embrace thee, oh God. Thy spirit of light usually continue by saying our shown as our savior and scattered our scattered our [Music] night to the lamb that was slain. into the lamb that was slain, who was born, who has bought our sins, has cleansed every s and has cleansed every stain, and praise to God of all and praise to God of all grace us who has brought us and us and us and guided our ways, guided our ways. Amen. Amen. So s we need to pray. We're in the valley of temptation. Amen. Amen. We need to spend our time in singing songs. [Music] How did Christ overcame? Was Christ temped? Yes. How did he overcome during the time of temptation? And then it says in SD sons and daughters of God page 8 number six it says in how did Christ overcome how did Christ overcome that how did Christ over when others are impatient when others are impatientful complaining because when people are complaining even in the church Today when people are complaining, people are in because what? Because self is not. So what is the problem the church is? What we need to do? begin to sing some of the songs of God. So when people are impatient when people are complaining too much when there is confusion and disunion in the church instead of also joining in muring hey he hey hey what do you need to do you need to do what how many are practical you know we need I taught I taught theory from from one entire How many practical they are saying that this can be applied that when we are tempted when they are confused in the church we are saying that [Music] continue reading it continue by saying when Christ was working at the bench others sometimes others were sometimes trying to cause trying to cause him to be impatient. He will begin singing some of the beautiful songs before realizing. Amen. Amen. Right. This is how you use the square me upside down. Then Christ will not complain. Amen. Amen. He will just begin doing what? Singing. Singing some beautiful what? Singing some beautiful words. And those people forget they join in what? In singing. That is how we are going to overcome in the last days. Amen. Amen. We are in our duties. When people are complaining, people are impatient, people want just to ignite you to sin. What you need to do is to begin singing. Just think we praise thee for the light of thy then those people will just join you. By the way, there is there is the power of music in influencing. How many have ever read that music is a power in influencing the mind to the right channel when rightly what used rightly used? That is how Christ that is how Christ overcome. Go to the book of evangelism very fast. Evangelism 510 and number three it says it say it says God is glorified. God is glorified by songs and praise from pure heart. By songs and praise from a pure heart filled with love and devotion to him. So God is glorified by songs or praise from what? Pure heart. From a pure heart. So to me before we be singers we need to have a pure what? Pure heart. That is the prayer. I think it is proverbs 23 says that guide all your heart with all diligence for out of the heart is the is we can read that verse. So for us to give songs that are going to praise God songs that are going to draw the enemy away their hearts need to be pure. Amen. Amen. Keep thy heart in all. Keep thy heart in all of the issues of out of the art and the issues of what? Of so going to keep our heart when tempted. If you are going to offer songs of praise, we are going to have victory over sin and our songs will go for praises glorifying God. They are going to draw the enemy. What? Are we? Amen. Amen. Question. Can those who do not study the Bible sing? Those who do not study the scriptures, can they be singers? I just want to you and please I want to conclude. You are you don't study the Bible. How many do study their Bibles by the daily? One, two, three. What about all of the remaining? How many do sing daily? This church people are becoming toughed. Are you becoming sing? How many do you sing daily? How many of songs today can those who do not study the Bible be allowed to sing? No. Why? Huh? In church or where? Singing is for the church. In church. Yeah. Can we sing in the church not study the Bible? [Music] Do we have songs today that are not biblical? Yes. Like the Louis know that there's a song say are they biblical? So we want to read evangelism 58. It says note that someone did not study the Bible cannot be amen. It says those who those whose hearts are in the effort are in the effort in their efforts to reach the people in their efforts to reach the people. The Lord's messengers are not to follow the ways of the world. The Lord messengers are not to follow the ways of the world. In the meeting in the meeting that are that in the meeting that we are of the world, they are not to depend on. We are not to depend on worry singers theoretical and theoretical display to awaken the interest. How can those who have the word of God that how can those who have no interest in the word of God to understand is truth be expected be expected to receive to sing with the spirit and understanding. So those who the Bible cannot sing in the spirit and that is why today we have songs the father and the son and the holy word they sing without the spirit and understand the main root cause is that they don't study the what so we cannot have singers in the church who do not study the bible so if you want to sing the bible must be the foundation of your songs. Amen. Amen. That is why we read select spirit of prophecy single students are going to sing songs that are going to give God's glory. We are going to see that if you trace music in the sanctuary, you will come to understand that the sons of the were given the duty of watch and they were still they were trusted by the only what they chose them trained them. They were studying the Bible even in the time of Nemiah 88. We tell that they were dedicated studying the pages to 509.1 that the same 509.1 only sweet simple sing only sweet simple singing sweet simple singing how how can God be glorified how God be glorified when you singing when you depend for your singing. So the problem today is that the choirs we have sing for what? Can we hire choirs to come and sing for us? We pay them. I had a brother T saying that you know in our next competing we are going to call those who are from Tanzania. We're going to How many are that? They're going to call them. Can we hire them? Come and sing for us. Brother Koski, can we hire those who are singing beautiful? By the way, those in Tanzania are singing beautiful what songs? Can we hire them to come and sing for us? Not hire, but call. You can call but not hire. We can call but not hire. Do they sing for money? So my question is that can we hire them? They come they sing for us for two weeks. We give them something give them send offh we we f them when they are coming then we give them send off. We that is we have hired them to come and sing for us. We need you can express for us please. Yes. Because also evangelist evangelist are not being hired but they are being it means that we are also working for man. Okay. So what is the meaning of hiring? I've hired a tendant at the end of the the occation I pay the send off. The agreement on hiring ts. Uhhuh. How much do you hire these tents for? for two weeks 100 shillings per day will give you for 1400 shillings. Mhm. Yeah. But if you say can you help me with your yes I can help you with but when you say have this 1,000 as a thank you I don't understand. So what is the meaning of hiring? Working on a money basis. An agreement. An agreement. Okay. Read, read, read. It says that glorified. How can God be glorified? When you depend for your command, my right. When you see these things in a right light, you will have in your meeting. You will have in your meeting only singing the congregation the whole congregation to join in the song to join in the song. What if among those who are now present here their voices are not music musical. at the voice of others. When the singing is that such that angels can unite with the singer singing from than singing that sanctified lips cannot. So we are not even to depend on worldly. Jump to the next page. I want us to help me understand this question. Yes. Now read paragraph three. The answer is there. 549.3. Write that. It says it says it says musical help offer. Accepted musical help offer in the meetings. Listen to this. In the meetings in the meeting, in the meeting singing should not be neglected. The singing should not be neglected. Neglected. God can be glorified. God can be glorified. Part of the service by this part of the service. And when singers offer their services, when singers offer their services, they should be accepted. They should be accepted. Amen. So singing should not be neglected. Amen. We need even to make a program where we have seasonal singing. Amen. We just have They just okay just read it say that it says but money not that but money shall not be used to higher sins but money shall not be used to higher sins but money should not be used to higher so you cannot you cannot sit and agree with the people that come sing for us for 2 weeks. They give you the amount. In 2 weeks we are going to give us 50. We need not to use our money to what? That is what is happening in the churches we left. What about here? Just read it says the thinging of simple in the congregation by the congregation has a not possessed has a ch that is not possessed by the singing of the singing. However it may be so much not used. However the singers are skilled, however, they Amen. Amen. However skillful they may. Amen. Money should not be used. Why? What? Yes. I think that is understood. 510.5 jump 510. It says then you go to five. I want to conclude because time was much spent. It says I want to write down that qualities of good music. As I conclude, I want to make a call. It says it says qualities of good music qualities of good music great improvement can be made in singing can be made in singing. Something that the louder they sing. Notice this. Some think that the louder they sing Some think that the louder they sing. Some think that the louder they sing, the more they make, the more music they make. Three. But noise is what? But noise is not noises. The people saying make I had people singing today. Are you singing or making noise? I had people sing. Why you singing all noise? singing. Why? Why are people so silent? You know, when you're teaching a child, a church is silent. Why you people singing or making noise? Singing. Singing. You are singing. But something that the louder they sing, they won't sing. Noise is not what? Noise is not. But today all singers want to make noise. Just listen to all composition of songs. today is they want to y the song just begin then it is in climax. There are times when I was listening to worldly music some years back. But but now today so I don't know 510 I want to conclude I want to make a call by the way 510 paragraph 5 listen to this carefully it says it says it says in some now in some of our churches I have even solos that were going to be unable for the service of the Lord's house they were unsuitable for the service of the Lord's house the long drawn out not the long brought out not And the peular sound. The pecular sound common in common in operetic singing singing are not pleasing to the angels are not pleasing to the ears of the angels. Delight to hear of praise. They delight to hear the simple songs of praise s in a natural s in a natural tone. The songs in which everyone is uttered. The song is The song in which every word is uttered. Every word is uttered. Every word is uttered clearly. Every word is uttered clearly in a tone in a musical tone. And join us in singing. And the song in which the angels join us in singing. Read. They refrain. They take up the refrain. That is from the heart. That is from the heart with the spirit and the what? Yeah. So even followers do me make mistake. They want just to draw long note. It says this is what I want to read. It says is it do read on 3004? He said it says now the Lord has taught us many things. How many so from the past lesson that the Lord has revealed things to us that we need to correct. How many how many are convicted that the Lord has revealed to us things we need to correct.

[909.4s] in the valley of temptation. Amen. Amen.
[911.8s] We need to spend our time in
[914.4s] singing songs.
[916.7s] [Music]
[922.4s] How did Christ
[924.1s] overcame? Was Christ temped? Yes. How
[927.9s] did he
[928.8s] overcome during the time of temptation?
[932.6s] And then it says in SD sons and
[935.0s] daughters of God page
[937.2s] 8 number six it says in how did Christ
[941.8s] overcome how did Christ overcome
[946.8s] that how did Christ over
[951.4s] when others are impatient when others
[954.0s] are
[956.0s] impatientful complaining
[958.4s] because when people are complaining even
[961.0s] in the church Today when people are
[964.0s] complaining, people are in because what?
[968.6s] Because self is not. So what is the
[971.6s] problem the church
[976.0s] is? What we need to do?
[982.2s] begin to sing some of the songs of God.
[985.9s] So when people are
[987.6s] impatient when people are complaining
[990.2s] too much when there is confusion and
[993.5s] disunion in the
[995.4s] church instead of also joining in muring
[998.7s] hey he hey hey what do you need to do
[1002.5s] you need to do what how many are
[1004.8s] practical you know we need I taught I
[1007.5s] taught theory from from
[1009.5s] one entire
[1012.3s] How many practical they are saying that
[1015.3s] this can be applied that when we are
[1017.1s] tempted when they are confused in the
[1019.0s] church we are saying that
[1023.3s] [Music]
[1026.4s] continue reading
[1028.8s] it continue by
[1033.4s] saying when Christ was working at the
[1036.4s] bench others sometimes others were
[1040.0s] sometimes trying to
[1043.3s] cause trying to cause him to be
[1045.8s] impatient.
[1050.1s] He will begin singing some of the
[1052.3s] beautiful
[1055.0s] songs before realizing.
[1065.4s] Amen. Amen.
[1074.8s] Right. This is how you use the square me
[1078.6s] upside down.
[1081.0s] Then Christ will not complain. Amen.
[1083.0s] Amen. He will just begin doing what?
[1085.4s] Singing. Singing some beautiful what?
[1089.0s] Singing some beautiful words. And those
[1091.6s] people forget they join in what? In
[1094.4s] singing.
[1097.5s] That is how we are going to overcome in
[1099.1s] the last days. Amen. Amen. We are in our
[1101.8s] duties. When people are complaining,
[1103.6s] people are impatient, people want just
[1106.3s] to ignite you to sin. What you need to
[1109.1s] do is to begin singing. Just think we
[1112.3s] praise thee for the light of
[1115.6s] thy then those people will just join
[1118.1s] you. By the way, there is there is the
[1120.2s] power of music in influencing. How many
[1122.5s] have ever read that music is a power in
[1125.4s] influencing the mind to the right
[1127.2s] channel when rightly what used rightly
[1131.6s] used? That is how Christ that is how
[1135.2s] Christ overcome. Go to the book of
[1137.4s] evangelism very
[1139.5s] fast. Evangelism 510 and number three it
[1144.1s] says it say it says God is glorified.
[1147.4s] God is glorified by songs and praise
[1150.3s] from pure heart. By songs and praise
[1153.2s] from a pure heart filled with love and
[1155.8s] devotion to him. So God is glorified by
[1158.8s] songs or praise from what? Pure heart.
[1162.5s] From a pure heart. So to me before we be
[1165.9s] singers we need to have a pure what?
[1168.2s] Pure heart. That is the prayer. I think
[1171.7s] it is proverbs
[1174.0s] 23 says that guide all your heart with
[1177.6s] all diligence for out of the heart is
[1179.5s] the
[1180.8s] is we can read that
[1183.9s] verse. So for us to give songs that are
[1186.6s] going to praise God songs that are going
[1188.6s] to draw the enemy
[1190.0s] away their hearts need to be pure. Amen.
[1193.4s] Amen.
[1197.3s] Keep thy heart in all. Keep thy heart in
[1201.8s] all of the issues of out of the art and
[1206.2s] the issues of what? Of so going to keep
[1209.1s] our heart when tempted. If you are going
[1212.4s] to offer songs of praise, we are going
[1215.6s] to have victory over sin and our songs
[1218.8s] will go for praises glorifying God. They
[1222.3s] are going to draw the enemy. What? Are
[1225.0s] we? Amen. Amen. Question.
[1228.2s] Can those who do not study the Bible
[1231.0s] sing? Those who do not study the
[1233.1s] scriptures, can they be
[1234.9s] singers? I just want to you and please I
[1238.0s] want to conclude. You are you don't
[1239.4s] study the Bible. How many do study their
[1242.0s] Bibles by the
[1244.7s] daily? One, two,
[1248.4s] three. What about all of the remaining?
[1254.0s] How many do sing
[1260.7s] daily? This church people are becoming
[1265.2s] toughed. Are you becoming sing? How many
[1269.2s] do you sing daily?
[1273.2s] How many of songs
[1277.5s] today can those who do not study the
[1279.8s] Bible be allowed to sing?
[1284.2s] No.
[1285.3s] Why? Huh?
[1288.6s] In church or where?
[1291.8s] Singing is for the church. In church.
[1294.2s] Yeah. Can we sing in the church not
[1297.1s] study the Bible?
[1299.5s] [Music]
[1310.0s] Do we have songs today that are not
[1311.8s] biblical? Yes.
[1315.6s] Like the Louis know that there's a song
[1325.5s] say are they biblical?
[1332.4s] So we want to read evangelism
[1335.8s] 58. It says note that someone did not
[1339.7s] study the
[1340.8s] Bible cannot be
[1343.9s] amen. It
[1345.6s] says those who those whose hearts are in
[1350.0s] the effort are in the effort in their
[1352.5s] efforts to reach the people in their
[1354.4s] efforts to reach the people. The Lord's
[1356.4s] messengers are not to follow the ways of
[1358.6s] the world. The Lord messengers are not
[1360.9s] to follow the ways of the world. In the
[1363.5s] meeting in the meeting that
[1366.4s] are that in the meeting that we are of
[1370.8s] the world,
[1373.2s] they are not to depend on. We are not to
[1376.7s] depend on worry
[1379.1s] singers theoretical and theoretical
[1384.6s] display to awaken the interest. How can
[1388.3s] those who have the word of God that how
[1392.1s] can those who have no interest in the
[1394.3s] word of
[1401.0s] God to understand is truth be expected
[1405.0s] be expected to receive to sing with the
[1408.6s] spirit and understanding. So those who
[1411.7s] the Bible cannot sing in the spirit
[1415.5s] and that is why today we have
[1418.4s] songs the father and the son and the
[1420.6s] holy
[1422.5s] word they sing without the spirit and
[1425.7s] understand the main root cause is that
[1428.2s] they don't study the what so we cannot
[1431.1s] have singers in the church who do not
[1433.1s] study the
[1435.0s] bible so if you want to sing the bible
[1438.0s] must be the foundation of your songs.
[1440.0s] Amen. Amen. That is why we read
[1443.4s] select spirit of
[1446.6s] prophecy
[1454.5s] single
[1456.7s] students are going to sing songs that
[1459.2s] are going to give God's glory. We are
[1462.2s] going to see that if you trace music in
[1464.2s] the sanctuary, you will come to
[1466.5s] understand that the sons of the were
[1468.7s] given the duty of watch and they were
[1471.6s] still they were trusted by the only
[1475.1s] what they chose them trained them. They
[1478.5s] were studying the Bible even in the time
[1481.3s] of Nemiah 88. We tell that they were
[1484.1s] dedicated studying
[1486.2s] the
[1490.1s] pages to
[1493.7s] 509.1 that the
[1499.7s] same
[1501.5s] 509.1 only sweet simple sing only sweet
[1505.6s] simple singing sweet simple
[1508.6s] singing how how can God be glorified how
[1512.7s] God be glorified when
[1515.1s] you singing when you depend for your
[1517.9s] singing.
[1521.4s] So the problem today is that the choirs
[1523.8s] we have sing for what?
[1527.5s] Can we hire choirs to come and sing for
[1529.6s] us? We pay them. I had a brother T
[1532.8s] saying that you know in our next
[1535.6s] competing we are going to call those who
[1537.9s] are from Tanzania. We're going to How
[1540.2s] many are that? They're going to call
[1542.8s] them. Can we hire them? Come and sing
[1545.1s] for
[1546.0s] us. Brother Koski, can we hire those who
[1549.8s] are singing beautiful? By the way, those
[1551.5s] in Tanzania are singing beautiful what
[1557.4s] songs? Can we hire them to come and sing
[1560.0s] for us?
[1564.0s] Not hire, but call. You can call but not
[1567.2s] hire. We can call but not
[1570.1s] hire. Do they sing for
[1572.9s] money? So my question is that can we
[1575.4s] hire them? They come they sing for us
[1578.0s] for two weeks. We give them something
[1581.1s] give
[1581.9s] them send offh
[1586.8s] we we f them when they are coming then
[1589.4s] we give them send off. We that is we
[1591.8s] have hired them to come and sing for us.
[1594.8s] We need
[1598.6s] you can express for us please.
[1601.6s] Yes. Because also evangelist evangelist
[1605.0s] are not being hired but they are being
[1607.7s] it means that we are also working for
[1609.3s] man. Okay. So what is the meaning of
[1612.4s] hiring? I've hired a tendant at the end
[1615.0s] of the the occation I pay the send off.
[1619.3s] The agreement on hiring ts. Uhhuh. How
[1622.2s] much do you hire these tents for? for
[1624.6s] two weeks 100 shillings per day will
[1627.5s] give you for 1400 shillings. Mhm. Yeah.
[1631.4s] But if you say can you help me with your
[1633.9s] yes I can help you with but when you say
[1637.0s] have this 1,000 as a thank you I don't
[1640.7s] understand. So what is the meaning of
[1642.2s] hiring?
[1644.2s] Working on a money basis. An agreement.
[1647.3s] An agreement. Okay. Read, read, read. It
[1651.7s] says that glorified. How can God be
[1654.9s] glorified?
[1658.2s] When you depend for
[1663.2s] your command,
[1667.1s] my right. When you see these things in a
[1670.2s] right light, you will have in your
[1672.0s] meeting.
[1673.8s] You will have in your meeting
[1676.4s] only singing the congregation the whole
[1680.8s] congregation to join in the song to join
[1683.4s] in the song.
[1687.0s] What if among those who are now present
[1689.2s] here
[1693.4s] their voices are not music
[1697.0s] musical.
[1699.0s] at the voice of others.
[1705.1s] When the singing is that such that
[1706.6s] angels can unite with the
[1711.1s] singer singing from
[1714.8s] than singing that sanctified lips
[1717.3s] cannot. So we are not even to depend on
[1720.0s] worldly. Jump to the next page. I want
[1723.0s] us to help me understand this question.
[1729.1s] Yes. Now read paragraph three.
[1733.0s] The answer is there.
[1735.2s] 549.3. Write that. It says it says it
[1739.7s] says musical help offer. Accepted
[1743.8s] musical help offer in the meetings.
[1747.1s] Listen to this. In the meetings in the
[1749.9s] meeting, in the meeting singing should
[1753.5s] not be neglected. The singing should not
[1755.9s] be neglected. Neglected. God can be
[1759.0s] glorified. God can be glorified.
[1761.8s] Part of the service by this part of the
[1764.0s] service. And when singers offer their
[1766.3s] services, when singers offer their
[1768.5s] services, they should be accepted. They
[1771.0s] should be accepted. Amen. So singing
[1773.5s] should not be neglected. Amen. We need
[1776.6s] even to make a program where we have
[1779.6s] seasonal singing. Amen. We just have
[1785.1s] They just
[1794.1s] okay just read it say that it says but
[1797.9s] money not that but money shall not be
[1801.0s] used to higher sins but money shall not
[1804.2s] be used to higher sins but money should
[1807.5s] not be used to higher so you cannot you
[1811.1s] cannot sit and agree with the people
[1813.0s] that come sing for us for 2 weeks. They
[1815.9s] give you the amount. In 2 weeks we are
[1818.9s] going to give us 50. We need not to use
[1822.2s] our money to what? That is what is
[1825.1s] happening in the churches we left. What
[1827.8s] about here?
[1832.6s] Just read it says
[1836.9s] the thinging of simple in the
[1838.9s] congregation by the congregation has a
[1842.1s] not possessed has a ch that is not
[1844.2s] possessed by the singing of the singing.
[1850.3s] However it may be so much not used.
[1855.0s] However the singers are skilled,
[1858.8s] however, they Amen. Amen. However
[1862.0s] skillful they may. Amen. Money should
[1864.3s] not be used. Why? What? Yes.
[1867.7s] I think that is
[1873.6s] understood. 510.5 jump 510.
[1878.3s] It says then you go to five. I want to
[1881.4s] conclude because time was much spent. It
[1884.4s] says I want to write down that qualities
[1887.1s] of good
[1888.2s] music. As I
[1890.7s] conclude, I want to make a call. It says
[1893.8s] it says qualities of good music
[1897.0s] qualities of good music
[1899.8s] great improvement can be made in singing
[1902.5s] can be made in singing. Something that
[1904.8s] the louder they sing. Notice this. Some
[1907.6s] think that the louder they sing Some
[1909.6s] think that the louder they sing. Some
[1912.0s] think that the louder they sing, the
[1914.4s] more they make, the more music they
[1917.2s] make. Three. But noise is what? But
[1920.8s] noise is not
[1922.7s] noises. The people saying
[1926.1s] make I had people singing today. Are you
[1929.8s] singing or making noise? I had people
[1933.2s] sing. Why you singing all noise?
[1936.9s] singing.
[1939.7s] Why? Why are people so silent? You know,
[1943.1s] when you're teaching a child, a church
[1944.9s] is
[1946.0s] silent. Why you people singing or making
[1948.4s] noise?
[1950.7s] Singing.
[1952.2s] Singing. You are singing. But something
[1954.8s] that the louder they sing, they won't
[1958.0s] sing. Noise is not what? Noise is not.
[1961.2s] But today all singers want to make
[1962.9s] noise. Just listen to all composition of
[1965.5s] songs. today is they want to y the song
[1971.0s] just begin then it is in
[1973.4s] climax. There are times when I was
[1975.9s] listening to worldly music some years
[1993.4s] back. But but now
[1999.4s] today so
[2004.2s] I don't know 510 I want to conclude I
[2007.4s] want to make a call by the
[2009.5s] way 510 paragraph 5 listen to this
[2012.5s] carefully it says it says it says in
[2015.4s] some now in some of our
[2019.1s] churches I have even solos that were
[2022.2s] going to be unable for the service of
[2024.4s] the Lord's house they were unsuitable
[2026.3s] for the service of the Lord's house the
[2028.4s] long drawn out not the long brought out
[2031.4s] not And the peular sound. The pecular
[2034.8s] sound common in
[2037.8s] common
[2039.0s] in operetic singing singing are not
[2042.8s] pleasing to the angels are not pleasing
[2044.9s] to the ears of the angels.
[2048.0s] Delight to hear of praise. They delight
[2051.3s] to hear the simple songs of praise s in
[2054.2s] a natural s in a natural tone. The songs
[2057.7s] in which everyone is uttered. The song
[2060.9s] is The song in which every word is
[2064.2s] uttered. Every word is uttered. Every
[2066.6s] word is uttered clearly. Every word is
[2069.1s] uttered clearly in a tone in a musical
[2073.2s] tone. And join
[2078.5s] us in singing. And the song in which the
[2081.3s] angels join us in singing. Read.
[2084.0s] They refrain. They take up the refrain.
[2087.3s] That is from the heart. That is from the
[2091.5s] heart with the spirit and the what?
[2094.9s] Yeah. So even followers do me make
[2097.5s] mistake. They want just to draw long
[2102.3s] note. It says this is what I want to
[2105.6s] read. It says is it do read on 3004? He
[2110.2s] said it says
[2112.7s] now the Lord has taught us many things.
[2114.5s] How many so from the past lesson that
[2116.3s] the Lord has revealed things to us that
[2119.2s] we need to correct. How many how many
[2121.8s] are convicted that the Lord has revealed
[2123.7s] to us things we need to correct. Listen
[2126.4s] to this. It says, it says, it says, the
[2129.2s] Lord has revealed to me, the Lord has
[2131.3s] revealed to me that when the heart is
[2133.4s] cleansed, that when the heart is
[2135.2s] cleansed, I will sanctify sanctified the
[2138.3s] members of the church are partakers of
[2140.2s] the divine nature. The members of the
[2142.0s] church are partakers of the divine
[2143.6s] nature, our power will go forth. Our
[2145.9s] power will go forth from the church.
[2148.1s] from the church
[2150.2s] who believe the truth that cause men in
[2153.4s] the heart that will cause melody in the
[2155.7s] art. Men and Men and women will not
[2159.5s] depend upon their instrumental.
[2162.2s] Note that men and women will not depend
[2164.2s] upon instrumental what? Full of drums,
[2167.4s] full of jest. We saw full of jokes, full
[2170.6s] of laughter and what and good and good
[2173.4s] thing and cheers. Men and women will not
[2175.8s] depend on such a music. Men and women
[2178.8s] men and women will not depend upon their
[2181.8s] instrumental music. will not then depend
[2183.8s] upon their instrumental music on the
[2186.6s] power and the mercy but on what? On the
[2189.6s] power and the grace of what? Amen. Read
[2195.4s] which will give fullness of joy. So joy
[2198.2s] is not found in noise in just in
[2201.1s] joke. Joy is found in the power and the
[2204.2s] grace of who? God. What the power of
[2206.5s] God? Christ. The grace of God. Christ.
[2210.0s] Christ. Read. It says it says
[2213.6s] there is a work to be done in the
[2216.2s] rubbish in clearing away the rubbish.
[2220.9s] Note that there is a work to be done in
[2223.7s] clearing away the what?
[2226.1s] How many have such rubbishies in their
[2228.5s] phones? You have songs that are they are
