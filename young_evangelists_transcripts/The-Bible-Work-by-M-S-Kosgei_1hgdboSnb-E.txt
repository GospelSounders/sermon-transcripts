FULL TRANSCRIPT:
This is not working. So if it's not working, I may take the advantage. All right. Happy Friday. Yeah, as I said, it's not my preference. Okay, thank you. I'll try my best to use it for the interest of those who are outside and I hope all things will go well. Um my time always runs very fast. So for the interest of that allow me just to pray and we begin. Let's pray. Gracious loving father in heaven, we thank you and we praise you. Thank you for your love for the whole week to this day. We are now approaching the Sabbath and Lord, you've been so wonderful to each one of us. We are getting into another study and we ask for your blessings. Lead us through. We pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ, your son. Amen. For those who are joining this program for the first time, my name is cos gay stiffen misoy. I just want to invite you to this program. It's called self support work. And the intention of this program is to bring a balance between ministry and how to sustain ourselves while we go for ministry. That is the intention. That means God is leading us in this moments of reformation to avoid both extremes. The first extreme which all of us are accustomed to and the society is so much into it is the love of the world. That means we throw ourselves into the field of life to acquire wealth as much as we can forgetting that we need to live a divine life and to do the work of God in heralding the gospel to those who are to be saved. The second extreme is an idea of a monastic lifestyle, monish kind of life which makes people to just want to do the preaching and preaching and preaching only nothing else. So the Lord wants us to have a balance between preaching and self-sustainance for the ministry. I have levered in the previous sessions to establish that the Lord has given us very many gifts both spiritual and natural and acquired. Amen. We saw that all these talents both acquired and those that the Lord has given us are intended to serve other people. The Bible says the spirit give us the gifts severally to every man according to our ability that it may profit that we may profit with all. Right? Amen. Now you will remember that you keep answering as I ask you questions because it keeps telling me we are together. So in this third um sequel we are going to talk about the Bible and work. What does the Bible say about work or labor in another way? But just before I get into that I do not have very many slides but let me just begin with this text in the Bible in the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 8 vers 2. For those who have met me before, you know it's one of my favorite texts that I love reading before any study. The Bible says in 1 Corinthians chapter 8 and 2, "And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know." Amen. If any man refers to all of us, there is no one who is left out of that text. It doesn't matter whe you are a senior minister and you've been in the field for 30 years or 50 or you came to the field yesterday or this morning you gave your life to Jesus. The Bible says if any man of course definitely the word man here does not refer to those people who dress like me. It refers to all of us as humanity. Amen. I think u you understand when the old Bible says man it refers to humanity the old English rather and we are told if any man thinks that he knoweth anything he knows how much nothing so if you think you knew anything you must settle that with yourself that how much do you know the Bible says nothing as you ought to do what to know that should be the attitude with which we come to every study as brethren because the Lord will want to lead us deeper and deeper. But as soon as you say in yourself, I know that you block the way that the Lord should not lead you further and further. Amen. Now let me bring you now into this clearly. Um what does the Bible say about work? Now we know that the book of Genesis chapter 1 and chapter 2 are explanations of what the Lord did. Amen. So we will say that God is the first worker or can you find any other worker except God as the first one. The Bible says in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Amen. Was that work when the Lord created? What's the other word we can use for created? Made. The Lord made made. What's the other word? Formed. The Lord formed. So you understand that the process of creating or forming is work. Amen. Uh now I didn't want to define this but does anyone remember the definition of the word work in science? What was work? I used to say the product of what and what? What was that? Yes. Oh no no no. Okay. Because we do not remember. Let's not trouble ourselves. But there is something like that. Yes. So, okay. Right. I hope all things will go well. [Music] Um, so the Lord was working for how many days? How long did it take for the Lord to create the heavens and the earth? Six days. Amen. That very first week we will say Genesis chapter one is a wonderful story of how God spend the very first week which forms the blueprint for all the time that will exist afterward. Amen. Now you know that before Genesis 1, time had never existed. Do you know that? Maybe you didn't get that. There was no time before Genesis 1 verse one. Before the Bible says in the beginning, that's the beginning of time. From then the time began to be reckoned. But before then, we call it what? Eternity. Amen. So from that beginning going into that side we call it eternity. No counting of years. And when we shall have spent a thousand years in heaven and we come to this earth again and we begin a very long long long life into eternity. There will be no accounting of time. You've heard that song which says there is no counting of time over there. There was no counting of time. But as soon as time began to be counted, the very first part of that time the Lord spent a week to work. And when the Lord had worked for six days, he rested on the seventh. Amen. And it made a complete one week of seven days. And from that time to this date, there has just been cycles of that very very week. Amen. You know this song with the morning has broken like the first. Now each morning that we see is like the very very first morning. Each Sabbath that we see is like the very very first Sabbath. Every Sunday that we see is like the very very first Sunday. So the Lord spent a week to demonstrate to us what we will be doing from that time unto eternity. Amen. Yeah. Sure. So that's it. So I am saying the Lord has painted a clear picture for humanity for what we should be engaged in for the rest of the days. How many days should we walk? Six days. Genesis 2 8 the Bible says and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had found. Amen. Again apart from creating the Lord does what is called planting. Now you realize that planting doesn't sound so much of creation right or how many of you by planting in the gardens they are creating but we know the lord has put in principles and by his powerful word he still makes those plants to grow and that creation and regeneration is progressed. Amen. That's it. So the Lord also was the first gardener or the first farmer. And so I have said often times those who are going to get engaged in farming walk their work is the closest in similarity with what God did. Amen. Yeah. So Genesis 2:15 says, "And the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." Amen. I am asking you a question in this verse 2 15. Had sin occurred in the world? No. But the Lord made man to do what? After he placed him in the garden, he said to him to do what? To dress it and to do what? And to keep it. Now you know there were no weeds to make man so disturbed. No, he wasn't worried about very many things. There was no watering. But the Lord wanted him to keep it because the Lord was a creator and he had made man in his own image. Man was supposed to reflect God even in the caring and making things to look more beautiful than they were. Amen. Right? So but after sin something else happened. That's Genesis 3:19. The Bible says to Adam. Now you know the story how it happened. how they fell into sin and how the Lord came in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid and the Lord said who told you that you are naked you know the story now Genesis 3:19 says two man to the man after the Lord had given the punishment he began with who yes he began with who there were three parties to be punished began with now there was the woman there was the serpent And then there was the man. The Lord began with who? Did he begin really with the man? You go and find that. But now, let me read it. 3:1 19. It says to Adam, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground, for out of it was thou taken, for dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return." So the Lord says to the man, you shall eat by sweat. I ask you this question. Before sin was man eating by sweat. No, that means the work that man was doing was not the labor which over taxes or which taxes our strength. It was rejuvenating. The work was like recreation. You know when you are having recreation, you're relaxing and listening to music. Do you sweat? Do you feel tired? Relax. That's what God intended. The work shall be for mana. 3:23 says, "Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken." So previously the Lord had said to do what? to keep to dress and to to keep it. Amen. But in the last portion he says to do what? To till the ground from whence he was taken. So we are very sure that before sin man was not tealing the ground. He was keeping it and dressing it. Yeah. But after sin, he was supposed to till it and from then uh he will get his food through hard labor and the Lord designed it that way for the interest of lessening the effect of sin. Yeah. The Sabbath is a testimony of work. The Bible says in Exodus 20:8, remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Sixth day shalt thou labor and do all thy work. But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt not do any work, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man's servant, nor thy maid servant, nor thy kettle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day. Wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it. Amen. Now you we've read this text over and over laying emphasis on the importance of remembering the Sabbath and keeping it holy. Amen. Now today we are reading this text to lay emphasis on walking on six days. Now the Bible says how many days shall you work? Six days. Now I want to imagine that you are not going to work for six days. Do you have any reason why you should rest on the Sabbath? So anyone who has not been working for the six days does not have any warrant to rest on the on the Sabbath because otherwise he has been resting. But the Bible doesn't say six days shall thou rest. Does the Bible say that? So but human beings we love resting more than doing what? than working except children. Children are the only prime example of what the Lord designed. I'm talking about young children. Those who have not known what relaxing means. They do not love to sleep. They will only sleep as they are overcome by sleep, not by their own design. But we who have grown up, we know that living a leisure kind of a life is the ideal for us. Our education system has taught us that way that we need to be resting and you just need to work hard a little bit enjoy a vast life of idleness. The Bible doesn't teach that. The Bible teaches that work for how many days or six days. And in the Bible there is nothing like a vacation where you have a vacation to rest. No, it's about working for how many days? He who breaks the Sabbath on the seventh day is guilty of breaking the law of the Lord. And he who is idol on six six days is also guilty of breaking the very very law. Said that's that's too much on our side. But we need to think about that. Let's read further thoughts from the Bible concerning work. Proverbs 13:1 says, "Wealth goten by vanity shall be diminished, but he that gatherth by labor shall increase." Amen. Wealth gotten by vanity, vanity. You know, there are many ways that the world is teaching us that you can acquire money or wealth. And one example is gambling. You place 100 shillings and you earn how much? A million. And many people want to do that, right? Because we love wealth gotten by vanity. The Bible says if you get wealth by vanity, what happens? It shall diminish. What does it mean to diminish? Now people who have studed business the one which is gotten by labor does what? It increases. Amen. Do you see that there is the blessing of the Lord in labor and not in idleness? The Lord recognizes only one moment in a week where you need to rest and that is the Sabbath. You work for six days and then you rest on Sabbath and that's what the Lord wants and you will have your wealth increase. You rest on the six days and your wealth will diminish. That's it. I didn't say that. It's the Bible. Proverbs 21:25 the Bible says the desire of the slothful killth him for his ants refuse to labor. The desire of the slothful. Now we said the other day a slothful person is a lazy [Music] person. So they keeping because you do not have. So when you pass, you say, "Wow, what a nice vehicle. I wish I had that man. It will kill you. If your hands will accept to work, you will have it." Amen. I'll get that quote someday um before we finish this. It's on councils on stewardship that the Lord has placed in the heart of man the desire to accumulate wealth and it's godly. I'm not talking about those who love the world. Talking about people like Abraham who will not make their wealth the object of their life. We talking about such people. That desire is divine to bring wealth together. And wealth means what? It means what you have, right? If it's clothes, if it is food, is that wealth? Yeah. 21 26 it says he coveted greedily all the day long but the righteous giveth and spareth not. Amen. So the slothful person covert greedily now greedily means what? Soed greedy all the day long. So what's the work of a slothful person? a lazy person just sit down and imagine things and keeps imagining like one time you know these were the thoughts I used to have when I used to go to school you know because I was very ambitious and I knew one time I'll have a very beautiful big house very nice car living in a very nice estate with very beautiful children and beautiful wife attending in a beautiful church those were always the ideas you get the point that's covetousness And that's laziness because it is the truth that there is nothing good that comes on a silver platter. Amen. Yeah. That's a statement which must can pass to be scriptures. That's how it is. That's what the Bible says here. If you are a lazy person, you keep desiring. You keep coveting. And the Bible doesn't want you to coveret. But if you are laboring, you minimize the moments of covetousness. Proverbs 14:23 says, "In all labor there is what? Profit." In all labor there is what? Profit. But the talk of the lips tended to what? Pen. So the Bible calls us to labor and if you labor there is profit. Amen. No one should entertain the idea of idleness whatsoever. There are friends here and you are hearing messages on true education and you do not love going to school because you do not love reading and you don't love the school program and then you think because you heard this message now it's high good time I got an opportunity to quit. You get the point? So the reason for you to choose true education is because you found it an easy way to avoid work, right? The Lord judgeth the hearts. You see it so deep into your heart. And if you want to make a decision based on this friend, you are just an infidel. I will say to you personally and advise you go back to school and study. Did you get the point? If you are making that decision out of an avoidance of work, go back. You are not sincere in your heart. You are living a lie. Abraham was not leaving his place because he was avoiding work. You get the point. I hope that one no one will follow me late and say you are denying the truth. I am telling you a message that the Lord wants us to have in this time because God wants us to be sincere in our hearts. Not because we found it easy to follow this direction is why we left the other direction if that is the reason the lord will judge the heart I don't say further on that so we are told the words of the lip they tend to penary into poverty and poverty enough I'll still talk about idleness uh when we'll talk about self-sport proper that it is required of every steward to be faithful in the place where he is. Amen. So if the Lord shall call you to be a mother, you be faithful in your duties as a mother without idleness or laziness. 2 Thessalonians 3:10 the Bible says, "For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any will not work, neither shall he do what should he should he eat. For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, walking not at all, but are busy bodies. Now them that are such we command and exalt by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they walk and eat their own bread. Amen. The Lord is calling us and because this meeting is meant for the youth primarily our generation is cast. We are living at a gener generation of idleness where people will not want to work. People want to live. I'm not talking about the church only. The rest of the world people just want to live a careless easy lifestyle. Is that a true or false? We try to avoid work as much as possible. Paul says when they were at Thessalonica, what did they do? They commanded them that those who do not work should not do what? Should not eat. And he says, "For we hear that there are some among you who are busy bodies." You know what busy bodies are? You is about people who meddle with other people's businesses. Someone is busy doing their stuff, you are there busy speaking about very many many things. The Bible is saying to us that this life of busy boding and especially speaks categorically on women. When you go to Timothy now he says this is the best counel for us if you are found in such a category he says we command and exalt you by the lord do what in quietness go and walk and eat your own bread. Amen. The church should not encourage laziness at all costs. If someone is blessed with strength, let them walk and eat their own bread. Amen. You know, we will still talk about these things in depth for sure. But that's the word of the Bible. Amen. He said this time always passes quickly, but today I'll catch up with it. Let's uh we have a very wonderful reading here on CT 277. We begin with paragraph 1. I'll do some few readings and then I'll just end. The things of earth are more closely connected with heaven and are more directly under the supervision of Christ than many realize. The things of the earth, we are told are connected with the things of where heaven. Now you know Christ is that ladder which connects heaven and earth. And we are told that Christ is directly supervising these things than we can ever realize. He says all right inventions and improvements have their source in him who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working. Amen. All right. Inventions and improvements. the person who invented this light and it's the right one. The Bible says it does it so well. The other day just to remind you perhaps we we can forget we were created by the Lord. Amen. Unless you guys believe in evolution. If you believe in evolution then you are exempted from thinking in this manner. You can think the other way around. But this is the thought. If you are created by the Lord, you received your life from who? From the Lord. And every ability and every gift that you have comes from who? From the Lord. Sometimes we say it's natural as though it invented itself across the way. Evolution is the only way one which says uh species keep acquiring uh advantages over other species. But the Lord equipped us with strength uh and efficiency and intellect and all these gifts which we can use. So if you can invent something the ability the intelligence you are using came from who? From the lord. We said every good gift comes from where? From above from the lord of lights. So we are told that every invention and every improvement have the associ him who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in workings the skillful touch of the physician's hand. So the doctor when he treats with that skillful hand we are told his power and nerve and muscle is knowledge of the delicate mechanism of the body is the wisdom of divine power. Amen. So if you have a thorough knowledge on anatomy and physiology and how all these things work, it comes from where? From the Lord to be used in behalf of the suffering. So the Lord has equipped you to profit with all. Amen. The skill with which the carpenter uses his tools, the strength with which the blacksmith makes the anvil ring come from God. Amen. You know, I'm reading these things and uh my heart really melts because when this message began, we didn't see these things so clearly as they appear right now. Amen. The Lord is opening the path of light. Doesn't the Bible says the path of a righteous man shineth further and farther unto the perfect day? Amen. That's it. So the Lord is saying if you are a carpenter the skill that you have comes from who? From the Lord. If you are a blacksmith. That strength comes from who? From the Lord. Whatever we do, wherever we are placed, he desires to control our minds that we may do perfect work. Amen. So wherever the Lord will place you, whatever you will do, the Lord desires to control our minds. Amen. Paragraph 2277 says, "Christianity and business rightly understood are not two separate things. They are harmony." You are not with me friends. Inana Christianity and business rightly understood are not two separate things. They are many. So Christianity and business are many. They are one. If you rightly understand them. If you think they are two, it's because we have not understood them. You get the point. Bible religion is to be brought into all that we do and say. Human and divine agencies are to combine in temporal as well as spiritual achievements. So while we cooperate with God on spiritual matters which we do when we pray, when we preach, when we study, when we do all these things, we cooperate with God. And so we must cooperate with him also on the temporal when we go and farm and we are digging and we are planting seed and we are pushing the nails into the wood. The Lord wants us to cooperate with him. They are to be united in all human pursuits in mechanical and in agricultural labors in meantile and scientific enterprises. Amen. Higher than the highest human thought is God's ideal for his children. That's a very famous quote on education. The Lord is not bringing us a true education which is totally inferior to the world. The Lord wants us that on mechanics and on science and on merchandise that mercantile means merchandise, right? Business. The Lord wants us to be the best of the best. I believe this personally that the Lord is not calling us to a true education which is inferior to that one which the devil has given to the world. What's the biggest problem with false education? It blends the truth with what? With error so that you cannot differentiate what is true and what is false. And that's where a true education comes and makes a correction. It is of a truth that in false education there are still elements of truth. Is that the truth or false? Yeah, there are still elements of truth. And that is why we can still even find things which were useful and they can still be used in the service of who? Because the devil managed to mingle what? Truth and what? And error. And for sure while we also drunk the error, we also got some element of what? of truth. So we are not like totally saying it is totally unfit. There are aspects of it which were in reality good. Is that the truth? But why should we go and partake the whole thing when the Lord is providing an option for that which is better without leaving that which was good over the other side. Over the other side. Amen. We have taken too long to implement true education in its practical aspect and that's why when we read such statements they do not appear in their true light but the Lord is calling out a people who will make a straight stamina not only in word of speaking about false education but in real practice of what it means to practice true education and it shall be proven I am pastor persed that before this arts history is closed, the Lord will allow us to make a clear demonstration of that practical true education which he brought to his people. It's been my prayer and I hope one time we shall show it so that people will not ask where shall we go from here. The Lord will say that's the place but we need to move so hastily so that when we shall say about mechanics and agriculture and science and business it will be practically in aspect that truly the lord has given us that field let's read further 21 paragraph 3 says there is a remedy for indolence what's indolence laziness and we have said this generation is characterized by laziness. We want to pick things which are easier to do than those ones which are hard to do. There is a remedy we are told and that is to throw off sluggishness as sin. Sluggish. Slugish. Like you want to do something but you are what? You are sluggish. This is the antidote for indolence. Throw off all sluggishness as sin that leads to pition. Just know that if I am sluggish, I will be destroyed because pition means to perish and go to work. So you throw sluggishness and you go to do what? To work. Using with determination and vigor the physical ability that God has given. So if the Lord has given you physical ability, use that to your determination. The only cure for a useless, inefficient life is determined, persevering effort. So if you've been idle, the only way to remedy that is to have a determined persevering effort. Life is not given us to be spent in idleness or self-pleasing. You might not be idol, but you might be choosing things which are pleasing to you. Right? The Lord doesn't want us to do that. Before us are placed great possibilities in the capital of strength. A precious talent has been entrusted to men for labor. So the Lord has committed you has entrusted you a precious talent. This is of more value than any bank deposit and should be more highly priced for through the possibilities that it affords for enabling men to lead a useful happy life it may be made to yield interest. says the strength that the Lord has given you is more valuable than the money you have deposited in the bank. You've heard this. I I I saw it somewhere. Someone was asking if you are asked to choose between brain now because it was said brain but let me just say knowledge and money. Which one will you choose? And definitely we will choose money, right? What about strength and money? What will we choose? Money. Because the dominance of our generation has taught us that money is the main thing. It's not friends. We need to think again. The Lord wants us to be useful in our lives. It's not just about money. Even the ecclesiast writer said the rest is not always to the fastest nor battle to the strong. Then he says time and chance for everyone. Sometimes we are engaging in business and we are not very successful for sure because the rest is not to the past. So that does not mean because we are not succeeding we should always think about money only because on all these things the Lord wants to make our character. You see the main thing to be gained is heaven. While on the long run we can sustain ourselves on the businesses that we earn. The main aim is to gain heaven. So that strength is of more value. You can lead a more useful life, balanced life than when you have money. No man has a right to sacrifice this talent to the corroding influence of inaction. All are as accountable for the capital of physical strength as for their capital of means. Now we said the other day there are several talents. We mentioned money. You remember that? We mentioned strength too. You remember that? So if the Lord commits to you strength and not money, he will require from you the use of strength. Now if you are idol, how many of us for sure have been blessed with strength, but we live a very idol, useless life. How many? Very many of us with a thought that I am still in school. You see, I'm studying. I'm going to work later. The Lord wants us to use this strength. Our schools of today have become so perverted that we think the brain is the main thing and not the brain actually it is the paper it is the certificate because if it was the brain there will be very many people even sneaking into universities to acquire an education so that they can use it in practical lifestyle without a certificate. But are there such cases where people sneak into the university because it will be useless if you don't have a paper? No one will recognize you. You get the point. So that the importance of the education of today is only found where? In the paper. Not in the person himself. But education should be found in your brother. If it is separate from you, it's useless. That's why he says hold on after education. Hold on it. Don't let it go. That's what the Bible says. But if it's packaged in a paper, that's as useless as any other paper. Because without the paper, you cannot prove that you are educated. You will need a certificate to come before the Lord to say, I'm going to bring my degree. The Lord does not need that. The Lord needs to equip us with education itself. And that education should be in us to be able to solve all practical life problems. That's it. I'm going forward. I just want to I think I still have maybe two 10 minutes. I have maybe two or three slides and I'm done. Judicious labor is healthful tonic for the human race. Judicious means temporate. you are not overwork because you were say we said we should avoid both extremes where the endeavor becomes just working for money. So we should judicious labor is a helpful tonic for the human race. Amen. It makes the feeble strong, the poor rich, the wretched happy. Amen. Satan lies in ambush, ready to destroy those whose leisure gives him opportunity to approach them under some attractive disguise. He is never more successful than when he comes to men in their idol hours. Satan lies in ambush and he is waiting to get you when you are not aware and he says he is always very successful when we are idle but when we are busy even the statement goes an idol mind is the devil's workshop and I think Luther said on the fundamentals of education he says the devil will find a work for idol hands so if you are hands are idol the devil will find a work for for you. The essential lesson of contented industry is in the necessary duties of life is yet to be learned by many of Christ followers. Let's redo that statement again. The essential lesson of contented industry in the necessary duties of life is yet to be learned by many of Christ followers. That statement places the learning in future knowing already that we have not learned this essential knowledge of contented industry. You've heard very many parents say that and they keep saying because we really think that our blessings from the Lord depend on university papers. Many people think that way, right? That without that paper, the Lord is not going to do what? To bless you. Go out and work. Be a useful person. Don't love idleness. But many people want to study to minimize their work in future. Not work. Are people going to study to work? The problem is if you work hard right now, you will be relaxing in future. Right? And many people are working hard in class to earn idleness in future. We are yet to learn as a people this essential lesson. It requires more grace, more than discipline of character to work for God in the capacity of mechanic, merchant, lawyer or farmer carrying the precepts of Christianity into the ordinary business of life than to labor as an acknowledged missionary in the open field. You got the statement. Was that right? Most of us desire to be missionaries, acknowledged missionaries in the open field. See, that's what we desire. But we are told which one requires more discipline of character. Is it working as a missionary in the open field? You know, when I'm a missionary and I'm walking around, everyone knows cuz gay is a missionary. Hey, hello pastor. Hello missionary. Hello to mission. I try to order my life because I keep meeting people that I speak about the gospel every now and then. That's my chief work, you see. So I rise up, I put on my suit, I put on my tie, I take my Bible, I walk visiting people and saying hello, Jesus loves you. Jesus loves you. What about a mechanic who has to deal with very many types of people and he must be an honest man and must witness for Christ still. The Bible is calling us to this persuasion that we should understand that wherever the place the Lord will place you, he requires you to work for him as a missionary. Amen. It is true that others will be called to be missionaries in the field that will be their chief work like Peter and John who said friends should we stop preaching the word and come and serve the tables why don't you look for people who can serve what the tables and when they went to look for people who can serve the the the tables sorry anyway for sure in our place those words look the same D and T and B and V and P they are the same. So whichever comes in my mouth just know what I'm trying to say. So say should we look for those who are going to serve the tables but those who are going to serve the tables the qualifications was that they must also be spirit filled. Amen. And so if you're going to work as a mechanic the lord requires that you also must be a spiritfilled person to work for him. Amen. It requires a strong spiritual nerve to bring religion into the workshop and the business office sanctifying the details of everyday life and ordering every transaction according to the standard of God's word. But this is what the Lord requires. Amen. And we said people are given many talents. The Lord will require of you. The Lord will require from you. There will be no excuse. So if you are a preacher and the Lord has given you also the gift of business, do business as you do what? As you preach. Because the Lord, if you will do business and you stop preaching, the Lord will require from you the talent of preaching. And if you will preach and you leave business out, the Lord will require from you the talent of what? Of business. Did you get the point? But others will be given one. Say for example, a brother has been given the talent of preaching. And it's only one talent. All of us expect him to be preaching. Amen. That's the only thing that the Lord will require from him. You understand that the Lord will require from us the highest of what we have heard. We must come to this conviction and personally I'm persuaded if we must preach the loud cry then all the talents must be brought into the work. Every part of our lives must be touched because God will send business people to that direction to that direction because how will I preach to the Muslims? Will I set up a crusade? Will they listen? But by my dealings, let me tell you one time when I completed my form four and I was doing a business and God gave me a privilege um to meet with a Muslim for sure. I'll go to him. I was buying stuff. I was doing food business. So I will be buying stuff. He was a wholesaler. So I'll go and buy. So we became good friends. So I'll come and say hey hello my I don't even remember his name. Uh but he was a good brother. Now one time he gave me a book. He said to me, I have a book for you here. I see that your heart is a very good. I will give you this book. It was a Muslim book. Now I had been praying that God will give me an opportunity to speak to this brother about the gospel. I thank that he already observed early that I was a good man. You get the point. You know that's preaching already and he will give me this book. While I was still standing in the very very shop, I was holding the book. The time is over. All right, I'll end it. I'm finishing the story and I end it. I was still standing on the counter and another pastor uh he was coming from a Sunday church and the pastor just came in. They were also friends. And then when he saw me with a book, he said, "Oh, what's that book?" He took it and when he just began holding it, the brother, the Muslim brother just came and took the book by force and he said this book I gave it to him. It should not just be held by any other person. I understood at that moment how much honor he gave to their book. It was not a Quran. It was just an adapted book giving some statements from the Quran. uh but in that contact if you are going to do business if we spend actually he left so we didn't have very much time together afterwards we God will have brought me into contact to the point that I could minister to him because definitely once he has observed that I am a good person definitely he will also want to know deeper if I said anything to him he will easily accept he actually taught me how to make rice Yeah. And actually I tried and it worked very well. So I agree that in business we can really reach people and if the Lord has given me that I really preach from the pullpit for sure. I go for public campaigns too. I also do little medical missionary and I do media ministry. That's what I do personally. I also do a lot of other work on because God really endored me in very many other things. And I appreciate that the Lord is calling for all these talents to finish the work. Don't hide the talent thinking that you must only work in a single place because the Lord will require the rest of the talents from you. I believe this is the balance that God is calling us to. The ministry will not suffer if we brought the talents will it? I mean the work of the Lord will not work will not go forward because our talents to work for the Lord. Yeah. Let's pray. Precious loving God in heaven, we thank you and we praise you. You are speaking to our dear hearts that we should give unto God what belongs to God and unto Caesar, what belongs to Caesar. We have very many talents which we've hidden for a long time and some are very practical and sometimes because of thinking they are very secular. We have robbed you of these talents. But Lord, you are calling us as a people in these moments of the loud cry to bring every gift to your service. Now we have very young people here with very uh huge strengths. We pray Lord may they be willing to surrender these strengths to you that you may use them to further their cause. Lord we pray give us comfort and encouragement. There are many things Lord that we have sacrificed for the interest of the gospel and Lord your promise is in this life we shall get 100fold and even in the life to come. Help to suffer loss to you we will say if it were not for the gospel we will be better. But Lord, help us to know that we will say if it were not for the gospel, we will be worse. I pray for our church. Help us to awaken to this realization, to say these opportunities, and to further your cause and to finish the work. Thank you for hearing our prayers. We pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ, your son. Amen. Amen. Thank you. God bless you.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[3.8s] This is not
[5.3s] working.
[6.9s] So if it's not working, I may take the
[11.7s] advantage. All
[13.6s] right. Happy
[16.5s] Friday. Yeah, as I
[18.8s] said, it's not my
[22.8s] preference. Okay, thank you. I'll try my
[25.9s] best to use it for the interest of those
[29.0s] who are outside and I hope all things
[31.8s] will go well. Um my time always runs
[35.9s] very fast. So for the interest of that
[38.9s] allow me just to pray and we begin.
[41.0s] Let's
[47.2s] pray. Gracious loving father in heaven,
[50.2s] we thank you and we praise you. Thank
[53.0s] you for your love for the whole week to
[55.4s] this day. We are now approaching the
[57.7s] Sabbath and Lord, you've been so
[59.8s] wonderful to each one of us. We are
[62.3s] getting into another study and we ask
[64.3s] for your blessings. Lead us through. We
[66.6s] pray in the precious name of Jesus
[68.2s] Christ, your son. Amen.
[74.9s] For those who are joining this program
[77.0s] for the first time, my name is cos gay
[80.8s] stiffen
[83.2s] misoy. I just want to invite you to this
[86.3s] program. It's called self support work.
[91.3s] And the intention of this program is to
[94.5s] bring a balance
[96.4s] between
[98.4s] ministry and how to sustain ourselves
[102.5s] while we go for ministry. That is the
[105.8s] intention. That means God is leading us
[109.3s] in this moments of reformation to avoid
[113.1s] both extremes.
[115.2s] The first extreme which all of us are
[117.4s] accustomed to and the society is so much
[120.2s] into it is the love of the world. That
[123.6s] means we throw ourselves into the field
[127.0s] of life to acquire wealth as much as we
[130.6s] can forgetting that we need to live a
[134.1s] divine life and to do the work of God in
[137.7s] heralding the gospel to those who are to
[140.7s] be saved. The second
[144.0s] extreme is an idea of a monastic
[147.4s] lifestyle, monish kind of life which
[151.5s] makes people to just want to do the
[154.6s] preaching and preaching and preaching
[157.0s] only nothing else. So the Lord wants us
[160.8s] to have a balance between
[163.8s] preaching and self-sustainance for the
[168.8s] ministry. I have levered in the
[171.9s] previous sessions to establish that the
[174.7s] Lord has given us very many gifts both
[178.2s] spiritual and natural and acquired.
[182.1s] Amen. We saw that all these talents both
[185.9s] acquired and those that the Lord has
[188.2s] given us are
[190.4s] intended to serve other people. The
[193.9s] Bible says the spirit give us the gifts
[198.2s] severally to every man according to our
[200.2s] ability that it may profit that we may
[202.6s] profit with all. Right?
[205.8s] Amen. Now you will remember that you
[208.6s] keep answering as I ask you questions
[212.0s] because it keeps telling me we are
[214.5s] together.
[215.8s] So in this third um sequel we are going
[220.0s] to talk about the Bible and work. What
[223.7s] does the Bible say about
[227.1s] work or labor in another way? But just
[231.0s] before I get into that I do not have
[233.6s] very many
[234.9s] slides but let me just begin with this
[238.0s] text in the Bible in the book of 1
[240.2s] Corinthians chapter 8 vers 2. For those
[244.2s] who have met me before, you know it's
[246.3s] one of my favorite texts that I love
[249.2s] reading before any study. The Bible says
[253.0s] in 1 Corinthians chapter 8 and 2, "And
[256.8s] if any man think that he knoweth
[259.1s] anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he
[263.1s] ought to know."
[265.5s] Amen. If any man refers to all of us,
[268.8s] there is no one who is left out of that
[271.1s] text. It doesn't matter whe you are a
[273.8s] senior minister and you've been in the
[275.7s] field for 30 years or 50 or you came to
[280.1s] the field yesterday or this morning you
[283.2s] gave your life to Jesus. The Bible says
[286.2s] if any man of course definitely the word
[288.9s] man here does not refer to those people
[292.1s] who dress like me. It refers to all of
[295.6s] us as humanity. Amen. I think u you
[299.8s] understand when the old Bible says man
[303.0s] it refers to humanity the old English
[305.6s] rather and we are told if any man thinks
[309.5s] that he knoweth anything he knows how
[311.9s] much nothing so if you think you knew
[314.7s] anything you must settle that with
[316.8s] yourself that how much do you know the
[318.9s] Bible says nothing as you ought to do
[322.1s] what to know that should be the attitude
[325.8s] with which we come to every study as
[328.8s] brethren because the Lord will want to
[331.4s] lead us deeper and deeper. But as soon
[334.3s] as you say in yourself, I know that you
[339.2s] block the way that the Lord should not
[341.2s] lead you further and further. Amen. Now
[345.8s] let me bring you now into this clearly.
[349.4s] Um what does the Bible say about work?
[354.1s] Now we know that the book of Genesis
[356.7s] chapter 1 and chapter 2 are
[360.8s] explanations of what the Lord did.
[364.6s] Amen. So we will say that God is the
[368.6s] first worker or can you find any other
[373.2s] worker except God as the first one. The
[376.9s] Bible says in the beginning God created
[380.1s] the heaven and the earth. Amen. Was that
[385.2s] work when the Lord
[387.8s] created? What's the other word we can
[389.9s] use for
[391.9s] created? Made. The Lord made made.
[395.9s] What's the other
[397.6s] word? Formed. The Lord formed. So you
[401.7s] understand that the process of creating
[404.0s] or
[405.3s] forming is work. Amen.
[409.8s] Uh now I didn't want to define this but
[413.5s] does anyone remember the definition of
[415.5s] the word work in
[417.1s] science? What was
[419.6s] work? I used to say the product of what
[422.0s] and what? What was
[425.0s] that?
[427.6s] Yes. Oh no no no. Okay. Because we do
[430.7s] not remember. Let's not trouble
[432.1s] ourselves. But there is something like
[433.8s] that. Yes.
[438.9s] So, okay. Right. I hope all things will
[442.8s] go well.
[444.4s] [Music]
[450.4s] Um, so the
[453.4s] Lord was working for how many
[457.8s] days? How long did it take for the Lord
[460.2s] to create the heavens and the
[461.9s] earth? Six days.
[465.6s] Amen. That very first week we will
[469.9s] say Genesis chapter one is a wonderful
[474.3s] story of how God spend the very first
[477.3s] week which forms the blueprint for all
[480.6s] the time that will exist afterward.
[484.4s] Amen. Now you know that before Genesis
[489.0s] 1, time had never existed. Do you know
[493.6s] that? Maybe you didn't get
[496.0s] that. There was no time before Genesis 1
[501.8s] verse one. Before the Bible says in the
[505.2s] beginning, that's the beginning of time.
[508.2s] From then the time began to be reckoned.
[511.4s] But before then, we call it
[514.7s] what? Eternity. Amen.
[517.8s] So from that beginning going
[522.3s] into that side we call it eternity. No
[525.6s] counting of years. And when we shall
[529.0s] have spent a thousand years in
[531.2s] heaven and we come to this earth again
[535.1s] and we begin a very long long long life
[538.5s] into
[540.3s] eternity. There will be no accounting of
[542.6s] time. You've heard that song which
[544.8s] says there is no counting of time over
[548.8s] there. There was no counting of time.
[551.9s] But as soon as time began to be counted,
[554.9s] the very first part of that time the
[557.9s] Lord spent a
[561.9s] week to work. And when the Lord had
[564.9s] worked for six days, he rested on the
[567.9s] seventh. Amen.
[569.8s] And it made a complete one week of seven
[572.5s] days. And from that time to this date,
[576.6s] there has just been cycles of that very
[580.0s] very week. Amen. You know this song with
[583.0s] the morning has
[593.6s] broken like the first.
[597.6s] Now each morning that we see is like the
[600.6s] very very first
[603.2s] morning. Each Sabbath that we see is
[605.9s] like the very very first Sabbath. Every
[609.2s] Sunday that we see is like the very very
[611.5s] first Sunday. So the Lord spent a week
[614.2s] to demonstrate to us what we will be
[617.0s] doing from that time unto eternity.
[621.4s] Amen. Yeah. Sure. So that's it. So I am
[624.7s] saying the Lord has painted a clear
[627.3s] picture for humanity for what we should
[630.2s] be engaged in for the rest of the days.
[633.4s] How many days should we walk? Six days.
[637.3s] Genesis 2 8 the Bible says and the Lord
[641.4s] God planted a garden eastward in Eden
[645.7s] and there he put the man whom he had
[648.6s] found. Amen. Again apart from creating
[652.7s] the Lord does what is called planting.
[655.3s] Now you realize that planting doesn't
[658.2s] sound so much of creation
[660.7s] right or how many of you by planting in
[663.7s] the gardens they are creating but we
[666.5s] know the lord has put in principles and
[668.7s] by his powerful word he still makes
[671.5s] those plants to grow and that creation
[674.6s] and regeneration is progressed. Amen.
[678.2s] That's it. So the Lord also was the
[680.5s] first gardener or the first farmer. And
[684.0s] so I have said often times those who are
[687.5s] going to get engaged in
[689.6s] farming walk their work is the closest
[693.8s] in similarity with what God did. Amen.
[698.7s] Yeah. So Genesis 2:15 says, "And the
[701.7s] Lord God took the man and put him into
[704.3s] the garden of Eden to dress it and to
[707.0s] keep it." Amen.
[708.8s] I am asking you a question in this verse
[711.4s] 2 15. Had sin occurred in the
[717.0s] world? No. But the Lord made man to do
[720.2s] what? After he placed him in the garden,
[723.0s] he said to him to do what? To dress it
[725.5s] and to do what? And to keep it. Now you
[728.3s] know there were no weeds to make man so
[731.1s] disturbed. No, he wasn't worried about
[733.5s] very many things. There was no watering.
[735.9s] But the Lord wanted him to keep it
[738.4s] because the Lord was a creator and he
[740.6s] had made man in his own image. Man was
[743.4s] supposed to reflect God even in the
[745.8s] caring and making things to look more
[748.0s] beautiful than they were. Amen. Right?
[752.4s] So but after sin something else
[755.4s] happened. That's Genesis 3:19. The Bible
[757.8s] says to Adam. Now you know the story how
[760.7s] it happened. how they fell into sin and
[763.0s] how the Lord came in the cool of the day
[765.8s] and Adam and his wife hid and the Lord
[768.5s] said who told you that you are naked you
[771.5s] know the story now Genesis 3:19 says two
[774.8s] man to the man after the Lord had given
[777.2s] the punishment he began with
[780.5s] who yes he began with
[783.4s] who there were three parties to be
[785.6s] punished began
[787.6s] with now there was the woman there was
[790.0s] the serpent And then there
[792.1s] was the man. The Lord began with
[795.6s] who? Did he begin really with the man?
[799.0s] You go and find that. But now, let me
[801.6s] read it. 3:1 19. It says to Adam, "In
[805.5s] the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[807.8s] bread, till thou return unto the ground,
[810.6s] for out of it was thou taken, for dust
[813.3s] thou art, and unto dust shall thou
[816.4s] return." So the Lord says to the man,
[819.2s] you shall eat by sweat. I ask you this
[821.6s] question. Before sin was man eating by
[825.2s] sweat. No, that means the work that man
[828.0s] was doing was not the labor which over
[832.6s] taxes or which taxes our strength. It
[835.6s] was
[836.4s] rejuvenating. The work was like
[838.6s] recreation. You know when you are having
[840.6s] recreation, you're relaxing and
[842.9s] listening to music. Do you sweat? Do you
[847.0s] feel
[855.6s] tired?
[857.6s] Relax. That's what God intended. The
[861.3s] work shall be for mana. 3:23 says,
[864.3s] "Therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[866.5s] from the garden of Eden to till the
[869.4s] ground from whence he was taken." So
[871.8s] previously the Lord had said to do what?
[875.4s] to keep to dress and to to keep it.
[879.2s] Amen. But in the last portion he says to
[882.6s] do what? To till the ground from whence
[885.8s] he was taken. So we are very sure that
[889.0s] before sin man was not tealing the
[891.2s] ground. He was keeping it and dressing
[894.8s] it. Yeah. But after sin, he was supposed
[898.0s] to till it and from then uh he will get
[901.4s] his food through hard labor and the Lord
[905.7s] designed it that way for the interest of
[907.9s] lessening the effect of
[910.6s] sin.
[913.3s] Yeah. The Sabbath is a
[916.2s] testimony of work.
[919.1s] The Bible says in Exodus 20:8, remember
[922.3s] the Sabbath day to keep it
[925.3s] holy. Sixth day shalt thou labor and do
[930.0s] all thy work. But the seventh day is the
[933.8s] Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou
[936.9s] shalt not do any work, thou nor thy son,
[941.0s] nor thy daughter, thy man's servant, nor
[944.2s] thy maid servant, nor thy kettle, nor
[947.0s] thy stranger that is within thy gates.
[949.8s] For in six days the Lord made heaven and
[953.3s] earth, the sea and all that in them is,
[956.8s] and rested the seventh day. Wherefore
[959.1s] the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and
[962.1s] hallowed it. Amen.
[964.4s] Now you we've read this text over and
[967.4s] over
[969.2s] laying emphasis on the importance of
[971.5s] remembering the Sabbath and keeping it
[974.0s] holy.
[975.2s] Amen. Now today we are reading this text
[978.5s] to lay emphasis on walking on six days.
[982.7s] Now the Bible says how many days shall
[985.0s] you work? Six days. Now I want to
[987.9s] imagine that you are not going to work
[992.0s] for six days. Do you have any reason why
[994.7s] you should rest on the
[996.7s] Sabbath? So anyone who has not been
[999.8s] working for the six days does not have
[1002.7s] any warrant to rest on the on the
[1005.6s] Sabbath because otherwise he has been
[1008.4s] resting. But the Bible doesn't say six
[1011.4s] days shall thou
[1013.9s] rest. Does the Bible say
[1016.4s] that? So but human beings we love
[1019.8s] resting more than doing what? than
[1022.2s] working except children. Children are
[1024.3s] the only prime example of what the Lord
[1027.1s] designed. I'm talking about young
[1028.7s] children. Those who have not known what
[1031.4s] relaxing means. They do not love to
[1033.6s] sleep. They will only sleep as they are
[1036.1s] overcome by sleep, not by their own
[1038.2s] design. But we who have grown up, we
[1040.5s] know that living a leisure kind of a
[1043.8s] life is the ideal for us. Our education
[1046.8s] system has taught us that way that we
[1049.3s] need to be resting and you just need to
[1051.7s] work hard a little bit
[1054.0s] enjoy a vast life of idleness. The Bible
[1057.9s] doesn't teach that. The Bible teaches
[1059.4s] that work for how many days or six days.
[1063.5s] And in the Bible there is nothing like a
[1065.6s] vacation where you have a vacation to
[1068.6s] rest. No, it's about working for how
[1071.7s] many days? He who breaks the Sabbath on
[1075.6s] the seventh day is guilty of breaking
[1078.4s] the law of the Lord. And he who is idol
[1081.3s] on six six days is also guilty of
[1084.6s] breaking the very very law. Said that's
[1087.4s] that's too much on our side. But we need
[1089.9s] to think about
[1091.3s] that. Let's read further thoughts from
[1093.9s] the Bible concerning work. Proverbs 13:1
[1097.2s] says, "Wealth goten by vanity shall be
[1101.8s] diminished, but he that gatherth by
[1104.2s] labor shall increase."
[1107.1s] Amen. Wealth gotten by vanity,
[1113.2s] vanity. You know, there are many ways
[1115.5s] that the world is teaching us that you
[1117.2s] can acquire money or wealth.
[1126.0s] And one example is
[1128.4s] gambling. You place 100 shillings and
[1131.6s] you earn how much? A million. And many
[1135.7s] people want to do that, right? Because
[1138.6s] we love wealth gotten by vanity. The
[1142.1s] Bible says if you get wealth by
[1144.9s] vanity, what happens? It shall diminish.
[1148.9s] What does it mean to diminish? Now
[1150.9s] people who have studed
[1161.6s] business the one which is gotten by
[1164.0s] labor does
[1165.4s] what? It increases. Amen. Do you see
[1169.2s] that there is the blessing of the Lord
[1171.4s] in labor and not in idleness? The Lord
[1175.6s] recognizes only one moment in a week
[1178.5s] where you need to rest and that is the
[1181.5s] Sabbath. You work for six days and then
[1184.7s] you rest on Sabbath and that's what the
[1187.0s] Lord wants and you will have your wealth
[1189.8s] increase. You rest on the six
[1193.2s] days and your wealth will diminish.
[1196.6s] That's it. I didn't say that. It's the
[1199.2s] Bible. Proverbs 21:25 the Bible says the
[1203.0s] desire of the slothful killth him for
[1206.6s] his ants refuse to
[1208.8s] labor. The desire of the slothful. Now
[1212.0s] we said the other day a slothful person
[1214.1s] is a lazy
[1218.4s] [Music]
[1223.7s] person. So they
[1226.3s] keeping because you do not have. So when
[1229.3s] you pass, you say, "Wow, what a nice
[1231.2s] vehicle. I wish I had that
[1233.3s] man. It will kill
[1236.8s] you. If your hands will accept to
[1240.9s] work, you will have it." Amen. I'll get
[1244.4s] that quote someday
[1246.7s] um before we finish this. It's on
[1248.5s] councils on stewardship that the Lord
[1250.9s] has placed in the heart of man the
[1253.8s] desire to accumulate wealth and it's
[1256.6s] godly. I'm not talking about those who
[1259.3s] love the world. Talking about people
[1261.1s] like Abraham who will not make their
[1264.0s] wealth the object of their life. We
[1267.5s] talking about such people. That desire
[1269.6s] is divine to bring wealth together. And
[1272.6s] wealth means what? It means what you
[1274.8s] have, right? If it's clothes, if it is
[1279.2s] food, is that wealth? Yeah. 21 26 it
[1283.8s] says he coveted greedily all the day
[1287.9s] long but the righteous giveth and
[1290.4s] spareth not.
[1292.3s] Amen. So the slothful
[1295.9s] person covert
[1299.0s] greedily
[1300.5s] now greedily means what?
[1313.3s] Soed greedy all the day long. So what's
[1317.2s] the work of a slothful person? a lazy
[1319.6s] person just sit down and imagine things
[1323.0s] and keeps imagining like one time you
[1325.7s] know these were the thoughts I used to
[1326.9s] have when I used to go to school you
[1328.7s] know because I was very ambitious and I
[1331.1s] knew one time I'll have a very beautiful
[1333.5s] big house very nice car living in a very
[1337.0s] nice estate with very beautiful children
[1339.4s] and beautiful wife attending in a
[1341.6s] beautiful church those were always the
[1343.6s] ideas you get the
[1346.0s] point that's covetousness
[1349.6s] And that's
[1350.9s] laziness
[1353.6s] because it is the truth
[1356.4s] that there is nothing good that comes on
[1359.8s] a
[1360.8s] silver platter.
[1362.9s] Amen. Yeah. That's a statement which
[1366.1s] must can pass to be scriptures. That's
[1368.3s] how it is. That's what the Bible says
[1370.5s] here. If you are a lazy person, you keep
[1374.2s] desiring. You keep coveting. And the
[1376.9s] Bible doesn't want you to coveret. But
[1379.1s] if you are laboring, you minimize the
[1382.0s] moments of covetousness. Proverbs 14:23
[1385.0s] says, "In all labor there is
[1389.1s] what? Profit." In all labor there is
[1391.7s] what? Profit. But the talk of the lips
[1395.8s] tended to what? Pen.
[1419.4s] So the Bible calls us to labor and if
[1423.9s] you labor there is profit. Amen.
[1427.4s] No one should entertain the idea of
[1429.8s] idleness
[1433.3s] whatsoever. There are friends here and
[1435.2s] you are hearing messages on true
[1437.6s] education and you do not love going to
[1440.0s] school because you do not love
[1442.4s] reading and you don't love the school
[1445.0s] program and then you think because you
[1447.3s] heard this message now it's high good
[1450.3s] time I got an opportunity to quit. You
[1452.9s] get the point? So the reason for you to
[1456.9s] choose true education is because you
[1459.9s] found it an easy way to avoid work,
[1464.5s] right? The Lord judgeth the
[1468.0s] hearts. You see it so deep into your
[1472.1s] heart. And if you want to make a
[1474.3s] decision based on this
[1476.6s] friend, you are just an
[1479.6s] infidel. I will say to you personally
[1482.9s] and advise you go back to school and
[1486.2s] study. Did you get the
[1489.0s] point? If you are making that
[1492.5s] decision out of an avoidance of work, go
[1498.3s] back. You are not sincere in your
[1502.7s] heart. You are living a lie.
[1508.3s] Abraham was not leaving his place
[1511.9s] because he was avoiding work. You get
[1514.7s] the point. I hope that one no one will
[1517.6s] follow me late and say you are denying
[1520.5s] the truth. I am telling you a message
[1523.8s] that the Lord wants us to have in this
[1526.5s] time because God wants us to be sincere
[1529.1s] in our hearts. Not because we found it
[1532.8s] easy to follow this direction is why we
[1535.7s] left the other direction if that is the
[1537.8s] reason the lord will judge the heart I
[1541.1s] don't say further on that so we are told
[1544.5s] the words of the lip they tend to penary
[1548.2s] into
[1549.6s] poverty and poverty enough I'll still
[1553.1s] talk about
[1554.6s] idleness uh when we'll talk about
[1557.0s] self-sport proper that it is required of
[1560.5s] every steward to be faithful in the
[1563.0s] place where he is. Amen. So if the Lord
[1565.8s] shall call you to be a mother, you be
[1568.0s] faithful in your duties as a mother
[1570.5s] without idleness or
[1572.9s] laziness. 2 Thessalonians 3:10 the Bible
[1575.9s] says, "For even when we were with you,
[1578.6s] this we commanded you, that if any will
[1581.5s] not work, neither shall he do what
[1585.1s] should
[1586.0s] he should he eat.
[1590.0s] For we hear that there are some which
[1592.6s] walk among you
[1594.1s] disorderly, walking not at
[1597.2s] all, but are busy
[1600.4s] bodies. Now them that are such we
[1603.7s] command and exalt by our Lord Jesus
[1606.1s] Christ, that with quietness they walk
[1610.6s] and eat their own bread. Amen.
[1616.2s] The Lord is calling us and because this
[1619.2s] meeting is meant for the youth
[1621.7s] primarily our generation is cast. We are
[1625.4s] living at a gener generation of
[1628.3s] idleness where people will not want to
[1631.2s] work. People want to live. I'm not
[1633.9s] talking about the church only. The rest
[1636.0s] of the world people just want to live a
[1638.5s] careless easy lifestyle. Is that a true
[1641.1s] or false? We try to avoid work as much
[1644.6s] as possible. Paul says when they were at
[1647.8s] Thessalonica, what did they do? They
[1650.2s] commanded them that those who do not
[1653.1s] work should not do what? Should not
[1656.1s] eat. And he says, "For we hear that
[1659.2s] there are some among you who are busy
[1661.7s] bodies." You know what busy bodies
[1664.0s] are? You
[1674.9s] is about people who meddle with other
[1677.0s] people's businesses. Someone is busy
[1679.7s] doing their stuff, you are there busy
[1682.3s] speaking about very many many things.
[1685.2s] The Bible is saying to us that this life
[1689.0s] of busy boding and especially speaks
[1692.3s] categorically on women. When you go to
[1695.6s] Timothy now he says this is the best
[1698.0s] counel for us if you are found in such a
[1700.6s] category he says we command and exalt
[1703.5s] you by the lord do what in quietness go
[1707.5s] and walk and eat your own bread.
[1711.8s] Amen. The church should not
[1716.4s] encourage laziness at all costs.
[1720.3s] If someone is blessed with
[1722.6s] strength, let them walk and eat their
[1725.2s] own bread.
[1727.2s] Amen. You know, we will still talk about
[1730.5s] these things in depth for sure. But
[1732.9s] that's the word of the Bible. Amen. He
[1735.7s] said this time always passes quickly,
[1737.7s] but today I'll catch up with it. Let's
[1740.5s] uh we have a very wonderful reading here
[1743.5s] on CT 277. We begin with paragraph 1.
[1747.7s] I'll do some few readings and then I'll
[1749.4s] just end. The things of earth are more
[1753.0s] closely connected with heaven and are
[1755.4s] more directly under the supervision of
[1757.3s] Christ than many realize. The things of
[1760.1s] the earth, we are told are connected
[1762.2s] with the things of where heaven. Now you
[1765.1s] know Christ is that ladder which
[1767.0s] connects heaven and earth. And we are
[1769.7s] told that Christ is
[1772.9s] directly supervising these things than
[1776.0s] we can ever realize. He says all right
[1781.3s] inventions and improvements have their
[1784.8s] source in him who is wonderful in
[1787.5s] counsel and excellent in working. Amen.
[1791.0s] All right. Inventions and
[1795.6s] improvements. the person who invented
[1797.8s] this light and it's the right one. The
[1801.3s] Bible says it does it so
[1803.3s] well. The other day just to remind you
[1806.3s] perhaps we we can
[1808.2s] forget we were created by the Lord.
[1811.2s] Amen. Unless you guys believe in
[1814.0s] evolution. If you believe in evolution
[1816.5s] then you are exempted from thinking in
[1819.1s] this manner. You can think the other way
[1821.6s] around. But this is the thought. If you
[1823.8s] are created by the Lord, you received
[1825.9s] your life from who? From the Lord. And
[1829.2s] every ability and every gift that you
[1831.6s] have comes from who? From the Lord.
[1834.2s] Sometimes we say it's natural as though
[1837.4s] it invented itself across the way.
[1840.3s] Evolution is the only way one which says
[1843.8s] uh species keep acquiring uh advantages
[1847.9s] over other species. But the Lord
[1850.6s] equipped us with strength
[1853.3s] uh and efficiency and intellect and all
[1856.6s] these gifts which we can use. So if you
[1859.1s] can invent
[1861.5s] something the ability the intelligence
[1864.6s] you are using came from who? From the
[1867.3s] lord. We said every good gift comes from
[1870.3s] where? From above from the lord of
[1873.2s] lights. So we are told that every
[1875.4s] invention and every improvement have the
[1877.6s] associ him who is wonderful in counsel
[1880.2s] and excellent in workings the skillful
[1882.7s] touch of the physician's
[1885.2s] hand. So the doctor when he
[1888.8s] treats with that skillful hand we are
[1892.2s] told his power and nerve and muscle is
[1896.1s] knowledge of the delicate mechanism of
[1898.2s] the body is the wisdom of divine power.
[1901.4s] Amen. So if you have a thorough
[1904.2s] knowledge on anatomy and physiology and
[1906.7s] how all these things
[1908.7s] work, it comes from where? From the Lord
[1913.1s] to be used in behalf of the suffering.
[1915.9s] So the Lord has equipped you to profit
[1918.1s] with all. Amen. The skill with which the
[1922.3s] carpenter uses his tools, the strength
[1925.9s] with which the blacksmith makes the
[1928.5s] anvil ring come from God. Amen. You
[1932.0s] know, I'm reading these things and
[1935.3s] uh my heart really melts because when
[1938.1s] this message began, we didn't see these
[1940.6s] things so clearly as they appear right
[1942.8s] now.
[1943.8s] Amen. The Lord is opening the path of
[1946.7s] light. Doesn't the Bible says the path
[1949.0s] of a righteous man
[1950.8s] shineth further and farther unto the
[1953.7s] perfect day? Amen. That's it. So the
[1957.4s] Lord is saying if you are a
[1959.7s] carpenter the skill that you have comes
[1962.3s] from who? From the Lord. If you are a
[1970.3s] blacksmith. That strength comes from
[1972.6s] who? From the Lord. Whatever we do,
[1977.4s] wherever we are placed, he desires to
[1980.4s] control our minds that we may do perfect
[1983.9s] work. Amen. So wherever the Lord will
[1987.0s] place you, whatever you will do, the
[1990.4s] Lord desires to control our minds. Amen.
[1995.1s] Paragraph 2277 says, "Christianity and
[1999.2s] business rightly understood are not two
[2002.3s] separate things. They are harmony."
[2006.1s] You are not with me friends.
[2010.0s] Inana Christianity and business rightly
[2014.4s] understood are not two separate things.
[2018.0s] They are
[2019.5s] many. So Christianity and business are
[2022.5s] many. They are
[2024.5s] one. If you rightly understand them. If
[2028.1s] you think they are two, it's because we
[2030.4s] have not understood them. You get the
[2032.1s] point.
[2033.6s] Bible religion is to be brought into all
[2036.8s] that we do and say. Human and divine
[2040.8s] agencies are to combine in temporal as
[2044.2s] well as spiritual achievements. So while
[2046.8s] we cooperate with God on spiritual
[2049.8s] matters which we do when we pray, when
[2052.8s] we preach, when we study, when we do all
[2055.4s] these things, we cooperate with God. And
[2057.5s] so we must cooperate with him also on
[2059.8s] the temporal when we go and farm and we
[2061.9s] are digging and we are planting seed and
[2064.0s] we are pushing the nails into the wood.
[2067.1s] The Lord wants us to cooperate with him.
[2069.3s] They are to be united in all human
[2071.8s] pursuits in mechanical and in
[2074.8s] agricultural labors in meantile and
[2078.0s] scientific enterprises. Amen.
[2083.4s] Higher than the highest human thought is
[2086.9s] God's ideal for his children. That's a
[2089.8s] very famous quote on
[2091.8s] education. The Lord is not bringing us a
[2095.0s] true education which is totally inferior
[2098.2s] to the world. The Lord wants us that on
[2101.0s] mechanics and on science and on
[2105.6s] merchandise that mercantile means
[2107.7s] merchandise, right? Business. The Lord
[2110.9s] wants us to be the best of the best. I
[2114.6s] believe this personally that the Lord is
[2116.8s] not calling us to a true education which
[2119.4s] is inferior to that one which the devil
[2121.2s] has given to the world. What's the
[2123.7s] biggest problem with false
[2126.4s] education? It blends the truth with
[2128.7s] what? With error so that you cannot
[2131.4s] differentiate what is true and what is
[2134.4s] false. And that's where a true education
[2136.9s] comes and makes a correction. It is of a
[2139.9s] truth that in false education there are
[2143.4s] still elements of truth. Is that the
[2145.7s] truth or false? Yeah, there are still
[2148.1s] elements of truth. And that is why we
[2150.2s] can still even find things which were
[2152.8s] useful and they can still be used in the
[2154.9s] service of who? Because the devil
[2157.2s] managed to mingle what? Truth and what?
[2160.2s] And error. And for sure while we also
[2163.1s] drunk the
[2164.4s] error, we also got some element of what?
[2168.0s] of truth. So we are not like totally
[2171.3s] saying it is totally
[2173.9s] unfit. There are aspects of it which
[2177.0s] were in reality good. Is that the truth?
[2180.2s] But why should we go and partake the
[2184.1s] whole thing when the Lord is providing
[2187.2s] an option for that which is better
[2190.2s] without leaving that which was good over
[2192.0s] the other side. Over the other side.
[2194.1s] Amen.
[2196.1s] We have taken too long to implement true
[2199.3s] education in its practical
[2201.8s] aspect and that's why when we read such
[2205.1s] statements they do not appear in their
[2208.2s] true light but the Lord is calling out a
[2210.7s] people who will make a straight stamina
[2214.3s] not only in word of speaking about false
[2218.0s] education but in real practice of what
[2220.6s] it means to practice true education and
[2223.1s] it shall be proven I am pastor
[2225.6s] persed that before this arts history is
[2229.2s] closed, the Lord will allow us to make a
[2232.2s] clear demonstration of that practical
[2234.7s] true education which he brought to his
[2238.2s] people. It's been my prayer and I hope
[2241.1s] one time we shall show it so that people
[2243.7s] will not ask where shall we go from
[2245.8s] here. The Lord will
[2247.4s] say that's the place but we need to move
[2251.2s] so hastily so that when we shall say
[2253.5s] about mechanics and agriculture and
[2255.8s] science and business it will be
[2258.5s] practically in aspect that truly the
[2261.0s] lord has given us that field let's read
[2264.6s] further 21 paragraph 3 says there is a
[2267.8s] remedy for indolence what's indolence
[2272.1s] laziness and we have said this
[2274.3s] generation is characterized by laziness.
[2278.2s] We want to pick things which are easier
[2280.3s] to do than those ones which are hard to
[2283.1s] do. There is a remedy we are told and
[2286.6s] that is to throw off sluggishness as
[2290.5s] sin.
[2292.7s] Sluggish.
[2295.2s] Slugish. Like you want to do something
[2298.1s] but you are what? You are sluggish. This
[2302.3s] is the antidote for indolence.
[2305.5s] Throw off all sluggishness as sin that
[2308.6s] leads to pition. Just know that if I am
[2312.1s] sluggish, I will be destroyed because
[2314.9s] pition means to perish and go to work.
[2318.6s] So you throw sluggishness and you go to
[2320.6s] do what? To
[2322.6s] work. Using with determination and vigor
[2326.2s] the physical ability that God has given.
[2329.0s] So if the Lord has given you physical
[2330.5s] ability, use that to your determination.
[2332.8s] The only cure for a useless, inefficient
[2335.7s] life is determined, persevering effort.
[2339.9s] So if you've been idle, the only way to
[2342.3s] remedy that is to have a determined
[2345.2s] persevering
[2346.9s] effort. Life is not given us to be spent
[2350.2s] in idleness or self-pleasing. You might
[2354.1s] not be idol, but you might be choosing
[2355.7s] things which are pleasing to you. Right?
[2358.2s] The Lord doesn't want us to do that.
[2360.2s] Before us are placed great possibilities
[2362.6s] in the capital of strength. A precious
[2365.0s] talent has been entrusted to men for
[2367.4s] labor. So the Lord has committed you has
[2370.4s] entrusted you a precious talent. This is
[2373.6s] of more value than any bank deposit and
[2376.7s] should be more highly priced for through
[2379.1s] the possibilities that it affords for
[2381.7s] enabling men to lead a useful happy life
[2384.9s] it may be made to yield interest. says
[2388.5s] the strength that the Lord has given you
[2390.2s] is more valuable than the money you have
[2393.4s] deposited in the
[2396.7s] bank. You've heard this. I I I saw it
[2400.5s] somewhere. Someone was asking if you are
[2403.5s] asked to choose
[2406.6s] between brain now because it was said
[2409.7s] brain but let me just say knowledge and
[2412.6s] money. Which one will you choose?
[2418.8s] And
[2419.9s] definitely we will choose money,
[2427.5s] right? What about strength and money?
[2430.5s] What will we
[2433.9s] choose?
[2435.7s] Money. Because the dominance of our
[2439.0s] generation has taught us that money is
[2441.2s] the main
[2443.2s] thing. It's not friends. We need to
[2446.8s] think again. The Lord wants us to be
[2449.6s] useful in our lives. It's not just about
[2452.4s] money. Even the ecclesiast writer said
[2457.2s] the rest is not always to the fastest
[2460.6s] nor battle to the strong. Then he says
[2464.3s] time and
[2465.7s] chance for everyone.
[2468.6s] Sometimes we are engaging in business
[2470.3s] and we are not very successful for sure
[2473.7s] because the rest is not to the
[2476.4s] past. So that does not mean because we
[2480.2s] are not succeeding we should always
[2482.3s] think about money only because on all
[2484.8s] these things the Lord wants to make our
[2486.6s] character. You see the main thing to be
[2488.9s] gained is heaven. While on the long run
[2491.7s] we can sustain ourselves on the
[2493.4s] businesses that we earn. The main aim is
[2496.3s] to gain heaven.
[2499.4s] So that strength is of more value. You
[2502.2s] can lead a more useful life, balanced
[2504.8s] life than when you have
[2507.4s] money. No man has a right to sacrifice
[2510.9s] this talent to the corroding influence
[2513.2s] of
[2514.0s] inaction. All are as accountable for the
[2516.8s] capital of physical strength as for
[2518.6s] their capital of means. Now we said the
[2521.1s] other day there are several talents. We
[2523.3s] mentioned money. You remember that? We
[2526.1s] mentioned strength too. You remember
[2527.6s] that? So if the Lord commits to you
[2529.9s] strength and not money, he will require
[2532.2s] from you the use of strength. Now if you
[2534.6s] are idol, how many of us for sure have
[2537.4s] been blessed with strength, but we live
[2539.0s] a very idol, useless life. How
[2541.8s] many? Very many of us with a thought
[2545.1s] that I am still in school. You see, I'm
[2546.9s] studying. I'm going to work
[2550.7s] later. The Lord wants us to use this
[2553.6s] strength. Our schools of today have
[2556.5s] become so
[2558.0s] perverted that we think the brain is the
[2560.6s] main thing and not the brain
[2562.7s] actually it is the paper it is the
[2565.6s] certificate because if it was the brain
[2568.2s] there will be very many people even
[2570.3s] sneaking into universities to acquire an
[2573.0s] education so that they can use it in
[2574.6s] practical lifestyle without a
[2576.5s] certificate.
[2578.0s] But are there such cases where people
[2580.2s] sneak into the
[2581.5s] university because it will be useless if
[2584.1s] you don't have a paper? No one will
[2585.4s] recognize you. You get the point. So
[2587.6s] that the importance of the education of
[2589.4s] today is only found where? In the paper.
[2593.3s] Not in the person himself. But education
[2596.5s] should be found in your brother. If it
[2599.2s] is separate from you, it's useless.
[2602.2s] That's why he says hold on after
[2604.9s] education. Hold on it. Don't let it go.
[2608.7s] That's what the Bible says. But if it's
[2611.4s] packaged in a paper, that's as
[2614.5s] useless as any other
[2616.8s] paper. Because without the paper, you
[2620.0s] cannot prove that you are
[2622.4s] educated. You will need a certificate to
[2624.6s] come before the Lord to say, I'm going
[2627.7s] to bring my
[2629.3s] degree. The Lord does not need that. The
[2632.5s] Lord needs to equip us with education
[2635.2s] itself. And that education should be in
[2638.0s] us to be able to solve all practical
[2640.4s] life problems. That's
[2642.8s] it. I'm going forward. I just want to I
[2646.6s] think I still have maybe two 10 minutes.
[2650.9s] I have maybe two or three slides and I'm
[2652.8s] done. Judicious labor is healthful tonic
[2657.0s] for the human
[2660.4s] race. Judicious means temporate. you are
[2664.2s] not overwork because you were say we
[2666.2s] said we should avoid both extremes where
[2670.5s] the endeavor becomes just working for
[2673.3s] money. So we should judicious labor is a
[2676.2s] helpful tonic for the human
[2685.6s] race. Amen.
[2689.2s] It makes the feeble
[2691.2s] strong, the poor rich, the wretched
[2694.9s] happy.
[2698.4s] Amen. Satan lies in ambush, ready to
[2702.2s] destroy those whose leisure gives him
[2705.7s] opportunity to approach them under some
[2707.7s] attractive
[2709.9s] disguise. He is never more successful
[2712.6s] than when he comes to men in their idol
[2715.0s] hours.
[2716.3s] Satan lies in ambush and he is waiting
[2718.8s] to get you when you are not aware and he
[2721.4s] says he is always very successful when
[2723.5s] we are idle but when we are busy even
[2727.3s] the statement goes an idol
[2730.6s] mind is the devil's workshop and I think
[2734.7s] Luther said on the fundamentals of
[2737.2s] education he
[2738.5s] says the devil will find a work for idol
[2743.3s] hands so if you are hands are idol the
[2746.5s] devil will find a work for for
[2751.2s] you. The essential lesson of contented
[2755.3s] industry is in the necessary duties of
[2758.3s] life is yet to be learned by many of
[2762.2s] Christ followers. Let's redo that
[2764.7s] statement again. The essential lesson of
[2769.0s] contented industry in the necessary
[2772.6s] duties of life is yet to be learned by
[2776.6s] many of Christ followers. That statement
[2780.2s] places the learning in future knowing
[2784.4s] already that we have not learned this
[2787.6s] essential knowledge of contented
[2790.5s] industry.
[2800.7s] You've heard very many parents say that
[2802.9s] and they keep
[2808.1s] saying because we really think that our
[2811.3s] blessings from the Lord depend on
[2813.8s] university papers. Many people think
[2815.8s] that way, right? That without that
[2818.2s] paper, the Lord is not going to do what?
[2820.3s] To bless you. Go out and work.
[2823.7s] Be a useful person. Don't love idleness.
[2827.2s] But many people want to
[2829.6s] study to minimize their work in future.
[2832.6s] Not work. Are people going to study to
[2835.6s] work? The problem is if you work hard
[2839.0s] right now, you will
[2841.1s] be relaxing in future. Right? And many
[2844.6s] people are working hard in class to earn
[2848.4s] idleness in future. We are yet to learn
[2851.7s] as a people this essential lesson. It
[2855.4s] requires more grace, more than
[2858.2s] discipline of character to work for God
[2860.6s] in the capacity of
[2862.4s] mechanic, merchant, lawyer or farmer
[2867.2s] carrying the precepts of Christianity
[2869.0s] into the ordinary business of life than
[2872.1s] to labor as an acknowledged missionary
[2874.5s] in the open
[2876.8s] field. You got the statement. Was that
[2880.2s] right? Most of us desire to be
[2882.2s] missionaries, acknowledged missionaries
[2884.6s] in the open field. See, that's what we
[2886.4s] desire. But we are told which one
[2890.0s] requires more discipline of character.
[2894.6s] Is it working as a missionary in the
[2896.2s] open field? You know, when I'm a
[2898.2s] missionary and I'm walking around,
[2899.8s] everyone knows cuz gay is a missionary.
[2901.6s] Hey, hello pastor. Hello missionary.
[2904.2s] Hello to mission. I try to order my life
[2907.5s] because I keep meeting people that I
[2909.4s] speak about the gospel every now and
[2911.1s] then. That's my chief work, you see. So
[2914.0s] I rise up, I put on my suit, I put on my
[2917.1s] tie, I take my Bible, I walk visiting
[2919.8s] people and saying hello, Jesus loves
[2921.8s] you. Jesus loves you. What about a
[2925.1s] mechanic who has to deal with very many
[2927.8s] types of people and he must be an honest
[2930.9s] man and must witness for Christ
[2934.9s] still. The Bible is calling us to this
[2937.8s] persuasion that we should understand
[2940.0s] that wherever the place the Lord will
[2942.4s] place you, he requires you to work for
[2944.8s] him as a missionary. Amen.
[2947.4s] It is true that others will be called to
[2949.8s] be missionaries in the field that will
[2953.4s] be their chief work like Peter and
[2956.1s] John who said friends should we stop
[2959.7s] preaching the word and come and serve
[2961.8s] the tables why don't you look for people
[2963.9s] who can serve what the tables and when
[2967.3s] they went to look for people who can
[2968.5s] serve the the the tables sorry anyway
[2971.5s] for sure in our place those words look
[2974.1s] the same D and T and B and V and P they
[2977.8s] are the same. So whichever comes in my
[2979.6s] mouth just know what I'm trying to say.
[2982.2s] So say should we look for those who are
[2984.8s] going to serve the tables but those who
[2986.2s] are going to serve the tables the
[2987.8s] qualifications was that they must also
[2989.4s] be spirit filled. Amen. And so if you're
[2992.6s] going to work as a mechanic the lord
[2994.6s] requires that you also must be a
[2997.2s] spiritfilled person to work for him.
[2999.0s] Amen. It requires a strong spiritual
[3002.2s] nerve to bring religion into the
[3004.1s] workshop and the business office
[3006.6s] sanctifying the details of everyday life
[3009.1s] and ordering every transaction according
[3011.3s] to the standard of God's word. But this
[3014.1s] is what the Lord requires. Amen. And we
[3017.5s] said people are given many talents.
[3028.2s] The Lord will require of
[3034.4s] you. The Lord will require from you.
[3037.4s] There will be no excuse. So if you are a
[3040.8s] preacher and the Lord has given you also
[3043.7s] the gift of
[3045.7s] business, do business as you do what? As
[3049.8s] you preach. Because the Lord, if you
[3052.2s] will do business and you stop preaching,
[3054.2s] the Lord will require from you the
[3056.0s] talent of preaching. And if you will
[3059.3s] preach and you leave business out, the
[3061.7s] Lord will require from you the talent of
[3063.1s] what? Of business. Did you get the
[3065.3s] point? But others will be given one. Say
[3069.5s] for example, a brother has been given
[3071.0s] the talent of preaching. And it's only
[3073.2s] one talent. All of us expect him to be
[3076.3s] preaching. Amen. That's the only thing
[3079.0s] that the Lord will require from
[3095.6s] him. You understand that the Lord will
[3099.0s] require from us the highest of what we
[3101.6s] have heard. We must come to this
[3103.4s] conviction and personally I'm persuaded
[3105.8s] if we must preach the loud cry then all
[3108.5s] the talents must be brought into the
[3110.7s] work. Every part of our lives must be
[3115.1s] touched because God will send business
[3117.5s] people to that direction to that
[3119.4s] direction because how will I preach to
[3122.5s] the Muslims? Will I set up a crusade?
[3124.5s] Will they listen?
[3126.5s] But by my dealings, let me tell you one
[3128.4s] time when I completed my form four and I
[3130.7s] was doing a
[3131.7s] business and God gave me a privilege
[3135.7s] um to meet with a Muslim for sure. I'll
[3138.3s] go to him. I was buying stuff. I was
[3141.0s] doing food
[3142.2s] business. So I will be buying stuff. He
[3144.6s] was a wholesaler. So I'll go and buy. So
[3147.1s] we became good friends. So I'll come and
[3149.7s] say hey hello my I don't even remember
[3151.5s] his name. Uh but he was a good brother.
[3154.6s] Now one time he gave me a book. He said
[3159.0s] to me, I have a book for you here. I see
[3161.6s] that your heart is a very good. I will
[3163.9s] give you this book. It was a Muslim
[3165.5s] book. Now I had been praying that God
[3167.8s] will give me an opportunity to speak to
[3169.2s] this brother about the gospel. I thank
[3171.8s] that he already observed
[3174.4s] early that I was a good man. You get the
[3177.0s] point. You know that's preaching already
[3180.0s] and he will give me this book. While I
[3182.5s] was still standing in the very very
[3183.8s] shop, I was holding the book. The time
[3185.4s] is over. All
[3188.2s] right, I'll end it. I'm finishing the
[3190.8s] story and I end it. I was still standing
[3193.8s] on the counter and another pastor
[3197.8s] uh he was coming from a Sunday
[3200.7s] church and the pastor just came in. They
[3204.6s] were also friends. And then when he saw
[3206.4s] me with a book, he said, "Oh, what's
[3208.0s] that book?" He took it and when he just
[3211.0s] began holding it, the brother, the
[3212.6s] Muslim brother just came and took the
[3215.4s] book by force and he said this book I
[3219.0s] gave it to him. It should not just be
[3221.3s] held by any other
[3225.1s] person. I understood at that moment how
[3228.5s] much honor he gave to their book. It was
[3230.5s] not a Quran. It was just an adapted book
[3233.6s] giving some statements from the Quran.
[3236.8s] uh but in that contact if you are going
[3240.8s] to do business if we spend actually he
[3242.7s] left so we didn't have very much time
[3244.4s] together
[3245.9s] afterwards we God will have brought me
[3249.0s] into contact to the point that I could
[3251.9s] minister to him because definitely once
[3254.2s] he has observed that I am a good person
[3257.0s] definitely he will also want to know
[3259.4s] deeper if I said anything to him he will
[3262.4s] easily accept he actually taught me how
[3264.7s] to make rice
[3266.6s] Yeah. And actually I tried and it worked
[3268.6s] very well. So I agree that in business
[3272.1s] we can really reach people and if the
[3274.6s] Lord has given me that I really preach
[3276.1s] from the pullpit for sure. I go for
[3277.6s] public campaigns too. I also do little
[3280.2s] medical missionary and I do media
[3281.5s] ministry. That's what I do personally. I
[3283.2s] also do a lot of other work on because
[3285.8s] God really endored me in very many other
[3288.1s] things. And I appreciate that the Lord
[3290.6s] is calling for all these talents to
[3292.4s] finish the work. Don't hide the talent
[3295.2s] thinking that you must only work in a
[3297.0s] single place because the Lord will
[3299.2s] require the rest of the talents from
[3301.2s] you. I believe this is the balance that
[3303.0s] God is calling us to. The ministry will
[3307.1s] not
[3307.8s] suffer if we brought the talents will
[3310.4s] it? I mean the work of the
[3313.1s] Lord will not work will not go forward
[3316.4s] because our talents to work for the
[3318.3s] Lord.
[3345.6s] Yeah. Let's pray.
[3360.5s] Precious loving God in heaven, we thank
[3362.2s] you and we praise you. You are speaking
[3363.7s] to our dear hearts that we should give
[3367.8s] unto God what belongs to God and unto
[3369.8s] Caesar, what belongs to Caesar.
[3372.4s] We have very many talents which we've
[3374.2s] hidden for a long
[3375.9s] time and some are very practical and
[3378.6s] sometimes because of thinking they are
[3380.1s] very secular. We have robbed you of
[3382.6s] these talents. But Lord, you are calling
[3384.6s] us as a people in these moments of the
[3386.1s] loud cry to bring every gift to your
[3389.3s] service. Now we have very young people
[3391.9s] here with very
[3394.1s] uh huge strengths. We pray Lord may they
[3397.4s] be willing to surrender these strengths
[3399.1s] to you that you may use them to further
[3401.4s] their cause. Lord we pray give us
[3404.6s] comfort and encouragement. There are
[3406.8s] many things Lord that we have sacrificed
[3409.0s] for the interest of the gospel and Lord
[3412.1s] your promise is in this life we shall
[3414.0s] get 100fold and even in the life to
[3416.0s] come. Help to suffer loss to you we will
[3419.4s] say if it were not for the gospel we
[3420.9s] will be better. But Lord, help us to
[3423.1s] know that we will say if it were not for
[3424.7s] the gospel, we will be worse. I pray for
[3427.9s] our church. Help us to awaken to this
[3430.4s] realization, to say these opportunities,
[3432.7s] and to further your cause and to finish
[3434.3s] the work. Thank you for hearing our
[3436.2s] prayers. We pray in the precious name of
[3437.6s] Jesus Christ, your son. Amen. Amen.
[3439.8s] Thank you. God bless you.
