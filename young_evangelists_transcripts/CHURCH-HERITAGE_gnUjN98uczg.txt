FULL TRANSCRIPT:
discuss a topic called reduction and first time we saw that in the year 1961 when the national conference was being organized one of the things that was supposed to strengthen organization was that we need to empowered and still trying to realize and many there was a question that was raised that can baptize and build an insult I want to share before such words coming. audience because it means that it means that we should go and relax once more that are still connected with the institutions of This will come back and begin the church not maybe but May 21st, 3 BC, May 21st, 1889, 24. I wish to give some final text on the duties of deon. The servant is deities. build the servant of the church. These were first of all the seven are not plainly called but they were 53 53 but they were they were the first the first ever the contest showing that they was selected to the details of the church works temporal affair to relieve the elders. The root of the Greek word means signify dusty by running so that he gets covered by he of baptism he looks after the poor and take charge of the poor parts but he does not baptize that being a part of the duty of our minister. And that duty has not been given for a labor as a child. It is custom for the elder to have church. But in handing out the headlights the deacons assist as in the ordinance of the maybe the deacon can assistance he can do that but has not been given duty to administer any ordinance are you that number two I'm trying to answer the question is What? Yes. Thank you for that. Can you scroll? Then you make one another. This one I guess is okay. So you can do that you can let me say and this is an issue of God but I want you to understand without feeling access and do you understand that by virtue of his office as a deacon in the bridge only was an evangelist before or after he was chosen deacon. If by virtue of this deaconship he preach and baptize is here another example where the duties of the deon were not confined exclusively to the matters of the church also this question after to the prison. It means that Phil was also named a violist but has not been too much to anyone who has not that you have to be much in glory and worship before God's stand before their children may decree and pray in Jesus name I so much time and Christian But I may not read much but if you are against you I'm going investigate much I'm not going to be because I only investigation about the involvement and We were giving him the baptiz. So we determined that there were three groups. There were one of the groups that in every time they continue setting the time that one group there were also another group of we and we had already diverging 4 and separated. So the question now comes that4 and valley and return to that comes to the place and went into the most holy place and there was a group which was they indeed the interpretation was correct. worship but not that they were disappointed and reaching back in the state law and this biograph a b you topic I want our problems after this appointment what happened to page 10 Yes. Number 10. Number 10. 1844. There was someone who was calling human right. That is now a little farmer. Who was you? He is the advocate of the advocate of the advocate of the screen. Yes. originally exos the path of righteous said that exo was the instrument who God used to reveal the reveal to the eyes by giving adventist the meaning of the cleansing of the sanctuary with beds and white he was one of the deep thinking student who developed the seven adventist faith a self sacrificing servant of god an ardent evangelist and and faithful of all his long life in his devotion to Christ. He was at that time a mealist. Preacher. He was a meist. Let me continue. Early on the morning following October 22nd disappointment, Edson said to the few friends who may remain in his house, let us go out to the bar and so now after that was a calling friend I Then they shut the door and speak for them about their minds. They asked him to not while they were in the daily witness of the spirit that the prayers were heard. But less than an hour later as Edson and his neighbor of the about midway on the field was stopped and with a hand upon his shoulder. He turned his face to the gray skies and then there seemed to open a view in the third heaven. He saw Christ as the great high priest going from the holy place of the sanctuary to the most holy spir. He took his friend and he went to pray and after he disc how many heavens open and I saw that instead of our high priest coming out of the book to his side of him to come to this earth on the second month at the end of the days he for the first time enter that second of the sanctuary and that he want to perform in the most holy place coming to this earth so it Christ4 rising from place to death. Most knowing this, it continued his companion. He reached the other side of the field and the fence returned and he called, "Brother Hson, what are you stopping for?" Edson replied, "The Lord was answering our morning prayer." Then rejoicing his friend, he told him of the vision. They went on their way discussing the chapter, recalling one study they had made for the sanctuary and shaping up the Bible. Praise God. So now after4 we start our day but the event is where we start. So they try now to investigate that that is the problem they now must be established. So after what you see now 206 the paragraph is paragraph number four paragraph number one 26 1 SN 206 number the foundation of our many of our people do not realize how firmly the foundation of our faith has been laid. our faith. We do not understand the church. We do not understand the history of this church. That's why this our messed up and we have moved on that established. But when he said that how he said that my husband with this gives right this now how the violation of my husband right number two elder Joseph B number three it is called Stephan Pice who served in the ministerial and administrative work in the early days. Number three is father Andrews was Andrew. The father of J Andrews was called Andrew and the father of the father of Jus in the Edison and who were king noble and true after the passing time of 1844 start with the truth as foren please after the passing of 1844 Now comes Adventist who now want to know that he messed up and God now within us now everything is bringing up his vision that God has shown him and James is now clear and they compiled and made that this is what the Lord has shown So for us, we have no mind. It continued by saying, "I met you with them and we studied and prayed ear honestly until we remain together until late at at night and sometimes through the entire night praying for the lion and studying the the word. Again and again this come to study the Bible in order that they might know it meaning and be prepared to teach it with power. But there comes a point where they come to the point that's saying we can do that. Their mind is now saying that the spirit talks. The spirit talks the Holy Spirit. Now their mind is lost a person. Then now God is taking right now and revealing to him. Let us really say the spirit of the Lord will come upon me. He will be taken off in a vision and a clear explanation of the passages we had been studying would be given me with the instruction as to how we were to labor and teach. Thus light was given that help us to understand the scripture in regard to Christ, his mission and his priesthood. A line of stone extending from that time to the time when he shall enter the city of God was plain to me and I gave to others the instruction that the Lord has given me. Praise God. There now comes the birth of the seven. They now try to investigate that when the seven day what happened in 1844 at that time from that time 1860 there was nothing but they were calling theelves. So from that time now you are finding the parameters the founders of the seventh day because we are made on both sities are made with sanctuary and are made of combining the name to make this strong and forward in the book 1 284 the paragraph is paragraph number one. You see the three things that are going to make this one by 284 paragraph number one. Three things that is going to boil down 3 minutes 1 by 2 84 the paragraph is paragraph number one. You see what this means to call the adventist and what has made us what we are. I want you to read with me open very quick. You know this was founders of seven dynes. It says reading that three individuals three individuals stand out stand out as the founders of 7th day Adventist church. Praise God. They are the one that first God used to guide the sevenist church. Number one we have Joseph Bates. Number two we have James White. And number three we have Ellen W. These three individuals they are the ones who are standing that has made us what we are the foundation of their work. And I want you to mark this clearly. That's why in the last lesson we took our time to know the mite movement. Write with me. He said that the foundation of their work were laid in the great advent and his associate in first few years of 1844. 1840 is under the proclamation of the first and second of revelation 14. That is why that is where the foundation of this works. Then Joseph Bates retired sea captain become the apost you can write the career of Joseph Bates. Joseph B was a retired street captain and the one used to bring the children to this church which was known in the year 1845. Number two, we have a school teacher. James was a local school teacher. This was teaching. That is number two. And what was his ability with organization ability and clear perceptions? He has an organizing ability and clear perception. Number three, you are finding an anointing being with a gift of prophecy. An anointing be with a gift of prophecy. We were used by kind and molding the church. Praise God. this video. Why? Because I know on the other we look for the parity between the movement and also the Israelites. How many people did God use to the Israelites first? You know, Moses. Do you read the Bible? You know, Moses. When you read the book of Acts 5, I think it's 5:20 and the prophet s it means that for God to establish the church or God to establish that church in the wilderness, he had to bring up who is the providence as he brought what sister. Number two, who was being used to guide that church in the wilderness? It was Moses and for this church to be organized. It means that Moses must be available with James White. Number three was the work of doing the duties on the sanctuary and doing the duties of the work of God. He knew the group those three people God must use. That's why we finding the founders of this and for this gospel to go there must be about something. So what is the catalyst of this truth? What is going the review and held first appearing in April from the present room in 1849 and 1850. So the first president was established in the year 1849 and 1950 then developing into second review and er in the late 1815 was the catalyst. Praise the Lord. Some catalyst of reformation is publishing one which will not be one which will not be neglected in this church. We should not be neglected in this church. So we are the founders of this faith. Can you put for me apart books that are by teachers? Okay. Number one, the paragraph is paragraph number four. If your husband something very little, my time is going to be spent so much. Number four, you can write it. Number four which says that 8.5 someone can microphone I don't want to walk so much in 1845 in early 1845 was eventually understanding of the truth concerning the seventh day. at that point. So when did this child understand that that the Sabbath is the same 7th day 184 the respected captainsephected captain was the oldest member of our church he was the oldest member of our church and he became the first He became the first seventh president of conference president of Michigan 1861 in the year 1861 61 conference was organized and who was the president Joseph this I have no time there will help you number two we have Another one. Yes. Guess what? Even apologies of this 24 just number one from this light. It is called the of of 1821 and died in 1881 with 61 only 2 days. He was born in 1821 and died in 1881. Capable executive. We have not known of executive executive missionary leader James Springer White missionary of James Spring and he was a powerful public evangelist. He was public evangelist. When he was not standing public evangelism, no one can be insane. He was thankful public and uh not only did he participated with not only that participated in 1844 Joseph Bates and Joseph Bates and other in 1843 he done after the separation read so quickly. My time is really spent. The word applies to James and to other minister as to other minister minister. He was the publisher. He was the publisher of the first issue. Yes. President called President was established in 1849. It was established in 1850. structure. It was established in the 1850s sometimes. It was established in the year 18. He could have been the first president of the general congress. James could have been the first president of the general mark. James could have been the president of what but he declined the honor offered to him. He declared the honor offered to him by the brethren because he had been the chief advocate of the of church organization. When it's much time to present church organization, no one can get but president of the province by saying why did he did not he did not want people to think that he was making a joke. people to think that he was making a joke for he was president of the general conference. We will know that when we are talking about the presidents of the movement but he declined that I cannot be president because people may think that how organization it is because I want let us see what killed what someone who has been laboring for God can only die in 60 years. It is so painful. Why? Read that. However, however, between 1865 to 1863. Next, James White contribution to the church. James White contribution to the church. He was in the field. He was in the field of publishing work. Leadership. Leadership and administration. Yes. public association. It was he and his wife. Praise God. Go to my next 60 years. He he literally himself why he to such a state to such a state that it was difficult to persuade other men. It was difficult to persuade other men to the one thing he was qualified to do. people. He contin to do it so much but people fear that responsibility to manage. This tried to do this. He tried to do but was an interesting figure. Excellent. He was an interesting figure and excellent financial and manager and raptor and executive. He was executive committee. He was doing public evangelism. He was only he was also manating finance. He was old publishing house. He was only doing publishing outside. This man can live beyond 60 years with all those works. You are being told that was doing the work of 10 men. One person doing the work of 10 men that was not even financing work in the in the organization. That's why he took his time. He's going to work in the field. He's feeding his family. is going to work in the house. He's going to pray the man the church on this side and this side opposition. It made them to die in an early age. May God help us that James White we have here James White's not James White but now we have a lot of James White be for death in the year. Praise God. want to live be ready for death in the years and you're going to die soon in years. But if you don't die soon, it means you are not one. Let me let us proceed. Let us proceed. Let us proceed. We mention James White and another person. I'm going to the next but let me know that was this year 18 1854 and 1822 years in 1822 1852 when he was only how many years 22 he was already to do what to baptize as you can jour You remember that Jolo he was painting the house painting houses during the week and preach to several companies on Sunday. Praise God. That was the occupation of Jing. He was spent in houses and he went to pre the gospel and that's been economy. You can interact with Jer. You were one of the historians of you can write one number that's why they have to go and have the what the history of systematic we then what we have to determine on Jubation and enter the work of what the work of highlighted end of to become known somewhat as an as as historian. Mhm. He was the one historians among the among the let us go to the third person you just do investigation Jerry Nos J and there's a book called F O I number three. Yes. H O R Id4 number three national number we told that Jianos who was a serious who talented for studying of logical thinking came and led him to consider a career in law and politics. number three that you pray now was a bright sound. Still, stious promising young man. He was a promising young man. Are you promising? Are you studious? Are you right? Let's listen. His uncle His uncle Charles his uncle Charles encouraged him in his uh ear vision. He was really encouraging him in his vision to enter politics. It was told that quantities and if the little truck had not interveneed possibly we might have lost to the halls of Congress. A great author. He was really a great author. How many books have we proceeded? Religious leader. He was a religious leader and a missionary. He was a missionary. He was the first to fly to Westport. Let us read. However, however, Edward Andrews Edward Andrews his father his father had accepted the teachings of William Miller in the early 1840s. He was accepted the teaching of William in the year 1840s. And the whole family and the whole family consisting of the parents of two boys consisting of parent of two boys were numbered with the Adventist company in Paris and passed with them through their disappointment. Now with the uh now with the Stonewell family, now the Sto family, the uh Sepian Steing family and others, they accepted the seventh Sabbath, seventh day Sabbath. They accepted the seventh day Sabbath and were launched upon careers that took them far from politics ambition. Praise God. Amen. When you accept the Sabbath, you must leave politics. You must leave long education and you must leave career that are not according to the law of the law of God. Those are the darkers which you can take. We also have someone who is called but if we will find we talk on him. When you serve someone whom he loves when describing Stephan how is very clear distinctive in his word in his teaching you can you can go and inve spirit will not allow the one who might have something I'm only knew that she was who she was she was a prophet but we were little Verse 12, the words. This verse number six, verse two things, it reads it read so fast. And he said, And he said, "Hear now my words, hear now my words. If there be a prophet among you, if there's a prophet among us, I the Lord will make myself known unto him vision. I myself will make myself known unto him in what? In a vision. In a vision. And will speak unto him in a dream. And I will speak unto him in what? A dream." So it means that because we read on the other day 13 and by a prophet the children of Israel were led from Egypt to the promised land and also by a prophet they were preserved. It also means that for sevenist for them to come from midnight cry to the heaven to heaven it means that they must possibly labage. Praise God. Because God knew that children cannot pass the middle of4 without them having a problem without them having the problem. But you have only4 but the children of the children of Israel could not have come out of Babylon without Egypt without prophet. It mean that also cannot pass down a prophet. So they come and now God is calling a prophet and that first prophet who the prophet of this was called William. You write that king. The first one who called and gave a mission is someone who is called William Among the 485. to 485 a prophet among you. There's someone who is called William the first called number one. William Eoy. William Eoy, a member of the Freeville Baptist Church. He was a member of the Freeville Baptist Church who was preparing for the ministry. He was preparing for the ministry. Was given to vision in Boston in 1842. He was given vision in the year 1842. It means that before the before is passing the midnight pl mean that God had to give them what a prophet. Praise God. Amen. He was given a vision in the year 1844 passing what? 1842. One January 18. One January 18 and the other on February 4. The another on February 43. In the first of this revelation in the first of this revelation for he viewed the glorious reward of the faithful. He will review the glorious reward of the painful and the uh punishment of sinners. He will review also the punishment of the sinners. Not being instructed not being instructed to relate to others what was shown him to relate to others what was shown him. He told no one of his vision. He told no one of that vision. But he had no peace of mind. He had no peace of mind. In the second revelation, in the second revelation, he witnessed the multitudes on earth array before heaven's bar of judgment, a mighty angel with the silver trumpet. Yes. Uh in hand about to descend uh to earth by three steps. Yes. The books of record in heaven. Mhm. The coming of Christ. Yes. And the reward of the faithful. Yes. He was bidded. He was bidded. Thou must reveal those things which thou hast seen.

He was the first man who was given what? Given vision. He was the first man who was given vision. Can you continue? I want to take a point. Two days after this revelation. 2 days after this revelation, he was requested by the pastor of the uh Bloom Bloomfield Street Church in Boston to release this vision. Yes. Although he was a fluent speaker, Yes. he reluctantly complied. He reluctantly complied fearing that the general prejudice against vision. Yes. And the fact that he was Yes. will make his work difficult. You can read what happened. But God did not use what? God did not heal. But not saying that God has made another person who call has a false research advent movement the 182 paragraph Number one is the second person is using that after the death of William now he's choosing someone who calls for a very young man to do the work and GSM GSM 182 182 yes 182 about this time about this time there lived in Poland that is after the passing of Poland made a young man by the name of this going to deny you and what is going to be a barrier to you to do the duty of God as present to you. Three who firmly believe the Lord will come on the 10th day of the seventh month. He believed that God will come in 1844. He was a man of fine appearance. First he was a man. He was a man of fine appearance. Pleasing address. He he had pleasing address and quite well educated. He was quite what? Educated. Do did he did he hasated? Yes. Yes, he was like them that sitting before me. A few weeks before me and Christ a few weeks before midnight cry ended. The Lord came near and gave him a vision and gave him a vision in which he will show the journey of the admit people to the city of God. She will show the journey of the people to the city of God. with the angels messages of warning were given to him. Some messages of war were given to him which he was to deliver which he was to deliver to the people and he had also a view of the trials and persecution. He also viewed this point he also viewed the trials and persecution that will consequently follow if he was faithful in relating. It means that God showed him that if you are going to enter this coin you are going to be persecuted. what had what had been shown here he like Mr. Foy he like Mr. upon you whom we have read about shown three steps by which the people of God were to come fully upon the pathway yes to the holy city being a far a firm believer in being a firm believer in the Lord's coming in the Lord's coming in a few more days in a few more days as they s the the part of the vision relating to the three steps and to the pathway was to him unexplainable So we praying that he should be given a mission and how how the people of God have to travel to the holy city. I don't want to explain but that seemed to him explain that has been I have not been told to relate but what happened and being naturally of drug spirit he been naturally of spirit because of his well education he turned from the cross he turned from the cross. Yes. And refused to relate it. He refused to relate it. The vision was repeated the second time. Then the repeated the second time how also we God has been made to us but we are not doing the work that God has called us. Now the second time now that you might coins now being made. And in addition he was told that if he still refused to relate what he had been shown that if you still going to refuse the call that you have been given the burden will be taken from him. You are going the same is going to be taken from you and be given to one of the weakest of the Lord's children. It is going to be given to another one of the weakest one who will faithfully relate what God will reveal. He again refused. He again refused. Praise God. Amen. If you are going to delay the goal now it is going to be given to the or the weakest and after that now it was taken from we told that live up to the year 189 but he had no interest don't go and search it is in the he9 but he had no interest in religious things because You're going to refuse this God. You are not going to die soon, but you are going to have no interest in religious things. Praise God. You are going to have no but the holy city. Praise God. Amen. So now that God is giving the weak of the weakest now what vision the weak of the weakest now he's giving the vision God help us now God is to remain our mission now there is now we have an Amen. If anyone has any question I want to pray but anyone there's no question. We really thank you so much for having us indeed. If you not deciding for ourselves, we're going to take this gospel from us and to the weak of the pray that you give us strength to relate to what you have shown unto us. But only God will let the be done and live in us. We so pray that you let us all new lessons before us. But what thou allow me and allow us to read will glorify thy name. Let thy name be glorified in all things. I pray in Jesus name. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0s] discuss a topic called reduction and
[4.2s] first
[6.4s] time we saw that in the year
[9.6s] 1961 when the national conference was
[12.3s] being organized one of the things that
[15.9s] was supposed to strengthen organization
[20.8s] was
[25.5s] that we need to
[32.8s] empowered and
[35.6s] still trying to realize and many there
[40.8s] was a question that was raised that
[45.2s] can baptize
[48.2s] and build
[54.4s] an insult
[58.0s] I want to share
[68.2s] before such words coming.
[89.6s] audience
[98.5s] because it means
[101.8s] that it means that we should go and
[106.6s] relax once
[110.4s] more that are still connected with the
[113.4s] institutions of
[115.7s] This will come back and
[130.3s] begin the church
[135.1s] not
[140.1s] maybe
[142.4s] but May
[144.4s] 21st, 3 BC, May 21st,
[150.0s] 1889,
[164.8s] 24. I wish to give some final text on
[168.6s] the duties of deon. The servant is
[171.4s] deities.
[173.1s] build the servant of the church. These
[175.5s] were first of
[177.6s] all the seven are not plainly called but
[183.7s] they were
[186.6s] 53
[190.2s] 53 but they
[192.9s] were they were the
[196.6s] first the
[199.2s] first ever the
[202.0s] contest showing that they was selected
[205.4s] to the details of the church works
[207.8s] temporal affair to relieve the elders.
[211.7s] The root of the Greek word
[213.7s] means signify dusty by running
[218.3s] so that he gets covered by
[227.9s] he of baptism he looks after the poor
[233.2s] and take charge of the poor parts but he
[236.5s] does not baptize that being a part of
[239.4s] the duty of our
[246.9s] minister.
[248.5s] And that
[250.5s] duty has not been given for a
[256.0s] labor
[259.9s] as a child. It is custom for the elder
[264.1s] to have church.
[267.1s] But in handing out the headlights the
[269.8s] deacons assist as in the ordinance of
[272.8s] the maybe the deacon can
[280.1s] assistance he can do that but has not
[283.8s] been given duty to administer any
[287.4s] ordinance are you
[291.7s] that number two I'm trying to answer the
[295.3s] question is
[310.9s] What?
[318.6s] Yes. Thank you for that. Can
[324.0s] you
[328.1s] scroll? Then you
[330.7s] make
[337.8s] one
[349.0s] another. This one
[351.6s] I
[355.5s] guess is okay.
[358.7s] So you can do that you
[362.4s] can let me
[366.6s] say and this is an
[369.2s] issue of God but I want you to
[372.9s] understand without
[375.7s] feeling
[381.2s] access
[383.1s] and do you understand that by virtue of
[386.2s] his office as a deacon in the bridge
[389.3s] only was an evangelist before or after
[393.1s] he was chosen deacon.
[395.5s] If by virtue of this deaconship he
[398.4s] preach and baptize is here another
[402.0s] example where the duties of the deon
[405.1s] were not confined exclusively to the
[407.3s] matters of the church also this
[420.8s] question after to
[425.2s] the prison. It means
[428.9s] that Phil was also named a violist
[436.1s] but has not been too much to
[454.6s] anyone who has not
[468.6s] that you have to
[471.6s] be
[485.2s] much in glory and
[489.2s] worship before God's stand before their
[493.6s] children may decree and pray in Jesus
[502.6s] name
[506.1s] I so
[508.7s] much
[510.3s] time
[511.9s] and Christian
[515.0s] But I may not read much but if you are
[518.2s] against
[520.7s] you I'm going investigate much I'm not
[524.4s] going to be because I
[535.9s] only
[540.4s] investigation about the involvement and
[545.5s] We were giving him the
[566.6s] baptiz. So we determined that there were
[570.2s] three groups. There were one of the
[572.5s] groups that in every time they continue
[575.5s] setting the time that one group
[582.3s] there were also another group
[586.8s] of
[590.0s] we and we
[593.0s] had
[596.8s] already diverging
[601.8s] 4 and separated. So the question now
[606.2s] comes
[608.8s] that4
[610.6s] and valley and return
[613.7s] to that comes to the place and went into
[619.0s] the most holy place and there was a
[622.2s] group which
[624.1s] was
[626.4s] they indeed the interpretation was
[629.1s] correct. worship but
[632.5s] not
[635.8s] that they were
[640.2s] disappointed and reaching
[655.7s] back in the state
[658.9s] law and this
[665.4s] biograph a b you topic I
[671.3s] want our problems after this appointment
[674.6s] what happened to page
[680.9s] 10
[682.4s] Yes. Number
[686.2s] 10. Number
[693.2s] 10.
[695.0s] 1844. There was someone who was
[698.2s] calling human right. That is
[707.3s] now a little
[710.0s] farmer. Who
[714.1s] was you? He is the advocate of
[720.0s] the advocate of
[727.8s] the advocate of
[731.2s] the
[736.7s] screen. Yes.
[741.0s] originally exos the path of righteous
[745.0s] said that exo was the instrument who God
[748.8s] used to reveal the reveal to the eyes by
[752.6s] giving adventist the meaning of the
[755.3s] cleansing of the sanctuary with beds and
[758.8s] white he was one of the deep thinking
[761.9s] student who developed the seven
[764.3s] adventist faith a self sacrificing
[767.2s] servant of god an ardent
[769.8s] evangelist and and faithful of all his
[773.3s] long life in his devotion to Christ. He
[776.2s] was at that time a mealist.
[779.7s] Preacher. He was a meist. Let me
[782.2s] continue. Early on the morning following
[785.0s] October 22nd disappointment, Edson said
[788.3s] to the few friends who may remain in his
[790.6s] house, let us go out to the bar
[794.5s] and
[796.4s] so
[798.5s] now
[803.6s] after that was
[806.8s] a calling
[811.1s] friend I
[812.9s] Then
[813.8s] they shut the door and speak
[818.4s] for them about their minds. They asked
[822.6s] him to not while they were in the
[827.2s] daily witness of the spirit that the
[829.8s] prayers were heard. But less than an
[832.0s] hour later as Edson and
[836.3s] his neighbor of
[839.3s] the about midway on the
[842.5s] field was
[844.3s] stopped and with a hand upon his
[846.8s] shoulder. He turned his face to the gray
[850.2s] skies and then there seemed to open a
[853.5s] view in the third heaven. He saw Christ
[856.3s] as the great high priest going from the
[859.2s] holy place of the sanctuary to the most
[862.2s] holy spir.
[867.7s] He took his friend and he went to pray
[870.4s] and
[876.8s] after he
[890.3s] disc how many
[893.4s] heavens
[901.7s] open and I saw
[904.3s] that instead of our high priest coming
[907.5s] out of the book to his side of him to
[911.0s] come to this earth on the second month
[914.2s] at the end of the days he for the first
[917.4s] time enter that second of the sanctuary
[922.2s] and that he want to perform in the most
[924.8s] holy
[928.3s] place coming to this earth so it Christ4
[935.0s] rising from place to death. Most knowing
[938.4s] this, it
[940.2s] continued his companion. He reached the
[943.6s] other side of the field and the fence
[945.9s] returned and he called, "Brother Hson,
[949.4s] what are you stopping for?" Edson
[951.8s] replied, "The Lord was answering our
[954.5s] morning prayer." Then rejoicing his
[956.8s] friend, he told him of the vision. They
[960.2s] went on their way discussing the
[962.4s] chapter, recalling one study they had
[966.6s] made for the sanctuary and shaping up
[969.2s] the
[970.9s] Bible. Praise God.
[975.0s] So now
[979.8s] after4 we
[985.2s] start our
[987.3s] day but the event is where we start. So
[992.1s] they try now to
[993.7s] investigate that that is the problem
[998.6s] they
[1000.9s] now must be established.
[1005.2s] So
[1007.3s] after
[1010.4s] what you see
[1021.7s] now
[1024.0s] 206 the paragraph is paragraph number
[1027.6s] four paragraph number
[1033.3s] one 26 1
[1036.8s] SN
[1039.0s] 206
[1044.8s] number the foundation of
[1053.0s] our many of our people do not realize
[1057.2s] how firmly the foundation of our faith
[1060.7s] has been laid.
[1064.6s] our faith. We do not understand the
[1067.6s] church. We do not understand the history
[1069.8s] of this church. That's why this our
[1072.8s] messed up and we have moved on that
[1076.6s] established. But
[1078.9s] when he said
[1087.0s] that
[1088.7s] how he said that my husband with this
[1092.0s] gives right this now how the violation
[1096.0s] of my husband right number two elder
[1100.6s] Joseph B number three it is called
[1104.4s] Stephan Pice who served in the
[1107.6s] ministerial and administrative work in
[1110.2s] the early days. Number three is father
[1113.3s] Andrews was Andrew. The father of J
[1117.3s] Andrews was
[1118.9s] called Andrew and the father of the
[1124.2s] father of
[1126.0s] Jus in the Edison
[1129.2s] and who were king noble and
[1134.7s] true after the passing time of 1844
[1138.4s] start with the truth as
[1140.8s] foren
[1142.4s] please after the passing of 1844
[1146.2s] Now
[1147.3s] comes Adventist who now want to know
[1150.2s] that he messed up
[1152.8s] and God now within
[1157.5s] us now everything is bringing up his
[1160.8s] vision that God has shown him and James
[1164.6s] is now
[1169.5s] clear and they compiled and made that
[1172.6s] this is what the Lord has shown
[1175.8s] So for us, we
[1178.4s] have no mind. It continued by saying, "I
[1182.8s] met you with them and we studied and
[1185.4s] prayed ear honestly until we remain
[1188.1s] together until late at
[1201.1s] at night and sometimes through the
[1203.4s] entire night praying for the lion and
[1205.8s] studying the the word. Again and again
[1209.8s] this come to study the Bible in order
[1213.4s] that they might know it meaning and be
[1216.2s] prepared to teach it with power. But
[1219.3s] there comes a point where they come to
[1221.5s] the point that's saying we can do that.
[1225.8s] Their mind is
[1229.1s] now saying that the spirit
[1232.4s] talks. The spirit
[1234.6s] talks the Holy Spirit. Now their mind is
[1238.2s] lost a
[1240.0s] person. Then now God
[1243.4s] is taking right now and revealing to
[1247.1s] him. Let us really say the spirit of the
[1249.7s] Lord will come upon me. He will be taken
[1252.6s] off in a vision and a clear explanation
[1255.5s] of the passages we had been studying
[1258.6s] would be given me with the instruction
[1261.1s] as to how we were to labor and teach.
[1265.0s] Thus light was given that help us to
[1268.2s] understand the scripture in regard to
[1270.0s] Christ, his mission and his priesthood.
[1273.7s] A line of stone extending from that time
[1276.8s] to the time when he shall enter the city
[1278.9s] of God was plain to me and I gave to
[1282.1s] others the instruction that the Lord has
[1284.9s] given me. Praise God. There now comes
[1288.2s] the birth of the seven. They now try to
[1291.6s] investigate that when the seven day what
[1295.5s] happened in
[1299.0s] 1844 at that time from that time 1860
[1303.2s] there was
[1304.4s] nothing but they were calling
[1309.2s] theelves. So from that time now you are
[1312.2s] finding the parameters the founders of
[1314.5s] the seventh
[1318.2s] day because we are made on both sities
[1323.0s] are made
[1324.9s] with sanctuary and are made of combining
[1328.3s] the name to
[1330.5s] make
[1333.9s] this strong and
[1337.2s] forward in the book 1 284 the paragraph
[1341.5s] is paragraph number one. You see the
[1344.3s] three things that are going to make this
[1347.2s] one by
[1349.0s] 284 paragraph number one. Three things
[1352.8s] that is going to boil down 3 minutes 1
[1357.4s] by 2 84 the paragraph is paragraph
[1361.3s] number one. You see what this means to
[1363.8s] call the adventist and what has made us
[1367.7s] what we are. I want you to read with me
[1370.8s] open very
[1373.8s] quick. You know this was founders of
[1376.6s] seven dynes. It says reading that three
[1382.5s] individuals three individuals stand out
[1387.0s] stand out as the founders of 7th day
[1390.6s] Adventist church. Praise God. They are
[1394.4s] the one that first God used to guide the
[1398.4s] sevenist church. Number one we have
[1401.1s] Joseph
[1402.4s] Bates. Number two we have James White.
[1405.7s] And number three we have Ellen W. These
[1409.1s] three individuals they are the ones who
[1411.0s] are standing that has made us what we
[1413.9s] are the foundation of their work. And I
[1416.8s] want you to mark this clearly. That's
[1418.8s] why in the last lesson we took our time
[1420.7s] to know the mite movement. Write with
[1424.1s] me. He said that the foundation of their
[1426.7s] work were laid in the great
[1431.9s] advent and his associate in first few
[1435.8s] years of
[1437.6s] 1844. 1840 is under the proclamation of
[1440.5s] the first and second of revelation 14.
[1444.8s] That is why that is where the foundation
[1447.2s] of this works.
[1451.2s] Then Joseph Bates retired sea captain
[1455.2s] become the
[1457.2s] apost you can write the career of Joseph
[1460.5s] Bates. Joseph B was a retired street
[1464.0s] captain and the one used to bring the
[1467.9s] children to this church which was known
[1470.7s] in the year 1845.
[1474.2s] Number two, we have a school
[1478.0s] teacher. James was a local school
[1481.5s] teacher. This was
[1484.1s] teaching. That is number two. And what
[1487.4s] was his ability with organization
[1490.4s] ability and clear
[1493.1s] perceptions? He has an organizing
[1495.7s] ability and clear perception. Number
[1497.8s] three, you are finding an anointing
[1500.2s] being with a gift of
[1503.1s] prophecy. An anointing be with a gift of
[1507.9s] prophecy. We were used by kind and
[1512.2s] molding
[1513.6s] the church. Praise God. this video. Why?
[1518.8s] Because I know on the other we look for
[1521.4s] the parity between the movement and also
[1525.2s] the
[1526.3s] Israelites. How many people did God use
[1529.0s] to the
[1530.7s] Israelites first? You
[1533.6s] know,
[1537.5s] Moses. Do you read the Bible? You know,
[1540.6s] Moses.
[1542.9s] When you read the book of Acts 5, I
[1544.8s] think it's
[1546.1s] 5:20 and the prophet s it means that for
[1551.8s] God to establish the church or God to
[1554.3s] establish that church in the wilderness,
[1556.2s] he had to bring up who is the providence
[1559.0s] as he brought
[1560.4s] what sister. Number two, who was being
[1564.2s] used to guide that church in the
[1566.3s] wilderness? It was Moses and for this
[1569.2s] church to be organized. It means that
[1571.4s] Moses must be available with James
[1574.6s] White. Number three was the work
[1578.3s] of doing the duties on the sanctuary
[1583.5s] and doing the duties of the work of God.
[1586.9s] He knew the
[1589.8s] group those three people God must use.
[1593.1s] That's why we finding the founders of
[1594.9s] this and for this gospel to go there
[1598.4s] must
[1601.6s] be about
[1618.2s] something. So what is the catalyst of
[1620.6s] this truth?
[1622.4s] What
[1625.6s] is
[1630.1s] going the review and held first
[1633.5s] appearing in April from the present room
[1637.4s] in 1849 and
[1640.2s] 1850. So the
[1642.3s] first president was established in the
[1645.4s] year 1849 and
[1647.6s] 1950 then developing into second review
[1652.2s] and er in the late 1815 was the
[1656.8s] catalyst. Praise the Lord. Some catalyst
[1659.8s] of reformation is publishing one which
[1662.8s] will not be one which will not be
[1665.6s] neglected in this
[1668.0s] church. We should not be neglected in
[1670.6s] this church. So we are the founders of
[1674.0s] this faith.
[1676.1s] Can you put for me
[1678.7s] apart books that are by
[1682.3s] teachers? Okay. Number one, the
[1685.0s] paragraph is paragraph number four. If
[1687.9s] your
[1689.7s] husband something very little, my time
[1692.6s] is going to be spent so
[1695.9s] much. Number four, you can write
[1702.1s] it. Number
[1711.8s] four which says that
[1719.8s] 8.5 someone can microphone I don't want
[1722.5s] to walk so
[1725.9s] much in
[1729.2s] 1845 in early 1845
[1734.7s] was
[1736.6s] eventually understanding of the truth
[1739.6s] concerning the seventh day. at that
[1742.5s] point. So when did this child understand
[1745.4s] that that the Sabbath is the same 7th
[1748.4s] day
[1756.3s] 184 the respected
[1761.7s] captainsephected captain was the oldest
[1764.6s] member of our church he was the oldest
[1768.0s] member of our church and he became the
[1771.0s] first
[1773.0s] He became the first seventh president of
[1777.9s] conference president of Michigan
[1781.4s] 1861 in the year
[1784.3s] 1861 61 conference was organized and who
[1789.8s] was the
[1791.8s] president Joseph this I have no time
[1796.2s] there will help you number two we have
[1799.7s] Another
[1800.8s] one. Yes. Guess what? Even
[1816.7s] apologies of
[1819.2s] this 24 just number
[1824.4s] one from this light. It is
[1828.9s] called the
[1836.1s] of
[1841.0s] of
[1842.5s] 1821 and died in 1881 with
[1847.4s] 61 only 2 days. He was born in 1821 and
[1853.8s] died in 1881.
[1865.1s] Capable executive. We have not known of
[1871.9s] executive executive missionary leader
[1875.2s] James Springer White missionary of James
[1879.4s] Spring
[1881.6s] and he was a powerful public evangelist.
[1885.7s] He was public evangelist. When he was
[1889.4s] not standing public evangelism, no one
[1892.0s] can be insane. He was thankful public
[1897.0s] and uh not only did he participated with
[1903.3s] not only that participated in 1844
[1906.6s] Joseph Bates and Joseph Bates and
[1914.0s] other in
[1917.0s] 1843 he
[1921.0s] done after the separation
[1934.1s] read so quickly. My time is really
[1937.2s] spent. The word applies to James and to
[1941.8s] other minister as to other minister
[1945.0s] minister.
[1948.6s] He was the publisher. He was the
[1950.2s] publisher of the
[1952.1s] first issue.
[1956.0s] Yes.
[1957.6s] President called President was
[1959.5s] established in 1849.
[1965.6s] It was established in 1850.
[1968.3s] structure. It was established in the
[1973.2s] 1850s
[1974.9s] sometimes. It was established in the
[1977.0s] year 18.
[1980.1s] He could have been the first president
[1981.9s] of the general congress. James could
[1984.2s] have been the first president of the
[1986.0s] general
[1987.7s] mark. James could have been the
[1990.3s] president of what
[1992.8s] but he declined the honor offered to
[1994.9s] him. He declared the honor offered to
[1997.3s] him by the brethren because he had been
[2000.7s] the chief advocate of the of church
[2003.0s] organization. When it's much time to
[2005.3s] present church organization, no one can
[2009.4s] get
[2012.5s] but president of the province by
[2016.0s] saying why did he did not he did not
[2021.4s] want people to think that he was making
[2023.8s] a joke.
[2025.5s] people to think that he was making a
[2027.2s] joke for
[2029.0s] he was president of the general
[2031.1s] conference. We will know that when we
[2033.2s] are talking about the presidents of the
[2035.3s] movement but he declined that I cannot
[2038.4s] be president because people may think
[2040.0s] that how organization it is because I
[2044.8s] want let us see what killed
[2048.5s] what someone who has been laboring for
[2051.0s] God can only die in 60 years. It is so
[2054.1s] painful. Why? Read that. However,
[2056.8s] however, between 1865 to 1863. Next,
[2061.6s] James White contribution to the church.
[2063.7s] James White contribution to the church.
[2065.4s] He was in the field.
[2068.1s] He was in the field of publishing work.
[2071.6s] Leadership.
[2073.4s] Leadership and administration.
[2078.4s] Yes.
[2080.0s] public association. It was he and his
[2083.7s] wife. Praise God.
[2091.5s] Go to my
[2105.2s] next 60 years. He he literally
[2126.7s] himself
[2128.2s] why he
[2131.9s] to such a state to such a state that it
[2138.0s] was difficult to persuade other men. It
[2140.5s] was difficult to persuade other men to
[2142.9s] the one thing he was qualified to do.
[2165.7s] people. He
[2188.8s] contin to do it so much but people fear
[2192.7s] that
[2195.1s] responsibility to manage.
[2197.0s] This tried to do this. He tried to do
[2199.6s] but was an interesting figure.
[2202.8s] Excellent. He was an interesting figure
[2206.4s] and excellent financial and manager and
[2211.6s] raptor and
[2215.2s] executive. He was executive committee.
[2218.9s] He was doing public evangelism. He was
[2222.3s] only he was also manating finance. He
[2226.5s] was old publishing house. He was only
[2229.9s] doing publishing
[2234.0s] outside. This man can live beyond 60
[2236.6s] years with all those works. You are
[2239.0s] being told that was doing the work of 10
[2241.9s] men. One person doing the work of 10 men
[2245.6s] that was not even financing work in the
[2248.7s] in the organization. That's why he took
[2250.5s] his time. He's going to work in the
[2252.5s] field. He's feeding his family. is going
[2255.3s] to work in the house. He's going to pray
[2258.0s] the man the church on this side and this
[2262.1s] side opposition. It made them to die in
[2266.5s] an early age. May God help us that James
[2270.4s] White we have here James White's not
[2273.9s] James White but now we have a lot of
[2275.7s] James White be for death in the year.
[2278.6s] Praise God. want to live be ready for
[2282.2s] death in the years and you're going to
[2283.8s] die soon in years. But if you don't die
[2286.9s] soon, it means you are not
[2290.0s] one. Let me let us
[2292.4s] proceed. Let us proceed.
[2299.1s] Let us proceed. We mention James White
[2303.5s] and another
[2305.8s] person. I'm going to the next but let
[2312.0s] me know that was this year
[2317.5s] 18 1854 and
[2321.0s] 1822 years in
[2324.6s] 1822 1852 when he was only how many
[2327.7s] years 22 he was already to do what to
[2331.4s] baptize as you
[2334.0s] can jour
[2336.5s] You remember that
[2338.0s] Jolo he was painting the house painting
[2342.4s] houses during the week and preach to
[2346.4s] several companies on Sunday. Praise God.
[2350.6s] That was the occupation of
[2355.9s] Jing. He was spent in houses and he went
[2360.7s] to pre the gospel and that's been

[2430.6s] He was the one historians among the
[2434.8s] among the let us go to the third person
[2439.0s] you just do investigation Jerry

[2452.4s] I number
[2456.3s] three. Yes. H O
[2460.5s] R
[2466.1s] Id4 number three
[2475.1s] national
[2477.2s] number we told that
[2480.8s] Jianos who was a
[2484.0s] serious who talented for studying of
[2486.6s] logical thinking came and led him to
[2489.0s] consider a career in law and politics.
[2502.2s] number three
[2505.6s] that you pray now
[2525.8s] was a bright sound. Still, stious
[2530.4s] promising young man. He was a promising
[2533.0s] young man. Are you promising? Are you
[2535.6s] studious? Are you right?
[2538.9s] Let's listen. His uncle His uncle
[2541.4s] Charles
[2543.1s] his uncle Charles encouraged him in his
[2546.3s] uh ear vision. He was really encouraging
[2549.2s] him in his vision to enter politics. It
[2552.1s] was told
[2553.3s] that quantities and if the little truck
[2557.2s] had not interveneed possibly we might
[2561.4s] have lost to the halls of Congress. A
[2564.7s] great author. He was really a great
[2567.5s] author. How many books have
[2569.6s] we proceeded? Religious leader. He was a
[2572.8s] religious leader and a missionary. He
[2575.0s] was a missionary. He was the first to
[2577.2s] fly to Westport.
[2581.0s] Let us read. However, however, Edward
[2584.1s] Andrews Edward Andrews his father his
[2586.7s] father had accepted the teachings of
[2588.5s] William Miller in the early 1840s. He
[2591.2s] was accepted the teaching of William in
[2593.0s] the year 1840s. And the whole family and
[2596.2s] the whole family consisting of the
[2598.2s] parents of two boys consisting of parent
[2600.9s] of two boys were numbered with the
[2602.7s] Adventist company in Paris and passed
[2607.3s] with them through their disappointment.
[2610.6s] Now with the uh now with the Stonewell
[2613.4s] family, now the Sto family, the uh
[2617.2s] Sepian Steing family
[2620.3s] and others, they accepted the seventh
[2623.4s] Sabbath, seventh day Sabbath. They
[2625.1s] accepted the seventh day Sabbath and
[2627.2s] were launched upon careers that took
[2630.2s] them far from politics ambition. Praise
[2633.0s] God. Amen. When you accept the Sabbath,
[2635.7s] you must leave politics. You must leave
[2638.4s] long education and you must leave career
[2641.1s] that are not according to the law of the
[2643.8s] law of
[2645.3s] God. Those are the darkers which you can
[2649.6s] take. We also have someone who is
[2657.7s] called but if we will find we talk on
[2660.6s] him. When you serve someone whom he
[2664.6s] loves when describing
[2669.3s] Stephan how is very clear distinctive in
[2672.4s] his word in his teaching you can you can
[2675.1s] go and inve spirit will not
[2678.1s] allow
[2680.0s] the one
[2681.8s] who might
[2687.8s] have
[2693.1s] something I'm
[2697.5s] only knew that she was who she was she
[2702.5s] was a prophet but we were little Verse
[2706.4s] 12, the words. This verse number six,
[2709.9s] verse two things, it reads it read so
[2712.2s] fast. And he said, And he said, "Hear
[2714.7s] now my words, hear now my words. If
[2716.8s] there be a prophet among you, if there's
[2719.0s] a prophet among us, I the Lord will make
[2722.3s] myself known unto him vision. I myself
[2725.8s] will make myself known unto him in what?
[2728.2s] In a vision. In a vision. And will speak
[2730.4s] unto him in a dream. And I will speak
[2733.0s] unto him in what? A dream." So it means
[2735.4s] that because we read on the other
[2739.2s] day 13 and by a prophet the children of
[2743.6s] Israel were led from Egypt to the
[2745.8s] promised land and also by a prophet they
[2748.6s] were preserved. It also means that for
[2752.0s] sevenist for them to come from midnight
[2754.7s] cry to the heaven to heaven it means
[2757.4s] that they must possibly
[2761.1s] labage. Praise God. Because God knew
[2765.4s] that children cannot pass the middle of4
[2768.6s] without them having a
[2771.6s] problem without them having the problem.
[2775.1s] But you have
[2783.0s] only4 but the children of the children
[2786.6s] of Israel could not have come out of
[2788.6s] Babylon without Egypt without prophet.
[2791.4s] It mean that
[2792.7s] also cannot pass down a prophet. So they
[2797.7s] come and now God is calling a
[2800.3s] prophet and that first prophet who the
[2805.5s] prophet of this was called
[2808.1s] William. You write that king. The first
[2811.4s] one who called and gave a mission is
[2813.8s] someone who is called
[2820.4s] William
[2822.8s] Among the 485.
[2830.0s] to
[2842.5s] 485 a prophet among
[2845.6s] you. There's someone who is called
[2848.9s] William the first
[2852.4s] called number one.

[2878.8s] given to vision in Boston in 1842. He
[2882.6s] was given vision in the year 1842.
[2886.0s] It means that before the before is

[2890.9s] had to give them what a prophet. Praise
[2893.3s] God. Amen. He was given a vision in the
[2895.3s] year 1844 passing what?

[2910.6s] revelation for he viewed the glorious
[2912.6s] reward of the faithful. He will review
[2915.0s] the glorious reward of the painful and
[2917.2s] the uh punishment of sinners. He will
[2919.9s] review also the punishment of the
[2921.5s] sinners. Not being instructed not being
[2924.1s] instructed to relate to others what was
[2926.6s] shown him to relate to others what was
[2929.4s] shown him. He told no one of his vision.
[2931.9s] He told no one of that vision. But he
[2934.0s] had no peace of mind. He had no peace of
[2936.7s] mind. In the second revelation, in the
[2938.9s] second revelation, he witnessed the
[2940.7s] multitudes on earth array before
[2943.2s] heaven's bar of judgment, a mighty angel
[2946.5s] with the silver trumpet. Yes. Uh in hand
[2949.7s] about to descend uh to earth by three
[2952.4s] steps. Yes. The books of record in
[2955.1s] heaven. Mhm. The coming of Christ. Yes.
[2958.2s] And the reward of the faithful. Yes. He
[2960.6s] was bidded. He was bidded. Thou must
[2962.9s] reveal those things which thou hast
[2965.3s] seen. Thou must reveal those things
[2967.7s] which thou hast seen and also what thy
[2970.3s] fellow creatures and also thy fellow
[2973.2s] creatures to flee from the wrath to God.
[2976.2s] to flee from the wrath of
[2978.2s] God. Praise God. Amen. He was the first
[2981.0s] man who was given what? Given vision. He
[2985.4s] was the first man who was given vision.
[2987.8s] Can you continue? I want to take a
[2989.7s] point. Two days after this revelation. 2
[2992.4s] days after this revelation, he was
[2994.4s] requested by the pastor of the uh Bloom
[2997.7s] Bloomfield Street Church in Boston to
[3000.4s] release this vision. Yes. Although he
[3002.8s] was a fluent speaker, Yes. he
[3005.4s] reluctantly complied. He reluctantly
[3007.8s] complied fearing that the general
[3010.1s] prejudice
[3011.6s] against vision. Yes. And the fact that
[3013.9s] he was
[3016.7s] Yes. will make his work difficult.
[3021.3s] You can read what happened. But God did
[3024.7s] not use what? God did
[3029.2s] not heal.
[3035.0s] But not saying that God has made another
[3038.0s] person who call has a
