FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Morning. Thank you for the first lesson. I pray that may also guide me how thou has guide thy son. We pray that let thy name be lifted in all things. I plead in Jesus name. [Music] God is good and all the time. Uh we thank God so much for this wonderful morning he has given us. Thank you. We thank God for this morning he has given us that we may study his word together. And I also thank the teacher that have just passed and for the lesson of through education that have just passed and how God blessed him. And that's why I've chosen to songs uh to sing song number 523 that we need no any other evidence. We need no any other plea. It is enough that Jesus has died for us. Also mean in this my lesson I want to try to explain that by the end of it we may think that we need no other evidence. We need no any other play. It is enough that Jesus had died for us. Praise God. On the last lesson, where did we look on the last lesson? Yes. On the last lesson, we were looking for the bath of remnant church and we also tried to look about the pioneers history and the stories about the pioneers. And without wasting a lot of time when we were giving the the course outline that we will come to discover when I was looking for the lesson which I'm remaining with I try to uh I look and I become perplexed that I only have only one lesson before me and two the last topic which I gave the alpha and the apostasy will take much of my time and I've not looked it. So you just bear with me. I will try to go fast because I know seventh adventist are wise men and women you have brain. So even if I I'm going to go fast you you will just bear with me because time uh today we want to look on this topic of church heritage. You want to look on the subtopic which is called organization development and fall. Please organization development and organization development and form. So when we're looking for the history of the seventh adventist church, when we're looking on the division among the seventh adventist church, we determine that from the year 1844 the passing of time in the October 22nd many people were discouraged and the milite movement was divided into split of groups into atoms of organization. The first we find that there was an organization called the spiritualist. The second we look for the first day Adventist. The third we look also for the evangelical Adventist. And the fourth one will look for the sabotarian Adventist. The Adventists who are obeying the Sabbath day and also doing what? Waging for the second advent of Christ. And we come and realize also that after the passing of time man God is using a man called him and he's giving the vision of what has happened in the year on October 22nd 1844 and when they come together with pioneers like James White Joseph Bates and Ellen White they try to investigate what happened in the year 1844 and there we are finding the birth of the remnant So I want to jump very quickly up to the year 1860 up to the year60 on organization development and the form. Praise God. You can write organization development and the form. When we read the year 1860, there's something remarkable that happened that in the year 1860, 7th Adventist was given the name Seventh Adventist given to Sabatarian Adventist. You know, you know the history of the seventh adventist church or the Sabarian reaching the year 1816, they were given the name 7th day Adventist. When you read the book of one 4 to4 paragraph number one is saying that having voted to adopt a name the discussion now turned on what that name should be the name church of God was proposed and zealously advocated by some praise God is the name church of god wrong is it a sweet name the seabarian was saying hey we can call oursel what church of god it was objected that the name was already used by some denomination and on this account was indefinite beside having to the world an appearance of presumptions. Do we have churches called the church of God? Voice of salvation and healing church of God. What what what church of God? What what church of God? We have a lot of people called the church of God. But how many people see Adventist and the other one we share the name Seventh Day Adventist. We want to look why. Then I continue the name seventh adventist was proposed as a simple name and an expressive of our faith and position. Then the resolution come that we take the name Seventh Adventist. So in the year 1860, Sabatarian Adventist change their name to be seventh day adventist and seventh adventist have a meaning because when we read the book of 1 Samuel is 25:25 it is it is number as his name it means that our name is our character. Let me proceed. This resolution was discussed freely and the wording was adjusted to that we call ourselves seventh adventist. It was finally acted upon even though TJ Battle and Elder Lawrence Spar Andrews and Iraham refrained from voting. People did not agree with that name. But Ellen White was given a vision that this is the name that you ought to call yourself. It means that when we are in this place we are seventh day Adventist. Praise God. What is our name? We call ourselves seventh adventist. Why? Because this name is the name the Lord has given us. Let proceed. One of four paragraph number one. You're right. It say why do we take the name Seventh Day Adventist? A question worth to be considered. Why do we take the name Seven Seventh Day Adventist? Why did we not take disciples? And it is a good name. Why did we not take Christians? Why do we call did we not call ourselves the church of God? It is a question that people are asking themselves. The question, who are these people known as Seventh Day Adventist? Who are you? And what is the work they are trying to do are being asked more and more among the people of our land as our cause is coming more prominently before them. Why do we take the name Seventh Adventist? People are inquiring that why do we take the name Seventh Day Adventist Church? You can write it's the book called SD AWK 7th Day Adventist and their work. SD AWK written by Smith. It's saying this is our answer that we should give to the world. This name is assumed by us for only two reason. The number one reason is to distinguish us from other organized Christian bodies and another is to show the nature of our work. That is the first reason why we take the name seventh adventist. It means that God has made us to be a peculiar people. We are to be distinguished from the world to call ourselves disciples, Christians, church of God or or by many other names that might be mentioned. I know you can call yourself the remnant. You can call yourselves young evangelist. No, but our name is Seventh Day Adventist Church. You can call yourself what the last testimony, what anything. But we know that our name is Seventh Adventist Church or by any other name that might be mentioned will be of no account because such a name will not distinguish us from others who have the same name. Reason number two why we have adopted the name Seth Adventist is that the name we have taken indicates that we have enlisted in a work which we understand from scriptures. Do you understand your work? It means that before calling yourself sevenist you have to determine and understand the work that the Lord has called you. The name was have been taken to indicate that we have been elixed in a work which we understand from the scriptures is to be done in the present generation having for it chief's characteristic the keeping of the same there as the Sabbath and a belief in and promalgation of the doctrine of the second uh second person coming of Jesus Christ as now at the dawn. Praise God. We are in a work that we understand. Secondly, it is that we keep the seventh day seventh day Sabbath and we call people that Christ is the soon and immen and Christ is ready. Christ is coming in a short while. That is why we take the name Sim Baptist and I want to show you that we are not ashamed of our name. Let you not be ashamed of our of your name. to SMP 384 paragraph number one. Let me tell you it say that we are seventh adventist. Are we ashamed of our name? Are we ashamed of our name? We answer no. No, we are not ashamed. It is the name the Lord has given us. It points out the the truth that is to be the test of the churches. Even before us presenting the truth of the three angels messages y our name is distinguishing us and it is showing our work. We are seventh adventist and of this name we are never to be ashamed. As a people we must take a firm stand for the truth and righteousness. Thus we shall glorify God. We are to be delivered from dangers, not ens snared and corrupted by them. That this may be, we must look ever to Jesus the author and finish our faith. That is 2384. The paragraph is number two. We are not to be ashamed of our name because this name is the name the Lord has given us. In one B we have read that God is the one who given us this name. We are never to be ashamed of our name. We are never to be ashamed of our name. That is the year 1860. We given the name seventh adventist. That is the organization development. The seventh adventist is developing. Having adopted the name in the year 1816. Now they come in the year 1861 that they may unite themselves and fast in it is the year 1860 that now the Mexican conference is being organized. The Michigan conference is being organized in the year 1860. After adopting the name they say it was resolved that we recommend to the churches in the state of Michigan to unite in one conference with the name of the Michigan Conference of 7th day adventist. Are you understanding me? It mean that before the organization of the general conference first they must organize also the state conference. Do you know what a state conference is? It is like so region conference conference before them organizing themsel as a name seventh adventist general conference of seventh adventist state conference first organized themselves and after the organization of the state conference they send their delegates and go and organize their body as general conference. Not all church are carried by bus to go and organize themsel as a general conference. No, they send their delegates and they go and organize in one body of general conference. So when Michigan conference was organized, you're finding that the resolution was quickly adopted. Then the ministers and delegates from the churches were declared members of Michigan conference. Appropriate officers and conference committee were elected. So in the year 1861 when Michigan conference was organized, the chairman was Joseph base and the club was similar of the current year that is in the year 184042. So Joseph Bates and Smith they were elected as the member or as the organizers executive committee of the Michigan conference. Let me run quickly now. They come in the year 1863 and they say that state conference can organize but we are still confused. There are another conferences in different places. So what should we do for them to attain an perfect organization? They must go now to organize as a general body. Now they come in the year 1863. In the year is May 1863, the organization of General Conference of 7th Day Adventist. In the year 1863, it say for the purpose of securing unity and efficiency in labor, the promoting that is in the book of 480. It is 480. For the purpose of securing unity and efficiency in labor, the promoting of general entrance of the cause of present truth, and of perfecting the organization of 7th Day Adventist, we the delegates from several state conferences hereby proceed to organize a general conference. Praise God. So what are being sent to organize a general conference? delegates from state conference or delegates from regional conference. Now they for them to secure perfect unity they must also be in a general body. There were nine articles in the constitution specifying the name general conference of 7th day adventist. Three offices were called. Number one, the first office which was called is president. Number two, we have the secretary and number three we have the treasurer. Those are the exh those are the those are the offices which were elected and beside that there were also an executive committee of three. Are you getting me? The executive committee of three as organization was developing the executive committee developed from three to five to 9 to 13 to 17 and to 25. It continue an election of officers and executive committee was the next business. So the nominating committee went and elect and they bring their report for the ratification that it may be ratified. So this was their report. The committee of uh of nomination reported as follow. The president with the nomination committee elected was James White. The secretary was SA Smith and the treasurer was ES Wala and we have also the executive committee of what of three. When first organization was being chosed, the executive committee could consist of three people and and one of them being who the pre president. So it was this was the the what the report that they brought on motion the conference proceed to vote on nomination presented. Brother Wy was anominously chosen president but declined to serve. Why? Why did brother White decline to serve? Who can explain in five sentence? H five words. Yes, brother Felix. Thank you. Because you are being told that brother White was the one pressing what organization then he was anonymously elected and to remove the idea that he was not what fighting over over job. He say that let me alone first. After after considerable time spent in discussion they discuss that brother why don't you take this what this seat we see no one can take it the brethren urging reason why you should accept the position they have the reason and solid reason and and why he should not also brother white stood and say that I should not I don't want this position because this and this this resignation was finally accepted and Elder John Bington elected as president in his state. So it is now uh so it so the president was John Bington the secretary Rasmid and the treasurer who escal the nomination for secretary and treasurer was then ratified JN Andrews and GW Amadon were chosen as the remaining members of the executive [Music] committee. So you can write that the first president of the general conference would John Bington. Let us general conference presidents of 7th day Adventist. Number one we have John Bington. He worked from the May 1863 to May 1865. The the conference moved into its work in organizing the general conference of 7th day Adventist as noted elsewhere that I'm in the book of one bio 479 for to 481 the general conference move into the work in organizing the general conference of 7th year adventies as noted elsewhere the conference elected John Bington as president Smith as secretary es wala treasurer Uh James White was firstly uh first unanimously elected to the presidency but he thought it is best to let another carry that responsibility. Bington will be joined by JN Anderson and GW Amadon making the executive committee of three. So the first president of 7th Adventist working from the year 1863 to 1865 is who? John Bington. Coming to the general conference or annual session of 1865, we are finding the second president who is now James White. James White, the second president now of 7th Day Adventist. He worked from the year May 1865 to May 1867. The committee of nomination brought in in a report recommending officers for the coming year for President James White, secretary Uriah Smith, treasurer ID van Horn. They were elected and a general conference committee was named made up of James White, JN Andrews and John Non lo. Are you writing this? That is in the year 1865. They also come again in the year 1865 annual meeting and James White was again reelected. It is the same post they reelected samely. They worked samely. The nomination committee recommended officers for the general conference for presidents James White, secretary Smith, treasurer I van Horn plus an executive committee an executive committee of white and lo that is two bio 116.6 and 21136 number one. So James White coming the second president of the 7th day Adventist church. The third one we are finding the third president is Jon Nevin Andrews working from the May 1867 to May 18 69. You can read on two bio 173 paragraph number one that John Nevin Andrew was elected president of general conference Smith secretary and ID van horn treasurer John Neio 271.6 She said that John Nevis Andrew who had served for two years as president of general conference of 7th day Adventist that is the third president. The fourth president it is James White again but the fourth president is James White. This is now the second term James White second term. The fourth President James White who worked from May 186169 to December 1871. AT69 general conference session says that the nominating committee was brought into the following recommendation for the offices offices and general conference committee for a president was elected James White secretary Ras Smith and treasurer ES Wala and executive committee of James White John Nevis Andrew and J Wagon coming the fourth president of seventh adventist we are finding a man called George Butler elected from May December 1871 to August 1874. That is number five. Number five. Then comes number six again. Who is elected once more? The sixth one. I'm in the fifth or the sixth. The sixth. Now come who? Once again. So this is now the last time James White is finishing his work and now he's dying in the year 1881. James White worked from August 1872 to October 1880. How many years? 6 years. But when we combine the years that James White have worked being told of James White was the president of general conference session in in 10 years. When you combine those years, how many years are they? 10. In how many terms? theta terms. So you can write from the year 1865 to 1867. You also work 1869 to 1871. You also work 1874 to 1818. You can write that read that on Adventist pioneer biography and pictures page number 24 and the paragraph is paragraph number three. after start working then George Butler Texas once again in October 1880 up to October 1888 8 years elderlas now it is the the second term of elabler is working in a combination of 11 years in 11 what years that is now Elder Batler. George Butler. Have you wrote? Have you right? Yes. We have You are going to another one. Another president of the Seventh Adventist whom you can know is Olen A. Olen working from October October 1888. It is just an October 1888 to February 18 97. Love comes another another president who is called George I George Owen working from February 1897 to April 1901. From now April 1901 to May 1922 we are finding also someone who is called Arthur G Daniel ag Daniels. Then there are another one. Then I run to my friend Nelie Wilson. Do you know Nelie Wilson? The father of four. Thank you. The father of Ted Wilson. So those are the uh general conference presidents that we can note in the development of the seventh day adventist. You cannot you can go and do your your research on your research on betweenness the presidents that you can find but them that can be noted as the pioneers of Adventist we are finding is the ones that have tried to I have tried to note I should go to another slide [Music] He served for a lot of years, not all the years, but there's a time that I he was keen on writing what on writing letters and writing reports and bookkeeping. He he really sufferable. It is more than now 20 years. It is more than even 30 years. He really served and you when you go and read about the history of Rasm we are finding he was also good in writing editing and he was also because he was also what he could not be the president of the general conference because he was on the leg what leg feet. Yes, I that's why he could not serve as the general conference president because he lo what his land. So he could not move from this place to this place. That's why he was faithful in his work but he only serve as the secretary. So we now go because we looked that in the year 1860 we were given a name and for us to be given a name also we have to be given a sign to point that our name to also the demonstrate the nature of our work. What is the t [Music] Yes. The nature of our work. So we are going for our sign of the seventh adventist. you will allow me to go like this because I only want have one lesson before me but you can go and do your research. So the question what to be considered is what is our sign or our banner? We should be known by two things the nature of our work our character and the work we have been instructed to do which it is being pointed by our name. The also message that we bear as seventh day adventist. It is being pointed by our sign. So Psalm 60 verse number four here the words of the lord is saying that thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth that God has instructed to this church a banner. And when this banner is being displayed, it is being be displayed because of the truth. The Lord has given us. Psalms 20 verse number four verse number 5. We say that we will rejoice in the name of the uh we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our God we will set us set up our banner. The Lord fulfill all thy petition. It means that because of the truth that we bear in the name of our of the Lord our God, we will come and set up our banner. So now comes that God give us a banner into 384 paragraph number three that the banner of the third angels has incribed upon the commandment of God and the faith of Jesus. Our institution have taken a name which set forth the character of our faith and of this name we are never to be ashamed. Praise God. I have been shown that this name means much and in adopting it we follow the light given us from heaven. It means that God has given us the banner of the three angels. What messages that is our banner that we were given by God. In the name of our Lord, we will set up our banner. Let's go. So question and question now you should consider and asked yourself when you look for the seventh adventures calling themselves general conference which has president which was established in the foundation. Question you should consider what happened to this logo then why this? What happened to this logo? Then why this? Let this question linger in your mind that what happened to this logo? Then why this? When we are looking on the history of the seventh day Adventist, we we come to realize that the history of the ancient Israel is a striking illustration of the past experience of the advent body. God led his people in the advent body even as he led the children of Israel from Egypt. It means that when there was a change in seventh adventist, it means that also Israel must have been this change. And for us to establish that that seventh adventist which called themselves so they are not the church of God. We also have to go and look for the earlier seventh adventist in the biblical context. Praise God. So there's something I really love in Deuteronomy 31 verse number 26 that now open your Bible. Deuteronomy 31 verse number 24 25 and 26 it says and it came to pass when Moses had made the end of the writing the words of this law in the book until they were finished that Moses commanded the le which bear the ark of the covenant said take this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God that it may be there for a witness against thee. So we are finding that when Moses had made the end of the writing and if you could have time I know you can go and investigate for yourself. We find we try in GC we come and realize that the history of the ancient Israel is also the history of the seventh seventh day adventist. It mean that if the ancient Israelites had a prophet also the seventh adventist must have a pro a prophets. That's why Isaiah 12:3 he said that by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt and by a prophet they were preserved. Also it means that by a prophet we were brought out of the world and also by a prophet we are going to be preserved and who is the prophet that has been extracted to this church. That's why also Israelites given the law of Moses and also given the commandment of God. Also this church is being given the law of God which is the scriptures and the spirit of prophecy. Linda messages 33 paragraph 4 is saying that the law of God and the spirit of prophecy go hand in hand to guide and cancel the church. And whenever the church has recognized this by obeying his law, the spirit of prophecy has been sent to guide her in the way of the truth. So the law of God, biblical Bible and the spirit of prophecy, they go hand in hand in guiding the church of God. So the question, what happened? What happened? The question is what happened to this logo and then why this? After the passing of bion the last pioneers in the year 1922 John not lo there comes now things started to change in seventh adventics that's why judges 2 verse number 10 say the question you can see on the screen that from the b of the three angels messages of the seventh adventist to the the three wavy lines and the cross in its m east. what happened the thing that have happened to us that's why this church have taken his time to explain the two education messages because of judges 2 verse number 10 that happened in the ancient Israelites saying and also all that generation the pioneers the last one dying in the year 19:22 all this generation gathered unto their fathers and there arose another gen another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. After the pioneers passed, there arose another another what another body. There was another people which knew not God. All the things that he had done yet done. They knew not God. It means that now the trinity god must do what? The trinity god must happen. So now see the prediction of apostasy in that judges 31 verse number 26 to 29. You see the parallel of Moses and Ellen White when they are predicted what is going to happen in seventh adventism. Look and read with me kingly. See this predicted apostasy. Last warning of Moses before death. These are the last warning that Moses is giving to the church before death that take this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark of covenant of the Lord your God that it may be for a witness against thee. For I know thy rebellion and thy stiffness. Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the Lord. And how much more after my death? Moses is saying that when I am with you now, you are following, you are going into apostasy. Then how after my death? Gather unto me all the elders of your tribe and your officers that I may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to records against them. Moses is making his last work. So consider chapter verse number 29. For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourself and know and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you and evil will befall you in the latter days because you will do evil in the sight of God to provoke him to anger through the work of your hand that after my death you will go into what? Apostasy. This is the prediction of who that take the Bible and the spirit of prophecy. They have to go hand in hand. I know that after my death rebellion will come. When I am still yet alive with thee, you have brought the what? The apostasy. What that thing happened in the seventh adventist before the death of Ellen White? There comes apostasy. Let me proceed. Now you write this book. 25 LTMS manuscript one of 1915 paragraph 2 start with paragraph 2 that see this predicted apostasy last warning of Moses before death also see this Ellen White last warning before death as was this this predicted apostasy M 25 MTMS manuscript one of 1950 15 paragraph 2 is saying that I tell you now that I when I am laid to rest great changes will take this the words of Moses for I know 27 for I know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck because behold while I am yet alive with you this day you have been rebellious against God and how much more after my death Now Ellen White is writing that I tell you now. This in the year 195. I tell you now that when I am laid to rest great changes will take place. I do not know when I shall be taken and I desire to warn you all against the devices of devil. I want the people to know that I warned them fully before my death. I warned you fully before my death. The is saying that I warn you fully before my death. I do not know especially what changes will take place but they should watch every conceivable sin that Satan will try to immortalize. I do not know when I will be late to rest but when I'm late to rest great changes will take place. That's why is writing in one page 204 paragraph number two. Write and read with me kindly line upon line. It say that the enemy of the soul has sought to bring in the supposition that a great reformation will take place among the seventh adventist. The enemy of the soul who is the devil. He has sought to bring suppososition that a great reformation was to take place among the seventh day Adventist and that this reformation will consist in giving up the doctrine we stand as the pillars of our faith and engaging in the process of reorganization. It mean that seventh adventist it reach a point that they must be reorganized. They must give their doctrines and they fulfill the prophecy. So question what this reformation to take place what will result? So you should write if reformation which was predicted by Moses and Ellen White will take place what will result? Number two number one what will result? The principle of truth that God in his wisdom has given to the remnant church will be discarded. That is number one. What this reformation to take place, what will result? Number one, the principle of truth that God is in his wisdom has given to the remnant church will be discarded. The medicine was medicine school sold. Did it enter apostasy? Was our publishing house sold? Was our sanitarium sold? Number two, our religion will be changed. Number three, the fundamental principles that have sustained the work for the last 50 years will be discarded as error. It means that our truth was going to be discarded as error. Number four, a new organization will be established. Which organization was established? General Conference of 7th Day Adventist Church. It means that they must establish another organization with different name with different banner with different teachings. Numbers of new order will be written. Those are the four things that happened. Five things. So now look, books of new orders was written. Number four book was which was written is living temple. I just noted because I don't know if Friday I will find time to speak about the alpha and omega of apostasy but you can go and investigate if I will not talk about the alpha and omega of apostasy that the book living temple which contain pantheism the teaching of the pantheism which is the strength the personality of the father and the son number two book which was written it question on doctrine that is now the the living temple is the alpha of apostasy and question of doctrine is the omega of the apostasy. Number four book which is the movement of destiny written by Leroy Fume and also the coming of the comforter written by Leroy F and defending the god which is written by Vance farm who have read the defending defending godhead. Have you seen that book? Those are the books of new god. You cannot s but books of new order will be written. Number two, we find that the fundamental principles that have sustained the work for the last 50 years will be discarded as error. How were they discarded? Can you look that timeline? In the year 1872, it was the declaration of the fundamental principle of 7th day Adventist. Reaching the year 1874, the 1872 fundamental principles were published. One was published by James White in science of times. You can go and look in the blue estate. It is there. The second one was was published by Smith in a publishing house called review and herald. Reaching the year 1889, fundamental principle was expanded to 28 without the trinity doctrine. Now come the year 1915. The old seventh adventist have been started to be changed. The doctrine has been started to be changed. Now they come out to the year 1931. Now the yearbooks here book the yearbook with new beliefs. Now it is published. Having the trinity doctrine at the second fundamental principle the third if reformation will take place what will result our religion will be changed and a new organization will be formed let me question what to be considered I'm asking you a question and prepare me answer me quickly how can I change the bu a Buddhist or Islam to be a Christian. How can I change a Buddhist or an Islam to be a Christian? Yes. I'm changing Buddha and I'm changing Allah and bringing to them to the knowledge of the one true God. How can I change old DA church to be Catholics? Changing one true God and bringing up who? The Trinity God. Is it simple like that? For me to change Buddha, Buddhist to be to be Christian, I change Buddha. For me to change Islam, now I change Allah and they come and worship the one true God. It means that our religion will be changed. Seventh Adventist was changed when they accepted what the Trinity doctrine. So now read the words of Nelie Wilson. The year 1981, LC Wilson, General Conference president, announced that the church has officially adopted the Trinity Doctrine, which is now number two in the church 28 fundamental beliefs. Not now they are not principle, but they are now beliefs. Pastor Nell Wilson while president of general conference of seventh adventist. He declares before the seventh adventist church that there is another universal and truly Catholic organization. The seventh day Adventist church. They are not now seventh adventist but they are another universal organization. Catholic church. Seventh 7th day Adventist. Our religion will be done what will be changed. It is also predicted in Bible that when they enter a new organization will be formed. Now there comes new 7th day Adventist. It is being predicted in the Psalm 74 verse number four. For them to change seventh adventist fooling. Psalm 74 verse number four. And I jump to verse number 8 9 10 and 11 is saying that thine enemy ro in thy midst. Who is the enemy? Satan. And white have predicted that the enemy of the soul sought to bring in supposition in the seventh adventist. So th enemies ro in the midst of their congregation. The enemy entered the seventh adventist. Then they set up their banners. They set up their sign. They verse number eight saying they said in their heart let us destroy them together. They have burnt up all the synagogues of the god in thy land. Then we as old seven elephantes now are crying that we see not our signs. There's no any other prophet among us. Elen wise has been stoned and killed among us any knoweth how long. And you will read Proverbs 28 28:19 or 29:18. Where there's no vision, people perish. Where the prophet, where there's no prophet, people are going to do what? To perish. So after the enemy have set up their sign, now comes in verse number 10. Oh God, how long shall the adversary approach? Shall the enemy blasphem thy name forever? Then we are being asked, God is withdrawing his hand. Why withdraw thou thy hand? Even thy right hand pluck it out of thy bosom. So it forces God to now withdraw his son from that 7day Catholic and God may raise up his church once more. The enemy entered the church. There come a communical movement in the church and see the commandment the command of God. The adversary has spread out his hand upon all thy pleasant things. For she had seen that the hidden entered into her sanctuary whom thou didest command that they should not enter into thy congregation. God commanded that the hidden seven advent should not do a chemical movement but the enemy try to do what? To get in. to get in. I don't just have a phone but in five of page 90 something that coming the 1860 what 1863 the executive committee 6 then three then what then 11 then 13 then 25 for to call theirselves gone. So see how our banner is being changed and how this religion is being formed on another religion. Then I just finish. Go with me. Ezekiel 8 verse number 14 to 16. He's saying then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord's house which was towards the north and behold there sat a woman weeping for tamuz. So it means that the church of God there come a point that they started to worship Damos. Consider verse 15 and 16. He's saying, "Then said he unto me, hast thou seen this, oh son of man, turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abomination than you are seeing now?" And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house. And behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, about five and 20 men with their backs towards the temple of the Lord, and their faces towards the east, and they worship the sons towards the east. So see what is being done in the church of God. They bring up taboos. Number one. Number two, they start worshiping the sun. The sun is worshiped in three ways. How can I put in English? When sun is arising, the midday and what? When sun is setting. So it is God the father, God the son and God the holy spirit. See we have three stages of sun and here is so they start worshiping the trinity god. When the sun is coming from this side on the middle, God the father, God the son and God the holy spirit. Beside worshiping the son, the trinity god, they also start to worship what? Tamuz. What does tamuz means in seventh day adventist? Go with me. HBS. HBS. HBS page 145.4. So you see cross Babylonian origin. He's saying that the same sign of the cross that Rome now worshiped was used in Babylonian mysteries. Read with me was applied by paganism to sign magic purposes was honored with the same honors. Then that which is now called the Christian cross was originally not Christian emblem at all but was the mystic tu of the chaldines and Egyptians. The true origin from the letter T the initial name of Tamuz. So where does the cross come from? The Chaldans and the Egyptians and the Babylonians. That's why the cross is letter T. Do you see that when it is to to really come apostate they must bring that cross into the church they must also worship the trinity god are you getting me that's why now when you term seventh advent now you find two people old seventh adventist and new 7th day adventist it is predicted by len white in 2 SMPP 385 paragraph number two he's saying that a company was presented before me under the name Seventh Day Adventist who were advising that the banner or sign which make us a distinct people should not be held. So strikingly they're saying that this banner really separate us from many denominations. Now they saying that the banner of the three angels we should not like that. Then they remove the banner when the adversary come in. Now the adversary set up is what? the banner, the banner of the devil. For they claim that it was not the best policy of securing sus institution. But this distinct banner is to be born through the world to the clause of probation. You read great controversy page 568 paragraph number two say that papies place crosses upon their judges upon their altars and upon their garments. also seventh adventist papers all Catholic seventh day Adventist place crosses upon their churches upon their altars and upon their sit that and the angel only they are wise seven is already wise people are placing using what unithood but they are placing using comp computers computer. But they are placing using what? Some are placing using the hoods. Everywhere seen the insignia of the cross. Everywhere it is outwardly honored and exalted by the teaching of Christ are buried beneath the mass of sens tradition, false interpretation and uh rigorous exaction. So, a question worth asking asking you as I finish. Do you look on the screen? A question worth asking. I'm asking you a question in the book of Psalms 11 verse number 13. I'm asking you a question. Psalms 11 verse number three. That if the foundation be destroyed, what can the Russians do? If the foundation had destroyed, what can the Russians do? Who can give me clear answer? If the foundation, if Steven has really been destroyed, what can the Russians do? Who can give me the answer? Felix. What can the Russians do? rebuilding the the answer is in the book of Isaiah 58:12. Question is, if the foundation be destroyed, what can the Russians do? Then he say, "And they that shall be shall uh they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places. Thou shall raise up the foundation of many generation, and thou shalt be called the repairers of the bridge, the restorers of the path to dwell in." Praise God. So our work is to go to the old west places and do what? And rebuild because the command now come that we should not come out of the old landmarks. That's why God is saying in the book of Jeremiah 6 verse number 16 that thus says the Lord stand in the way. When we are being published like this what should we do? We stand in the way and see and ask for the old 7th day Adventist church and ask that where is the old seventh adventist doctrine and walk therein and we are going to find rest in the second advent of Christ. Now God is calling now God is calling us to restore and be old 7th day Adventist. That's why we are calling ourselves old what? Rebuilding the old foundation. The commandment came in proverbs 22:28 that remove not the ancient landmarks which thy fathers have said that is the command that came because Deuteronomy 32:7 in that ask thy fathers and they will shield thee. Proverbs 32:28 that remove not the ancient landmarks we thy fathers have set. Remove not the old landmarks and enter not in the fields of the fathers. God is calling us to the three angels message of 7th Adventist church. We are being called to restore our banner to become all seventh day Adventist. But when we are come to rebuild the whole foundation I want you to mark this point. Mark this point. We not are coming here. We are not coming with the mind of the world. But mark this point. 1 Corinthians 3 11. For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid than that is laid which is Jesus Christ. We are not laying any other foundation. We are not we are not doing anything but we are being called to rebel. To rebel. No any other foundation can we lay. We can start. know any other church than that which was laid by who? By Jesus Christ. But when we have come to what to lay the first lesson was the foundation of our work. We go to Ephesians 2 verse number 20. We say that are built upon the foundation of the apostle and the prophets. Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. And of the first lesson when we are rebuilding we are going first to Jesus who is the Bible and the scriptures. We are going to build also from the pioneers who is Ellen White writings and also we are going to the apostles who are the pio pioneers. Praise God. We are being called mark this point that we are being called to build upon the old foundation. I should learn my lesson at that point because my time is much spent. In the next lesson I will try so much to I should handle something on the I've tried to handle but I will try to finish my lesson on Friday. Is there anyone with a question then I pray then I give you chance. Thank you. Can you can you pray then I give you chance? Our father and God in heaven, thank you so much for this wonderful morning. Thank you for the word that thou have shared with us. I really plead before the cross that before the close of probation, may you help us to restore the old foundation and go back to the old seventh adventist and walk in the true principles of thine way. I really pray may you help that children who are making decision to stand within the ways of righteousness that they may not remove the old landmarks. Above all may thy will be done. I plead in Jesus name.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.4s] Morning. Thank you for the first lesson.
[2.9s] I pray that may also guide me how thou
[5.9s] has guide thy son. We pray that let thy
[9.0s] name be lifted in all things. I plead in
[11.2s] Jesus name.
[16.4s] [Music]
[20.2s] God is good and all the
[24.0s] time. Uh we thank God so much for this
[26.8s] wonderful morning he has given us.
[36.4s] Thank you. We thank God for this morning
[38.3s] he has given us that we may study his
[40.1s] word together. And I also thank the
[42.9s] teacher that have just passed and for
[44.6s] the lesson of through education that
[46.6s] have just passed and how God blessed
[49.4s] him. And that's why I've chosen to songs
[52.1s] uh to sing song number
[54.4s] 523 that we need no any other evidence.
[57.4s] We need no any other plea. It is enough
[60.2s] that Jesus has died for us. Also mean in
[63.4s] this my lesson I want to try to explain
[66.2s] that by the end of it we may think that
[68.9s] we need no other evidence. We need no
[71.7s] any other play. It is enough that Jesus
[74.8s] had died for us. Praise
[77.9s] God. On the last lesson, where did we
[81.2s] look on the last
[84.4s] lesson?
[86.8s] Yes. On the last lesson, we were looking
[89.1s] for the bath of remnant church and we
[91.6s] also tried to look about the pioneers
[93.6s] history and the stories about the
[95.8s] pioneers. And without wasting a lot of
[98.0s] time when we were giving the the course
[100.3s] outline that we will come to discover
[103.0s] when I was looking for the lesson which
[105.0s] I'm remaining with I try to uh I look
[108.6s] and I become perplexed that I only have
[111.4s] only one lesson before me and two the
[115.3s] last topic which I gave the alpha and
[116.9s] the apostasy will take much of my time
[120.0s] and I've not looked it. So you just bear
[121.8s] with me. I will try to go fast because I
[125.4s] know seventh adventist are wise men and
[128.3s] women you have brain. So even if I I'm
[132.0s] going to go fast you you will just bear
[134.6s] with me because time uh today we want to
[138.0s] look on this topic of church heritage.
[140.5s] You want to look on the subtopic which
[142.2s] is called organization development and
[144.2s] fall. Please organization development
[147.8s] and
[152.9s] organization development and form. So
[157.0s] when we're looking for the history of
[158.3s] the seventh adventist church, when we're
[160.8s] looking on the division among the
[163.3s] seventh adventist church, we determine
[165.6s] that from the year
[167.5s] 1844 the passing of time in the October
[170.4s] 22nd many people were discouraged and
[173.4s] the milite movement was divided into
[176.9s] split of groups into atoms of
[180.0s] organization. The first we find that
[182.1s] there was an organization called the
[183.8s] spiritualist. The second we look for the
[186.3s] first day Adventist. The third we look
[189.0s] also for the evangelical Adventist. And
[191.7s] the fourth one will look for the
[193.0s] sabotarian Adventist. The Adventists who
[195.8s] are obeying the Sabbath day and also
[198.2s] doing what? Waging for the second advent
[201.3s] of Christ. And we come and realize also
[205.4s] that after the passing of time man God
[208.2s] is using a man called
[210.8s] him and he's giving the vision of what
[214.2s] has happened in the year on October 22nd
[217.5s] 1844 and when they come
[220.8s] together with pioneers like James White
[223.4s] Joseph Bates and Ellen White they try to
[226.5s] investigate what happened in the year
[228.4s] 1844 and there we are finding the birth
[230.8s] of the remnant
[232.6s] So I want to jump very quickly up to the
[235.5s] year 1860 up to the year60 on
[239.4s] organization development and the form.
[242.3s] Praise God. You can write organization
[244.8s] development and the form. When we read
[246.7s] the year 1860, there's something
[249.2s] remarkable that happened that in the
[251.4s] year 1860, 7th Adventist was given the
[255.5s] name Seventh Adventist given to
[258.1s] Sabatarian
[260.1s] Adventist. You know, you know the
[261.8s] history of the seventh adventist church
[263.5s] or the Sabarian reaching the year
[266.9s] 1816, they were given the name 7th day
[271.4s] Adventist. When you read the book of one
[274.6s] 4 to4 paragraph number one is saying
[276.4s] that having voted to adopt a name the
[279.7s] discussion now turned on what that name
[281.9s] should be the name church of God was
[284.8s] proposed and zealously advocated by some
[288.4s] praise God is the name church of god
[291.2s] wrong is it a sweet name the seabarian
[295.8s] was saying hey we can call oursel what
[298.6s] church of god it was objected that the
[301.8s] name was already used by some
[303.7s] denomination and on this account was
[306.9s] indefinite beside having to the world an
[309.4s] appearance of
[311.2s] presumptions. Do we have churches called
[313.2s] the church of God? Voice of salvation
[315.9s] and healing church of God. What what
[318.3s] what church of God? What what church of
[320.7s] God? We have a lot of people called the
[322.8s] church of God. But how many
[330.7s] people see Adventist and the other one
[334.5s] we share the name Seventh Day
[336.8s] Adventist. We want to look why. Then I
[340.1s] continue the name seventh adventist was
[342.2s] proposed as a simple name and an
[345.0s] expressive of our faith and position.
[347.4s] Then the resolution come that we take
[349.2s] the name Seventh Adventist. So in the
[351.8s] year
[353.1s] 1860, Sabatarian Adventist change their
[355.8s] name to be seventh day adventist and
[358.5s] seventh adventist have a meaning because
[361.1s] when we read the book of 1 Samuel is
[364.0s] 25:25 it is it is number
[368.2s] as his name it means that our name is
[372.4s] our character. Let me proceed. This
[375.8s] resolution was discussed freely and the
[379.0s] wording was adjusted to that we call
[382.6s] ourselves seventh adventist. It was
[385.3s] finally acted upon even though TJ
[390.7s] Battle and Elder
[393.0s] Lawrence Spar Andrews and Iraham
[396.8s] refrained from voting. People did not
[399.7s] agree with that name. But Ellen White
[402.3s] was given a vision that this is the name
[404.6s] that you ought to call yourself. It
[407.8s] means that when we are in this place we
[410.2s] are seventh day Adventist. Praise God.
[413.9s] What is our
[416.0s] name? We call ourselves seventh
[418.3s] adventist. Why? Because this name is the
[420.9s] name the Lord has given us. Let
[424.5s] proceed. One of four paragraph number
[427.8s] one. You're right. It say why do we take
[430.5s] the name Seventh Day Adventist? A
[432.3s] question worth to be considered. Why do
[436.2s] we take the name Seven Seventh Day
[438.1s] Adventist? Why did we not take
[440.2s] disciples? And it is a good name. Why
[442.4s] did we not take Christians? Why do we
[444.9s] call did we not call ourselves the
[446.8s] church of God? It is a question that
[449.2s] people are asking themselves. The
[451.5s] question, who are these people known as
[454.1s] Seventh Day Adventist? Who are you?
[461.0s] And what is the work they are trying to
[465.0s] do are being asked more and more among
[468.2s] the people of our land as our cause is
[471.0s] coming more prominently before them. Why
[474.9s] do we take the name Seventh
[477.5s] Adventist? People are inquiring that why
[479.8s] do we take the name Seventh Day
[480.9s] Adventist Church? You can write it's the
[483.2s] book called SD
[484.7s] AWK 7th Day Adventist and their work. SD
[488.4s] AWK written by Smith. It's saying this
[491.8s] is our answer that we should give to the
[493.5s] world. This name is assumed by us for
[496.6s] only two reason. The number one reason
[500.0s] is to distinguish us from other
[503.0s] organized Christian bodies and another
[506.2s] is to show the nature of our work. That
[509.9s] is the first reason why we take the name
[513.0s] seventh adventist. It means that God has
[515.8s] made us to be a peculiar people. We are
[519.4s] to be distinguished from the world to
[522.2s] call ourselves disciples, Christians,
[525.4s] church of God or or by many other names
[528.6s] that might be mentioned. I know you can
[530.8s] call yourself the remnant. You can call
[533.0s] yourselves young evangelist. No, but our
[535.8s] name is Seventh Day Adventist Church.
[539.4s] You can call yourself what the last
[541.6s] testimony, what anything. But we know
[544.5s] that our name is Seventh Adventist
[548.0s] Church or by any other name that might
[551.1s] be mentioned will be of no account
[554.0s] because such a name will not distinguish
[556.5s] us from others who have the same name.
[560.9s] Reason number two why we have adopted
[563.5s] the name Seth Adventist is that the name
[567.1s] we have taken indicates that we have
[570.0s] enlisted in a work which we understand
[573.7s] from scriptures. Do you understand your
[577.2s] work? It means that before calling
[579.4s] yourself sevenist you have to determine
[582.7s] and understand the work that the Lord
[584.6s] has called
[586.7s] you. The name was have been taken to
[589.4s] indicate that we have been elixed in a
[591.1s] work which we understand from the
[593.4s] scriptures is to be done in the present
[595.7s] generation having for it chief's
[598.0s] characteristic the keeping of the same
[600.3s] there as the Sabbath and a belief in and
[604.3s] promalgation of the doctrine of the
[606.7s] second uh second person coming of Jesus
[611.1s] Christ as now at the dawn. Praise God.
[616.5s] We are in a work that we understand.
[618.6s] Secondly, it is that we keep the seventh
[621.6s] day seventh day Sabbath and we call
[624.1s] people that Christ is the soon and immen
[626.3s] and Christ is ready. Christ is coming in
[628.9s] a short
[630.4s] while. That is why we take the name Sim
[633.5s] Baptist and I want to show you that we
[635.8s] are not ashamed of our
[637.4s] name. Let you not be ashamed of our of
[640.2s] your name.
[642.8s] to SMP 384 paragraph number
[646.2s] one. Let me tell you it say that we are
[649.2s] seventh
[650.5s] adventist. Are we ashamed of our name?
[654.0s] Are we ashamed of our name? We answer
[656.6s] no. No, we are not ashamed. It is the
[660.2s] name the Lord has given us. It points
[663.0s] out the the truth that is to be the test
[667.1s] of the churches. Even before us
[670.5s] presenting the truth of the three angels
[675.7s] messages y our name is distinguishing us
[679.4s] and it is showing our work. We are
[683.8s] seventh adventist and of this name we
[686.7s] are never to be ashamed. As a people we
[690.8s] must take a firm stand for the truth and
[693.1s] righteousness. Thus we shall glorify
[695.3s] God. We are to be delivered from
[697.5s] dangers, not ens snared and corrupted by
[700.1s] them. That this may be, we must look
[703.3s] ever to Jesus the author and finish our
[706.4s] faith. That is
[708.4s] 2384. The paragraph is number two. We
[711.8s] are not to be ashamed of our name
[713.8s] because this name is the name the Lord
[715.8s] has given us. In one B we have read that
[719.1s] God is the one who given us this name.
[723.4s] We are never to be ashamed of our name.
[727.7s] We are never to be ashamed of our name.
[729.8s] That is the year
[731.4s] 1860. We given the name seventh
[733.8s] adventist. That is the organization
[736.2s] development. The seventh adventist is
[739.4s] developing. Having adopted the name in
[741.8s] the year 1816. Now they come in the year
[746.2s] 1861 that they may unite
[749.1s] themselves and fast in it is the year
[752.6s] 1860 that now the Mexican conference is
[755.3s] being
[757.6s] organized. The Michigan conference is
[759.9s] being organized in the year
[762.4s] 1860. After adopting the name they say
[765.0s] it was resolved that we recommend to the
[766.9s] churches in the state of Michigan to
[769.2s] unite in one conference with the name of
[771.1s] the Michigan Conference of 7th day
[775.1s] adventist. Are you understanding me? It
[778.2s] mean that before the organization of the
[780.1s] general conference first they must
[782.3s] organize also the state conference. Do
[785.0s] you know what a state conference is? It
[788.1s] is like so region
[791.3s] conference conference before them
[794.0s] organizing themsel as a name seventh
[796.6s] adventist general conference of seventh
[798.5s] adventist state conference first
[800.5s] organized themselves and after the
[802.6s] organization of the state conference
[804.9s] they send their delegates and go and
[807.8s] organize their body as general
[811.1s] conference. Not all church are carried
[813.4s] by bus to go and organize themsel as a
[815.8s] general conference. No, they send their
[818.8s] delegates and they go and organize in
[821.4s] one body of general
[823.0s] conference. So when Michigan conference
[825.2s] was organized, you're finding that the
[827.2s] resolution was quickly adopted. Then the
[830.0s] ministers and delegates from the
[831.7s] churches were declared members of
[833.4s] Michigan conference. Appropriate
[836.4s] officers and conference committee were
[839.2s] elected. So in the year 1861 when
[841.8s] Michigan conference was organized, the
[844.1s] chairman was Joseph
[846.4s] base and the club
[848.9s] was
[852.8s] similar of the current year that is in
[856.2s] the year
[858.8s] 184042. So Joseph Bates and Smith they
[863.2s] were elected as the member or as the
[866.8s] organizers executive committee of the
[870.0s] Michigan conference. Let me run quickly
[873.0s] now. They come in the year
[874.6s] 1863 and they say that state conference
[878.2s] can organize but we are still confused.
[882.2s] There are another conferences in
[884.3s] different places. So what should we do
[887.6s] for them to attain an perfect
[890.8s] organization? They must go now to
[892.8s] organize as a general body. Now they
[896.3s] come in the year 1863.
[898.8s] In the year is May
[901.0s] 1863, the organization of General
[903.8s] Conference of 7th Day Adventist. In the
[907.2s] year
[909.3s] 1863, it say for the purpose of securing
[913.2s] unity and efficiency in labor, the
[915.9s] promoting that is in the book of
[918.5s] 480. It is
[920.7s] 480. For the purpose of securing unity
[923.9s] and efficiency in labor, the promoting
[926.6s] of general entrance of the cause of
[929.4s] present truth, and of perfecting the
[931.8s] organization of 7th Day Adventist, we
[935.0s] the delegates from several state
[937.6s] conferences hereby proceed to organize a
[942.5s] general conference. Praise God. So what
[945.8s] are being sent to organize a general
[947.4s] conference?
[949.8s] delegates from state conference or
[952.8s] delegates from regional conference. Now
[956.1s] they for them to
[958.5s] secure perfect unity they must also be
[963.2s] in a general
[964.8s] body. There were nine articles in the
[967.7s] constitution specifying the name general
[970.4s] conference of 7th day adventist. Three
[973.4s] offices were called. Number one, the
[975.6s] first office which was called is
[979.0s] president. Number two, we have the
[981.0s] secretary and number three we have the
[983.8s] treasurer. Those are the exh those are
[986.9s] the those are the offices which were
[990.0s] elected and beside that there were also
[993.5s] an executive committee of
[998.0s] three. Are you getting me? The executive
[1001.5s] committee of three as organization was
[1005.1s] developing the executive committee
[1007.2s] developed from three to five to 9 to 13
[1011.1s] to 17 and to
[1013.3s] 25. It continue an election of officers
[1016.9s] and executive committee was the next
[1019.6s] business. So the nominating committee
[1021.8s] went and elect and they bring their
[1025.0s] report for the ratification that it may
[1027.8s] be ratified. So this was their report.
[1030.8s] The committee of uh of nomination
[1033.7s] reported as follow. The president with
[1036.1s] the nomination committee elected was
[1037.7s] James White. The secretary was SA Smith
[1042.0s] and the treasurer was ES Wala and we
[1046.2s] have also the executive committee of
[1047.8s] what of three. When first organization
[1051.3s] was being chosed, the executive
[1053.5s] committee could consist of three people
[1055.2s] and and one of them being who the pre
[1060.8s] president. So it was this was the the
[1063.8s] what the report that they
[1065.6s] brought on motion the conference proceed
[1068.5s] to vote on nomination presented. Brother
[1072.0s] Wy was anominously chosen president but
[1075.4s] declined to serve. Why? Why did brother
[1080.4s] White decline to serve? Who can explain
[1083.4s] in five sentence? H five
[1086.9s] words. Yes, brother Felix.
[1095.9s] Thank you. Because you are being told
[1097.4s] that brother White was the one pressing
[1099.7s] what
[1100.4s] organization then he was anonymously
[1102.9s] elected and to remove the idea that he
[1106.1s] was not what fighting
[1108.0s] over over job. He say that let me alone
[1112.7s] first. After after considerable time
[1116.2s] spent in discussion they discuss that
[1118.5s] brother why don't you take this what
[1120.2s] this seat we see no one can take
[1123.4s] it the brethren urging reason why you
[1126.2s] should accept the position they have the
[1128.7s] reason and solid
[1131.1s] reason and and why he should not also
[1134.8s] brother white stood and say that I
[1136.5s] should not I don't want this position
[1138.8s] because this and this this resignation
[1141.2s] was finally accepted and Elder John
[1143.9s] Bington elected as president in his
[1146.7s] state.
[1148.9s] So it is now uh so it so the president
[1152.8s] was John Bington the secretary Rasmid
[1157.0s] and the treasurer who
[1159.3s] escal the nomination for secretary and
[1162.8s] treasurer was then ratified JN Andrews
[1165.9s] and GW Amadon were chosen as the
[1169.2s] remaining members of the executive
[1172.0s] [Music]
[1173.3s] committee. So you can write that the
[1175.5s] first president of the general
[1177.0s] conference would John Bington. Let us
[1181.4s] general conference presidents of 7th day
[1185.2s] Adventist. Number one we have John
[1188.6s] Bington. He worked from the May
[1192.4s] 1863 to May 1865.
[1197.4s] The the conference moved into its work
[1200.1s] in organizing the general conference of
[1202.2s] 7th day
[1203.3s] Adventist as noted elsewhere that I'm in
[1206.3s] the book of one bio
[1208.9s] 479 for to
[1211.5s] 481 the general conference move into the
[1214.2s] work in organizing the general
[1215.7s] conference of 7th year adventies as
[1217.4s] noted
[1218.3s] elsewhere the conference elected John
[1220.8s] Bington as president Smith as secretary
[1224.6s] es wala treasurer Uh James White was
[1227.4s] firstly uh first unanimously elected to
[1231.8s] the presidency but he thought it is best
[1234.6s] to let another carry that
[1236.4s] responsibility. Bington will be joined
[1238.8s] by JN Anderson and GW Amadon making the
[1242.2s] executive committee of three. So the
[1245.5s] first president of 7th Adventist working
[1247.6s] from the year 1863 to 1865 is who? John
[1254.3s] Bington. Coming to the general
[1256.4s] conference or annual session of 1865, we
[1259.0s] are finding the second president who is
[1261.9s] now James
[1263.9s] White. James White, the second president
[1267.5s] now of 7th Day
[1269.7s] Adventist. He worked from the year May
[1273.3s] 1865 to May 1867.
[1277.8s] The committee of nomination brought in
[1280.4s] in a report recommending officers for
[1283.4s] the coming year for President James
[1286.1s] White, secretary Uriah Smith, treasurer
[1289.8s] ID van Horn. They were elected and a
[1294.8s] general conference committee was named
[1297.4s] made up of James White, JN Andrews and
[1300.0s] John Non
[1302.7s] lo. Are you writing
[1307.4s] this? That is in the year 1865. They
[1310.2s] also come again in the year 1865 annual
[1312.4s] meeting and James White was again
[1315.7s] reelected. It is the same post they
[1317.9s] reelected samely. They worked samely.
[1320.6s] The nomination committee recommended
[1322.2s] officers for the general conference for
[1323.8s] presidents James White, secretary Smith,
[1327.2s] treasurer I van Horn plus an executive
[1330.5s] committee an executive committee of

[1343.1s] the second president of the 7th day
[1345.5s] Adventist church.
[1348.2s] The third one we are finding the third
[1349.8s] president is Jon Nevin
[1352.6s] Andrews working from the May 1867 to May
[1357.0s] 18 69.
[1359.8s] You can read on two bio 173 paragraph
[1362.7s] number one that John Nevin Andrew was
[1365.7s] elected president of general conference
[1368.7s] Smith secretary and ID van horn

[1380.2s] John Nevis Andrew who had served for two
[1383.2s] years as president of general
[1385.8s] conference of 7th day
[1388.8s] Adventist that is the third president.
[1391.7s] The fourth president it is James White
[1396.1s] again but the fourth president is James
[1400.0s] White. This is now the second term James
[1402.9s] White second term. The fourth President
[1405.6s] James White who worked from May
[1408.9s] 186169 to December 1871.

[1426.0s] secretary Ras Smith and treasurer ES
[1429.0s] Wala and executive committee of James
[1431.5s] White John Nevis Andrew and J
[1438.1s] Wagon coming the fourth president of
[1440.6s] seventh adventist we are finding a man
[1442.8s] called George
[1446.0s] Butler elected from May December 1871 to
[1450.4s] August
[1452.8s] 1874. That is number
[1456.6s] five. Number five. Then comes number six
[1460.8s] again. Who is elected once more? The
[1463.4s] sixth
[1465.2s] one. I'm in the fifth or the sixth. The
[1468.6s] sixth. Now come who? Once again. So this
[1472.2s] is now the last time James White is
[1474.2s] finishing his work and now he's dying in
[1476.6s] the year
[1477.9s] 1881. James White worked from August
[1480.6s] 1872 to October 1880. How many years? 6
[1485.0s] years. But when we combine the years
[1487.0s] that James White have worked being told
[1489.4s] of James White was the president of
[1491.0s] general conference session in in 10
[1494.7s] years. When you combine those years, how
[1497.0s] many years are they? 10. In how many
[1499.4s] terms? theta terms. So you can write
[1503.3s] from the year 1865 to 1867. You also
[1506.5s] work 1869 to 1871. You also work 1874 to
[1511.5s] 1818. You can write that read that on
[1514.1s] Adventist pioneer biography and pictures
[1516.8s] page number 24 and the paragraph is
[1519.5s] paragraph number three. after start
[1522.4s] working then George Butler Texas once
[1525.3s] again in October
[1527.4s] 1880 up to October
[1531.0s] 1888 8 years elderlas now it is the the
[1536.0s] second term of elabler is working in a
[1538.9s] combination of
[1540.8s] 11
[1546.8s] years in 11 what years that is now
[1552.7s] Elder
[1554.6s] Batler. George Butler. Have you wrote?
[1557.4s] Have you right? Yes. We have You are
[1560.0s] going to another one. Another president
[1562.3s] of the Seventh Adventist whom you can
[1565.3s] know
[1568.1s] is
[1570.0s] Olen A. Olen working from
[1576.0s] October October 1888. It is just an
[1579.8s] October
[1580.8s] 1888 to February 18
[1585.3s] 97. Love comes another another president
[1588.4s] who is called
[1590.4s] George I
[1594.5s] George Owen working from February
[1597.1s] 1897 to April 1901.
[1603.4s] From now April 1901 to May
[1607.2s] 1922 we are finding also someone who is
[1609.8s] called Arthur G Daniel
[1612.5s] ag
[1614.0s] Daniels. Then there are another
[1616.7s] one. Then I run to my friend Nelie
[1620.7s] Wilson. Do you know Nelie Wilson? The
[1623.3s] father of
[1624.4s] four. Thank you. The father of Ted
[1627.6s] Wilson. So those are the
[1631.4s] uh general conference presidents that we
[1633.4s] can note in the development of the
[1635.8s] seventh day
[1638.0s] adventist. You cannot you can go and do
[1640.6s] your your research on your research on
[1644.0s] betweenness the presidents that you can
[1646.6s] find but them that can be noted as the
[1650.1s] pioneers of Adventist we are finding is
[1653.4s] the ones that have tried to I have tried
[1655.8s] to
[1656.8s] note I should go to another slide
[1660.3s] [Music]
[1672.4s] He served for a lot of
[1674.4s] years, not all the years, but there's a
[1677.6s] time
[1680.6s] that I he was keen on writing what on
[1684.7s] writing letters and writing reports and
[1686.7s] bookkeeping. He he really sufferable. It
[1688.9s] is more than now 20
[1691.8s] years. It is more than even 30 years. He
[1694.5s] really served and you when you go and
[1696.9s] read about the history of Rasm we are
[1698.7s] finding he was also good in writing
[1702.0s] editing and he was also because he was
[1705.2s] also what he could not be the president
[1707.2s] of the general conference because he
[1711.1s] was on the leg what leg feet.
[1717.9s] Yes, I that's why he could not serve as
[1720.3s] the general conference president because
[1723.0s] he lo what his land. So he could not
[1725.8s] move from this place to this place.
[1727.8s] That's why he was faithful in his work
[1729.9s] but he only serve as the
[1732.0s] secretary. So we now go because we
[1734.8s] looked that in the year 1860 we were
[1737.1s] given a name and for us to be given a
[1739.4s] name also we have to be given a sign to
[1741.8s] point that our name to also the
[1744.6s] demonstrate the nature of our work. What
[1748.7s] is the t
[1754.3s] [Music]
[1756.5s] Yes. The nature of our work. So we are
[1758.5s] going for our sign of the seventh
[1760.3s] adventist. you will allow me to go like
[1762.6s] this because I only want have one lesson
[1765.1s] before me but you can go and do your
[1767.5s] research. So the question what to be
[1769.9s] considered is what is our sign or our
[1772.8s] banner? We should be known by two things
[1775.6s] the nature of our work our character and
[1778.3s] the work we have been instructed to do
[1780.2s] which it is being pointed by our name.
[1782.8s] The also message that we bear as seventh
[1785.4s] day adventist. It is being pointed by
[1788.2s] our
[1790.4s] sign. So Psalm 60 verse number four here
[1794.3s] the words of the lord is saying that
[1796.0s] thou hast given a banner to them that
[1798.1s] fear thee that it may be displayed
[1800.7s] because of the truth that God has
[1804.2s] instructed to this church a banner. And
[1807.0s] when this banner is being displayed, it
[1809.4s] is being be displayed because of the
[1811.0s] truth. The Lord has given
[1813.7s] us. Psalms 20 verse number four verse
[1816.5s] number 5. We say that we will rejoice in
[1819.2s] the name of the uh we will rejoice in
[1821.3s] thy salvation and in the name of our God
[1824.1s] we will set us set up our banner. The
[1828.4s] Lord fulfill all thy
[1831.2s] petition. It means that because of the
[1833.5s] truth that we bear in the name of our of
[1836.3s] the Lord our God, we will come and set
[1839.3s] up our
[1841.6s] banner. So now comes that God give us a
[1845.5s] banner into 384 paragraph number three
[1849.6s] that the banner of the third angels has
[1851.4s] incribed upon the commandment of God and
[1854.2s] the faith of Jesus. Our institution have
[1856.9s] taken a name which set forth the
[1858.5s] character of our faith and of this name
[1861.2s] we are never to be ashamed. Praise God.
[1864.2s] I have been shown that this name means
[1866.1s] much and in adopting it we follow the
[1869.5s] light given us from heaven. It means
[1872.6s] that God has given us the banner of the
[1874.2s] three angels. What messages that is our
[1877.4s] banner that we were given by God. In the
[1881.3s] name of our Lord, we will set up our
[1884.9s] banner. Let's go. So question and
[1887.7s] question now you should consider and
[1891.4s] asked yourself when you look for the
[1894.2s] seventh adventures calling themselves
[1895.8s] general conference which has president
[1898.2s] which was established in the
[1900.0s] foundation. Question you should consider
[1902.3s] what happened to this logo then why
[1906.4s] this? What happened to this logo? Then
[1909.1s] why this? Let this question linger in
[1912.5s] your mind that what happened to this
[1914.6s] logo? Then why
[1917.2s] this? When we are looking on the history
[1919.8s] of the seventh day Adventist, we we come
[1922.6s] to realize that the history of the
[1924.2s] ancient Israel is a striking
[1926.0s] illustration of the past experience of
[1927.5s] the advent body. God led his people in
[1930.6s] the advent body even as he led the
[1932.6s] children of Israel from Egypt.
[1936.5s] It means that when there was a change in
[1938.6s] seventh adventist, it means that also
[1940.2s] Israel must have been this change. And
[1942.5s] for us to establish that that seventh
[1944.6s] adventist which called themselves so
[1946.7s] they are not the church of God. We also
[1948.5s] have to go and look for the earlier
[1950.4s] seventh adventist in the biblical
[1953.8s] context. Praise God. So there's
[1956.6s] something I really love in Deuteronomy
[1958.6s] 31 verse number
[1961.0s] 26 that now open your Bible. Deuteronomy
[1964.8s] 31 verse number 24 25 and
[1969.2s] 26 it says and it came to pass when
[1972.7s] Moses had made the end of the
[1975.4s] writing the words of this law in the
[1978.0s] book until they were finished that Moses
[1981.0s] commanded the le which bear the ark of
[1983.0s] the covenant said take this book of the
[1985.8s] law and put it in the side of the ark of
[1988.6s] the covenant of the Lord your God that
[1991.2s] it may be there for a witness against
[1995.2s] thee. So we are finding that when Moses
[1997.9s] had made the end of the writing and if
[2000.0s] you could have time I know you can go
[2001.7s] and investigate for yourself. We find we
[2004.6s] try in GC we come and realize that the
[2008.2s] history of the ancient Israel is also
[2009.9s] the history of the seventh seventh day
[2012.3s] adventist. It mean that
[2014.8s] if the ancient Israelites had a prophet
[2018.2s] also the seventh adventist must have a
[2020.1s] pro a prophets. That's why Isaiah 12:3
[2023.0s] he said that by a prophet the Lord
[2025.4s] brought Israel out of Egypt and by a
[2028.4s] prophet they were preserved. Also it
[2031.8s] means that by a prophet we were brought
[2034.6s] out of the world and also by a prophet
[2037.4s] we are going to be
[2040.3s] preserved and who is the prophet that
[2042.5s] has been extracted to this church.
[2046.5s] That's why also Israelites given the law
[2049.1s] of Moses and also given the commandment
[2051.2s] of God. Also this church is being given
[2054.7s] the law of God which is the scriptures
[2056.3s] and the spirit of prophecy. Linda
[2059.1s] messages 33 paragraph 4 is saying that
[2061.3s] the law of God and the spirit of
[2063.3s] prophecy go hand in hand to guide and
[2065.1s] cancel the church. And whenever the
[2067.3s] church has recognized this by obeying
[2069.3s] his law, the spirit of prophecy has been
[2071.7s] sent to guide her in the way of the
[2075.1s] truth.
[2077.8s] So the law of God, biblical Bible and
[2081.2s] the spirit of prophecy, they go hand in
[2083.6s] hand in guiding the church of
[2088.8s] God. So the question, what
[2091.8s] happened? What
[2094.9s] happened? The question is what happened
[2098.2s] to this logo and then why
[2102.4s] this? After the passing of bion the last
[2105.4s] pioneers in the year 1922 John not lo
[2110.3s] there comes now things started to change
[2113.0s] in seventh adventics that's why judges 2
[2116.6s] verse number 10 say the question you can
[2120.1s] see on the screen that from the b of the
[2123.1s] three angels messages of the seventh
[2125.3s] adventist to the the three wavy lines
[2129.3s] and the cross in its m east. what
[2132.7s] happened the thing that have happened to
[2135.4s] us that's why this church have taken his
[2137.6s] time to explain the two education
[2139.0s] messages because of judges 2 verse
[2140.6s] number 10 that happened in the ancient
[2142.8s] Israelites saying and also all that
[2145.6s] generation the pioneers the last one
[2148.1s] dying in the year 19:22 all this
[2150.8s] generation gathered unto their fathers
[2153.3s] and there arose another gen another
[2156.3s] generation after them which knew not the
[2159.1s] Lord nor yet the works
[2162.6s] which he had done for
[2165.0s] Israel. After the pioneers passed, there
[2167.7s] arose another another what another body.
[2170.5s] There was another people which knew not
[2172.6s] God. All the things that he had done yet
[2175.6s] done. They knew not God. It means that
[2177.9s] now the trinity god must do what? The
[2180.2s] trinity god must happen. So now see the
[2184.7s] prediction of apostasy in that judges 31
[2188.7s] verse number 26 to 29. You see the
[2191.3s] parallel of Moses and Ellen White when
[2193.4s] they are predicted what is going to
[2195.1s] happen in seventh adventism. Look and
[2197.4s] read with me kingly. See this predicted
[2200.8s] apostasy. Last warning of Moses before
[2204.0s] death. These are the last warning that
[2206.2s] Moses is giving to the church before
[2207.9s] death that take this book of the law and
[2210.8s] put it in the side of the ark of
[2212.6s] covenant of the Lord your God that it
[2216.2s] may be for a witness against thee. For I
[2219.9s] know thy rebellion and thy stiffness.
[2223.5s] Behold, while I am yet alive with you
[2227.1s] this day, you have been rebellious
[2229.6s] against the Lord. And how much more
[2232.0s] after my
[2234.2s] death? Moses is saying that when I am
[2236.7s] with you now, you are following, you are
[2239.0s] going into apostasy. Then how after my
[2242.2s] death?
[2244.9s] Gather unto me all the elders of your
[2247.2s] tribe and your officers that I may speak
[2250.5s] these words in their ears and call
[2252.6s] heaven and earth to records against
[2255.0s] them. Moses is making his last work. So
[2258.8s] consider chapter verse number 29. For I
[2262.1s] know that after my death ye will utterly
[2266.1s] corrupt yourself and know and turn aside
[2270.2s] from the way which I have commanded you
[2273.0s] and evil will befall you in the latter
[2275.8s] days because you will do evil in the
[2278.2s] sight of God to provoke him to anger
[2280.7s] through the work of your hand that after
[2283.9s] my death you will go into what?
[2287.2s] Apostasy. This is the prediction of
[2292.0s] who that take the Bible and the spirit
[2295.2s] of prophecy. They have to go hand in
[2297.8s] hand. I know that after my death
[2301.0s] rebellion will come. When I am still yet
[2303.4s] alive with thee, you have brought the
[2304.7s] what? The apostasy. What that thing
[2307.5s] happened in the seventh adventist before
[2309.1s] the death of Ellen White? There comes
[2314.0s] apostasy. Let me proceed. Now you write
[2316.3s] this book.
[2318.7s] 25 LTMS manuscript one of 1915 paragraph
[2324.0s] 2 start with paragraph
[2327.3s] 2 that see this predicted apostasy last
[2330.5s] warning of Moses before death also see
[2334.3s] this Ellen White last warning before
[2336.3s] death as
[2337.5s] was this this predicted
[2341.2s] apostasy M 25 MTMS manuscript one of
[2346.5s] 1950 15 paragraph 2 is saying that I
[2349.3s] tell you now that I when I am laid to
[2351.8s] rest great changes will
[2357.3s] take this the words of
[2359.6s] Moses for I know 27 for I know thy
[2363.1s] rebellion and thy stiff neck because
[2366.2s] behold while I am yet alive with you
[2369.0s] this day you have been rebellious
[2371.7s] against God and how much more after my
[2375.4s] death Now Ellen White is writing that I
[2378.1s] tell you now. This in the year
[2380.8s] 195. I tell you now that when I am laid
[2384.9s] to rest great changes will take place. I
[2388.2s] do not know when I shall be taken and I
[2391.2s] desire to warn you all against the
[2392.9s] devices of devil. I want the people to
[2395.7s] know that I warned them fully before my
[2400.2s] death. I warned you fully before my
[2402.8s] death. The is saying that I warn you
[2404.9s] fully before my death. I do not know
[2407.5s] especially what changes will take place
[2409.8s] but they should watch every conceivable
[2411.8s] sin that Satan will try to
[2415.1s] immortalize. I do not know when I will
[2417.3s] be late to rest but when I'm late to
[2419.8s] rest great changes will take place.
[2422.4s] That's why is writing in one page 204
[2426.3s] paragraph number two. Write and read
[2428.3s] with me kindly line upon
[2431.2s] line. It say that the enemy of the soul
[2433.9s] has sought to bring in the supposition
[2436.2s] that a great reformation will take place
[2438.6s] among the seventh
[2441.3s] adventist. The enemy of the soul who is
[2443.6s] the devil. He has sought to bring
[2446.1s] suppososition that a great reformation
[2448.6s] was to take place among the seventh day
[2451.4s] Adventist and that this reformation will
[2454.5s] consist in giving up the doctrine we
[2457.8s] stand as the pillars of our faith and
[2460.0s] engaging in the process of
[2463.6s] reorganization. It mean that seventh
[2465.6s] adventist it reach a point that they
[2467.8s] must be
[2468.9s] reorganized. They must give their
[2472.0s] doctrines and they fulfill the
[2475.0s] prophecy. So question what this
[2477.7s] reformation to take place what will
[2480.8s] result? So you should
[2483.2s] write if reformation which was predicted
[2485.8s] by Moses and Ellen White will take place
[2487.8s] what will result? Number two number one
[2490.9s] what will result? The principle of truth
[2494.2s] that God in his wisdom has given to the
[2496.6s] remnant church will be discarded. That
[2499.3s] is number
[2504.0s] one. What this reformation to take
[2506.2s] place, what will result? Number one, the
[2509.7s] principle of truth that God is in his
[2512.9s] wisdom has given to the remnant church
[2514.6s] will be
[2516.7s] discarded. The medicine was medicine
[2519.3s] school
[2520.4s] sold. Did it enter
[2522.9s] apostasy? Was our publishing house
[2526.9s] sold? Was our sanitarium
[2530.3s] sold? Number two, our religion will be
[2535.7s] changed. Number three, the fundamental
[2538.8s] principles that have sustained the work
[2540.9s] for the last 50 years will be discarded
[2543.0s] as error. It means that our truth was
[2546.8s] going to be discarded as error. Number
[2549.5s] four, a new organization will be
[2552.7s] established. Which organization was
[2554.6s] established? General Conference of 7th
[2556.6s] Day Adventist Church. It means that they
[2559.7s] must establish another organization with
[2562.4s] different name with different banner
[2565.0s] with different teachings.
[2569.2s] Numbers of new order will be written.
[2573.4s] Those are the four things that happened.
[2575.8s] Five things. So now look, books of new
[2579.6s] orders was written. Number four book was
[2582.6s] which was written is living temple. I
[2585.0s] just noted because I don't know if
[2587.4s] Friday I will find time to speak about
[2589.1s] the alpha and omega of apostasy but you
[2591.8s] can go and investigate if I will not
[2593.9s] talk about the alpha and omega of
[2595.2s] apostasy that the book living temple
[2598.1s] which contain pantheism the teaching of
[2599.9s] the pantheism which is the strength the
[2602.2s] personality of the father and the
[2605.3s] son number two book which was written it
[2608.6s] question on doctrine that is now the the
[2612.5s] living temple is the alpha of apostasy
[2615.1s] and question of doctrine is the omega of
[2617.1s] the
[2619.4s] apostasy. Number four book which is the
[2622.4s] movement of destiny written by Leroy
[2625.7s] Fume and also the coming of the
[2627.6s] comforter written by Leroy F and
[2630.1s] defending the god which is written by
[2632.0s] Vance farm who have read the defending
[2635.1s] defending godhead. Have you seen that
[2639.0s] book? Those are the books of new god.
[2641.4s] You cannot s but
[2645.7s] books of new order will be written.
[2648.8s] Number two, we find that the fundamental
[2651.9s] principles that have sustained the work
[2654.4s] for the last 50 years will be discarded
[2656.5s] as error. How were they discarded? Can
[2660.6s] you look that timeline? In the year
[2663.1s] 1872, it was the declaration of the
[2665.6s] fundamental principle of 7th day
[2668.4s] Adventist. Reaching the year 1874, the
[2672.4s] 1872 fundamental principles were
[2676.3s] published. One was published by James
[2678.8s] White in science of times. You can go
[2680.7s] and look in the blue estate. It is
[2682.1s] there. The second one was was published
[2685.0s] by Smith in a publishing house called
[2686.9s] review and herald.
[2690.8s] Reaching the year
[2692.8s] 1889, fundamental principle
[2695.7s] was expanded to 28 without the trinity
[2701.9s] doctrine. Now come the year 1915. The
[2705.0s] old seventh adventist have been started
[2707.0s] to be changed. The doctrine has been
[2709.4s] started to be changed. Now they come out
[2712.6s] to the year 1931. Now the yearbooks here
[2715.7s] book the yearbook with new beliefs. Now
[2718.8s] it is published. Having the trinity
[2721.1s] doctrine at the second
[2723.6s] fundamental
[2726.8s] principle the third if reformation will
[2729.4s] take place what will result our
[2731.3s] religion will be changed and a new
[2734.5s] organization will be
[2737.0s] formed let me question what to be
[2740.9s] considered I'm asking you a question and
[2743.1s] prepare me answer me quickly how can I
[2745.8s] change the bu a Buddhist or Islam to be
[2749.0s] a
[2750.0s] Christian. How can I change a Buddhist
[2752.4s] or an Islam to be a Christian?
[2757.1s] Yes.
[2759.0s] I'm changing Buddha and I'm changing
[2761.0s] Allah and bringing to them to the
[2762.7s] knowledge of the one true God. How can I
[2766.3s] change old DA church to be
[2769.5s] Catholics? Changing one true God and
[2771.7s] bringing up who? The Trinity God.
[2775.8s] Is it simple like that? For me to change
[2778.6s] Buddha, Buddhist to be to be Christian,
[2781.2s] I change Buddha. For me to change Islam,
[2783.8s] now I change Allah and they come and
[2786.2s] worship the one true God. It means that
[2789.4s] our religion will be changed. Seventh
[2791.7s] Adventist was changed when they accepted
[2794.2s] what the Trinity
[2796.5s] doctrine. So now read the words of Nelie
[2799.6s] Wilson. The year 1981, LC Wilson,
[2803.1s] General Conference president, announced
[2805.4s] that the church has officially adopted
[2808.2s] the Trinity Doctrine, which is now
[2810.5s] number two in the church 28 fundamental
[2813.7s] beliefs. Not now they are not principle,
[2816.6s] but they are now beliefs. Pastor Nell
[2820.6s] Wilson while president of general
[2823.3s] conference of seventh adventist. He
[2826.2s] declares before the seventh adventist
[2828.0s] church that there is another universal
[2830.9s] and truly Catholic organization. The
[2833.7s] seventh day Adventist church. They are
[2837.5s] not now seventh adventist but they are
[2839.7s] another universal organization. Catholic
[2842.3s] church. Seventh 7th day
[2845.1s] Adventist. Our
[2847.2s] religion will be done what will be
[2850.0s] changed. It is also predicted in Bible
[2853.5s] that when they enter a new organization
[2856.7s] will be formed. Now there comes new 7th
[2859.7s] day
[2861.5s] Adventist. It is being predicted in the
[2863.8s] Psalm 74 verse number four. For them to
[2866.9s] change seventh adventist fooling. Psalm
[2869.5s] 74 verse number four. And I jump to
[2872.2s] verse number 8 9 10 and 11 is saying
[2874.4s] that thine enemy ro in thy midst. Who is
[2877.3s] the
[2878.2s] enemy? Satan. And white have predicted
[2881.1s] that the enemy of the soul sought to
[2883.0s] bring in supposition in the seventh
[2886.3s] adventist. So th enemies ro in the midst
[2889.8s] of their congregation. The enemy entered
[2892.2s] the seventh adventist. Then they set up
[2894.8s] their banners. They set up their sign.
[2900.6s] They verse number eight saying they said
[2902.6s] in their heart let us destroy them
[2905.2s] together. They have burnt up all the
[2908.2s] synagogues of the god in thy
[2911.0s] land. Then we as old seven elephantes
[2914.4s] now are crying that we see not our
[2916.8s] signs. There's no any other prophet
[2919.4s] among us. Elen wise has been stoned and
[2923.3s] killed among us any knoweth how long.
[2928.7s] And you will read Proverbs 28 28:19 or
[2932.2s] 29:18. Where there's no vision, people
[2935.4s] perish. Where the prophet, where there's
[2937.6s] no prophet, people are going to do what?
[2939.4s] To
[2940.3s] perish. So after the enemy have set up
[2943.1s] their sign, now comes in verse number
[2945.9s] 10. Oh God, how long shall the adversary
[2949.4s] approach? Shall the enemy blasphem thy
[2952.0s] name forever? Then we are being asked,
[2954.9s] God is withdrawing his hand. Why
[2958.4s] withdraw thou thy hand? Even thy right
[2961.2s] hand pluck it out of thy
[2964.5s] bosom. So it forces God to now withdraw
[2967.8s] his son from that 7day Catholic and God
[2971.3s] may raise up his church once
[2974.4s] more. The enemy entered the church.
[2977.5s] There come a communical movement in the
[2979.4s] church and see the commandment the
[2980.9s] command of God. The adversary has spread
[2983.4s] out his hand upon all thy pleasant
[2986.0s] things. For she had seen that the hidden
[2990.2s] entered into her sanctuary whom thou
[2993.0s] didest command that they should not
[2994.9s] enter into thy congregation. God
[2998.3s] commanded that the hidden seven advent
[3001.7s] should
[3003.0s] not do a chemical movement but the
[3006.9s] enemy try to do what? To get in. to get
[3011.2s] in. I don't just have a phone but in
[3014.6s] five of page 90
[3017.1s] something that coming the 1860 what 1863
[3021.8s] the executive
[3022.9s] committee 6 then three then
[3026.5s] what then 11 then 13 then
[3036.2s] 25 for to call theirselves gone. So see
[3041.9s] how our banner is being changed and how
[3044.2s] this religion is being formed on another
[3046.3s] religion. Then I just finish. Go with
[3048.3s] me. Ezekiel 8 verse number 14 to
[3051.1s] 16. He's saying then he brought me to
[3054.3s] the door of the gate of the Lord's house
[3057.0s] which was towards the north and behold
[3060.4s] there sat a woman weeping for tamuz.
[3065.4s] So it means that the church of God there
[3067.4s] come a point that they started to
[3069.0s] worship
[3070.8s] Damos. Consider verse 15 and 16. He's
[3073.7s] saying, "Then said he unto me, hast thou
[3077.0s] seen this, oh son of man, turn thee yet
[3080.6s] again, and thou shalt see greater
[3083.1s] abomination than you are seeing now?"
[3086.0s] And he brought me into the inner court
[3088.2s] of the Lord's house. And behold, at the
[3090.6s] door of the temple of the Lord, between
[3092.7s] the porch and the altar, about five and
[3097.0s] 20 men with their backs towards the
[3100.2s] temple of the Lord, and their faces
[3102.3s] towards the east, and they worship the
[3105.1s] sons towards the
[3107.2s] east. So see what is being done in the
[3109.7s] church of God. They bring up taboos.
[3112.2s] Number one. Number two, they start
[3114.5s] worshiping the sun. The sun is worshiped
[3117.0s] in three
[3122.0s] ways. How can I put in English? When sun
[3124.9s] is arising, the midday and what? When
[3127.7s] sun is setting. So it is God the father,
[3130.7s] God the son and God the holy spirit. See
[3134.7s] we have three stages of
[3137.5s] sun and here is so they start worshiping
[3141.2s] the trinity god.
[3143.8s] When the sun is coming from this side on
[3146.2s] the middle, God the father, God the son
[3148.2s] and God the holy
[3149.9s] spirit. Beside worshiping the son, the
[3152.7s] trinity god, they also start to worship
[3155.0s] what?
[3156.8s] Tamuz. What does tamuz means in seventh
[3159.2s] day adventist? Go with me.
[3162.1s] HBS.
[3165.6s] HBS. HBS page
[3168.9s] 145.4. So you see cross Babylonian
[3172.4s] origin. He's saying that the same sign
[3175.1s] of the cross that Rome now worshiped was
[3178.3s] used in Babylonian mysteries. Read with
[3181.5s] me was applied by paganism to sign magic
[3185.6s] purposes was honored with the same
[3188.8s] honors. Then that which is now called
[3191.9s] the Christian cross was originally not
[3195.4s] Christian emblem at all but was the
[3199.4s] mystic tu of the chaldines and
[3203.1s] Egyptians. The true origin from the
[3205.5s] letter T the initial name of Tamuz. So
[3209.8s] where does the cross come
[3211.6s] from? The Chaldans and the Egyptians and
[3214.6s] the Babylonians. That's why the cross is
[3217.5s] letter T. Do you see
[3221.0s] that when it is to to really come
[3223.7s] apostate they must bring that cross into
[3226.4s] the church they must also worship the
[3229.2s] trinity
[3232.5s] god are you getting me that's why now
[3237.0s] when you term seventh advent now you
[3239.0s] find two people old seventh adventist
[3240.7s] and new 7th day adventist it is
[3243.4s] predicted by len white in 2 SMPP 385
[3246.2s] paragraph number two he's saying that a
[3248.2s] company was presented before me under
[3250.1s] the name Seventh Day Adventist who were
[3253.0s] advising that the banner or sign which
[3255.9s] make us a distinct people should not be
[3258.7s] held. So strikingly they're saying that
[3261.8s] this banner really separate us from many
[3265.2s] denominations. Now they saying that the
[3267.2s] banner of the three angels we should not
[3269.8s] like that. Then they remove the banner
[3272.3s] when the adversary come in. Now the
[3274.2s] adversary set up is what? the banner,
[3276.8s] the banner of the devil. For they claim
[3279.6s] that it was not the best policy of
[3281.3s] securing sus institution. But this
[3285.0s] distinct banner is to be born through
[3287.6s] the world to the clause of
[3291.3s] probation. You read great controversy
[3293.5s] page 568 paragraph number two say that
[3295.8s] papies place crosses upon their judges
[3298.5s] upon their altars and upon their
[3301.8s] garments. also seventh adventist papers
[3306.2s] all Catholic seventh day Adventist place
[3309.0s] crosses upon their churches upon their
[3312.5s] altars and upon their
[3316.3s] sit that and the angel only they are
[3320.7s] wise seven is already wise people are
[3324.5s] placing using
[3326.8s] what unithood but they are placing using
[3330.8s] comp computers
[3333.2s] computer. But they are placing using
[3336.4s] what? Some are placing using the
[3340.4s] hoods. Everywhere seen the insignia of
[3343.0s] the cross. Everywhere it
[3345.2s] is outwardly honored and exalted by the
[3348.8s] teaching of Christ are buried beneath
[3350.3s] the mass of sens tradition, false
[3352.6s] interpretation and uh rigorous exaction.
[3358.1s] So, a question worth asking asking you
[3361.7s] as I
[3363.6s] finish. Do you look on the screen? A
[3367.0s] question worth asking. I'm asking you a
[3370.0s] question in the book of Psalms 11 verse
[3372.2s] number
[3373.3s] 13. I'm asking you a
[3376.8s] question. Psalms 11 verse number three.
[3380.2s] That if the foundation be destroyed,
[3383.1s] what can the Russians do?
[3387.9s] If the foundation had destroyed, what
[3389.8s] can the Russians do?
[3394.2s] Who can give me clear answer? If the
[3395.8s] foundation, if Steven has really been
[3400.0s] destroyed, what can the Russians
[3403.9s] do? Who can give me the answer? Felix.
[3407.5s] What can the Russians do?
[3411.0s] rebuilding the the answer is in the book
[3413.7s] of Isaiah
[3414.9s] 58:12. Question is, if the foundation be
[3418.0s] destroyed, what can the Russians do?
[3420.8s] Then he say, "And they that shall be
[3423.4s] shall uh they that shall be of thee
[3426.0s] shall build the old waste places. Thou
[3429.7s] shall raise up the foundation of many
[3431.5s] generation, and thou shalt be called the
[3433.7s] repairers of the bridge, the restorers
[3435.8s] of the path to dwell in." Praise God. So
[3439.8s] our work is to go to the old west places
[3443.7s] and do what? And
[3445.8s] rebuild because the command now come
[3448.2s] that we should not come out of the old
[3452.0s] landmarks. That's why God is saying in
[3454.2s] the book of Jeremiah 6 verse number 16
[3455.9s] that thus says the Lord stand in the
[3458.4s] way. When we are being published like
[3460.2s] this what should we do? We stand in the
[3463.3s] way and see and ask for the old 7th day
[3466.6s] Adventist church and ask that where is
[3469.6s] the old seventh adventist doctrine and
[3472.4s] walk therein and we are going to find
[3474.8s] rest in the second advent of
[3477.9s] Christ. Now God is
[3481.0s] calling now God is calling us to restore
[3484.8s] and be old 7th day Adventist. That's why
[3488.6s] we are calling ourselves old what?
[3492.2s] Rebuilding the old foundation. The
[3496.0s] commandment came in proverbs
[3498.7s] 22:28 that remove not the ancient
[3501.2s] landmarks which thy fathers have
[3504.0s] said that is the command that came
[3506.9s] because Deuteronomy 32:7 in that ask thy
[3509.4s] fathers and they will shield thee.
[3513.0s] Proverbs 32:28 that remove not the
[3515.0s] ancient landmarks we thy fathers have
[3517.2s] set. Remove not the old landmarks and
[3519.5s] enter not in the fields of the fathers.
[3522.7s] God is calling us to the three angels
[3524.6s] message of 7th Adventist church. We are
[3527.4s] being called to restore our
[3529.4s] banner to become all seventh day
[3532.5s] Adventist. But when we are come to
[3534.5s] rebuild the whole foundation I want you
[3535.9s] to mark this point. Mark this point. We
[3540.9s] not are coming here. We are not coming
[3542.1s] with the mind of the world. But mark
[3544.6s] this point. 1 Corinthians 3 11. For
[3547.7s] other foundation can no man lay than
[3550.4s] that which is laid than that is laid
[3553.8s] which is Jesus Christ. We are not laying
[3557.4s] any other foundation. We are not we are
[3560.2s] not doing anything but we are being
[3562.0s] called to rebel. To rebel. No any other
[3565.3s] foundation can we lay. We can start.
[3567.6s] know any other church than that which
[3569.8s] was laid by who? By Jesus Christ. But
[3573.7s] when we have come to what to lay the
[3576.9s] first lesson was the foundation of our
[3578.9s] work. We go to Ephesians 2 verse number
[3581.4s] 20. We say that are built upon the
[3584.0s] foundation of the apostle and the
[3586.3s] prophets. Jesus Christ himself being the
[3588.9s] chief cornerstone. And of the first
[3591.2s] lesson when we are rebuilding we are
[3593.2s] going first to Jesus who is the Bible
[3595.2s] and the scriptures. We are going to
[3597.7s] build also from the pioneers who is
[3600.2s] Ellen White writings and also we are
[3603.2s] going to the apostles who are the pio
[3606.3s] pioneers. Praise
[3608.4s] God. We are being called mark this
[3612.7s] point that we are being called to build
[3615.0s] upon the old foundation. I should learn
[3618.2s] my lesson at that point because my time
[3620.1s] is much spent. In the next lesson I will
[3622.7s] try so much
[3624.0s] to I should handle something on
[3628.0s] the I've tried to handle but I will try
[3632.8s] to finish my lesson on Friday. Is there
[3634.9s] anyone with a
[3636.4s] question
[3639.5s] then I pray then I give you chance.
[3642.6s] Thank you. Can you can you pray then I
[3645.2s] give you
[3648.5s] chance?

[3656.8s] so much for this wonderful morning.
[3659.7s] Thank you for the word that thou have
[3661.1s] shared with us. I really plead before
[3662.6s] the cross that before the close of
[3665.0s] probation, may you help us to restore
[3667.3s] the old foundation and go back to the
[3669.8s] old seventh adventist and walk in the
[3672.2s] true principles of thine way. I really
[3674.6s] pray may you help that children who are
[3676.2s] making decision to stand within the ways
[3677.8s] of righteousness that they may not
[3680.2s] remove the old landmarks. Above all may
[3682.5s] thy will be done. I plead in Jesus name.
