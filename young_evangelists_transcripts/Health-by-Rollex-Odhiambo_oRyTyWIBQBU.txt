FULL TRANSCRIPT:
lesson on drugs. I will just like us to read something here that we never read last time that also was still commenting on drugs because today many people we learn that many people have been sick and they are not getting the right treatment that they should have. So today I want us also to look in this part. Just recently we had that help from America. The American World Health Organization will not be issuing drugs to Africa. Now this took many with worry as now many people who are suffering from HIV AIDS, malaria, TB among many other diseases will not now be receiving this drugs and many people were worried that with the situation. Uh Kenyans faces HIV treatment crisis as only 6 months supply of ARV drugs remaining. So many people have been worried that when there is no supply of these drugs, what is the way forward or what is the solution? We've learned that we have reached at a time that we are going to preach these messages so that people might understand that there is hope when we believe in Christ. uh and many people were worrying how were they going to help themselves. So we are being told that the medical fraternity that is from the book 16 MR just as I want to connect my lesson from the point I left under the drugs right len white writes that the medical fraternity represented me as freeman. So we can just highlight that book and note it down that medical fraternity of the world it is freemanor. If we look the logo of health organization, which logo is that? It is over snail. That means that is what a free man. It continuates the medical fraternity presented to me as freman sorry with their long unintelligible names which common people cannot understand. The drugs are having some names that common people cannot watch cannot understand. For example, who can understand what is omerazol? Omethrosol is a drug that is used in the cases of alers. Who can understand what is omerazol and how it is being made? We see we cannot understand and we don't know what are the uh components that are being used to make that drug. For example, flagagile. So they are names even doctor themselves cannot understand what they are administering to the people. So what we must understand that this is a witchcraft and a sorcery that Satan has brought so many people might die at earlier age. It continue readings cannot understand will call the Lord's prescription for Ezekiel quackery. Death was pronounced upon the king but he prayed for life and his prayer was heard. Those who are the care of him were told to get a bunch of figs and put them on so and the king was restored. This means was taken by God to teach them. So in the Bible traces we are not finding any place that drugs are are recommended for human treatment. So what we must understand that we are living at a time that Satan has studied the science of the laboratories and now what Satan is going to do is going to bring and advertise more chemicals. I would like us also to read from the book of great controversy page 559 paragraph 2 and we we see the plan of Satan with the drug medication because even now as the plans of Jesuit disorder if you go through them they say that they will use drugs so that they kill people slowly. What we understand with the drug will not kill someone within a day but it is slow and sure killing to the system. So can we be there? Satan works through the elements also to Ghana service of unprepared souls. He has studied the secrets of the laboratories of nature. Now being that Satan is a student of true education, he has studied the laboratories of nature. He know the med the remedy that can help man. But having the knowledge that he can also make chemicals, he have used it more than required and he uses all his power to control the element as far as God allows. So in these last days, Satan is controlling the laboratories because Satan is having an agree project to the world under medical treatment. So many people think that when they go to the hospital it is uh it is that they think that doctors love them that somehow some you will find some people saving a number of doctor a doctor saying Dr. who and who he has been helping me. You can also have his number. No, doctors are not our friends. But they don't love us but they love our money. Because we know and understand that the project of medicine, it is the expensive business under the world. Why? Because drugs that are being issued and ministered to the people, they do not cure diseases. Now they will make you into in a continual way that you will you use them daily as Elder said that it is a fact and true that it is a business. So it continues saying he will favor and prosper some in order to further his own designs and he will bring trouble upon others and lead and lead men to believe that that it is God who is afflicting them. Now we understand and as we just read that this business that is being conducted by Satan himself through the many people or through a name called medicine medicine we know that this is the sorcery of the papacy. These are the plans of the papacy that they may destroy people and kill people in an earlier age so that people do not make decisions. In the book of Revelation chapter 18 verse 23, can someone read? It says shall no more. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Shall be heard no more. Uhhuh. Uh-huh. For thy merchants were the great men of the earth today. Who are the great men of the earth? the merchants, the businessmen. But what are they selling to the people? Things that harm the system and things that kill people's law. But sure, continue reading. For by thy sorceries today, the only is deceived because the sorcery of the great men who are deceiving people. So sorcery is full everywhere. Today even food many foods that are being made. For example, today we have plastic cabbages, we have plastic rice. These are sorceries that are killing people slowly by slowly. So that what I wanted to understand that the project of medicine it is a project of Satan himself because it is a sorcery and it is a a witchcraft. Just Ellen White as he was shown he have told us that medical fraternity is what a free m. So what are the freemasons and what are their aims? If drug if the drug uh the drug itself uh the drug company is being supported with free mans what is the aim to destroy. So today I would like us to enter into the solution because we were looking way forward. We have learned that the drug is not the way. So today I would like us to look some remedies that is going to help our system and uh this is the point that we stopped at last time. Someone can echo it again from the book of Jeremiah 8 verse 21. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Mhm. Uhhuh. Why God is that? Because of the kind of treatment and medication that people are pursuing from Satan himself. Verse 22. It says, "If there are no is there no bulb in Gilead?" Is there no bulb in Gilead? is no is there no physician there? And that is the question that we asked last time that is there no physician in the places we live. Is there no B the world we are living? But we need to answer that there is B and thereians because God has called us to be what? to be medical missionaries who are going to understand the cause of diseases and the medication itself. Let us move forward. The book of U PH this is 14 sorry for 1144 8.1 I'm just missing for there that reads the the simple remedies are less harmful than drug poisons in reion to their simplicity but in every many cases these are used when not at all necessary. The next paragraph, there are simple herbs and roots that every family may use for themselves. So, every family to use what? Herbs. We are being told that every family to use what? Herbs. Because Mhm. Continue reading. Simple. They are simple herbs. Pick themselves call in a physician. Uhhuh. any sooner than they will call a lawyer. So there are there are many harms and even roots that can help so that people might not be calling physician each and every time. Today why many people are calling physicians because they do not understand how the system how the body system works. So if you understand how our body system works, we are not going to call manians because we have hs everywhere. We have roots everywhere. Mhm. The book of CME 29 paragraph 4. You can also note that one. And we see the need of workers today because after learning that the drugs are no solution to our life, we need now to go to the chief physician who is Christ. Even Christ never administered drugs to the patients he attended to. But also Christ gave them the natural way that God has commanded. It reads workers workers gospel uh gospel medical missionaries are needed now. When are the gospel uh when are the workers gospel missionaries needed? Now it is now. Continue. You cannot afford to spend years in preparation. We can just not say that we are year after year we are still preparing to do the work. Soon doors now open. Soon doors now open. Soon doors now open. The truth will be forever closed to the truth will be forever closed. Carry the message now. Carry the message now. Not wait. And not wait. Allow the Do not wait. Allow the enemy to take possession Uhhuh. of the fields now open before you. Continue reading. Let compassy go forth to do the work to which Christ appointed his disciples let them labor as evangelists. Let us now labor as evangelists. Scattering our publications. scattering our publications and talking of the truth to those they meet. Let them pray for the sick. Let them pray for the sick. Ministering to their necessities. Uh-huh. Not with drugs. Not with drugs. Not with drugs. Uhhuh. But with nature's remedies. But with nature's remedy and teaching them how to regain health and teaching now people how to regain health and avoid disease. And avoid disease. So today we are being called as evangelist. We are being called as medical missionary to scatter the publication that carries the old truth that we proclaim. Because sometimes in the message will not be some people may not have heard the message but through our publications we will write and we will publish and people might know what they must what they must believe or what they must trust including the first annual message. The second, the third because in the third message it carry the various messages that is the book CME page 29 paragraph 4. Then 90 then ministry of billing page 147 90 page sorry 90 page 172 paragraph 4. It reads that let them labor as evangelists scattering our publication and taking and talking of the truth to those they meet. Let them pray for the sick, ministering to their necessities, not with drugs, but with nature's remedy and teaching them how to regain health and avoid diseases. And that is the responsibility that Christ has given us so that we may labor much that people may live in a way that they cannot be affected by diseases and give them the the present truth. Also the book of medical the book of ministry of healing page 146 paragraph 1 it reads it reads all gospel workers all gospel workers should know how to give the simple treatments all all all yes to mean all if you are a gospel worker you you are not a medical missionary are you fulfilling the law that are you fulfilling the work that Christ gave but you are being told that all workers whether you are young or old we should have a knowledge on how to give what simple treatments because we have several simple treatments for example we have hydrotherapy those are the kinds of simple treatments that we can have we have physiootherapy the massage those are the kind of simple treatments that each and every one of us have to know. So make sure that after coming from this place as a gospel worker, you have a eat of giving simple treatments that do so much to relieve pain and remove disease because soon as we have been told that the work of gospel work may is going to be closed. But if we have knowledge on how to give simple treatments that do so much to relieve pain and remove diseases many many doors are going to be open. Just continue reading with the next paragraph there. Every disease every every gospel worker every gospel worker will feel that the giving of instruction uh in the principles of healthful living uh is a part his appoint is is a part of his appointed work. So we have today many ministers who are saying that with me I'm not a medical missionary I'm just I'm I'm just interested in other part but we are being told that every gospel worker should feel that the giving of instruction the principle of healthful living is a is a part of it appointed work. So each and every individual has what? Something to do something to do. We cannot just relax that we have the the medical missionary department. The medical missionary department is not for what individual person but it's a call to everyone that they should feel and understand the responsibility that Christ has given them. Continue reading it of this work. Uhhuh. There's a great need. There is a great need and the world is open for it today. Every place there is there is no one who is going to reject the work of medical missionary because everywhere people are sick. Everywhere people need the true treating of the true method of treating the body. That's we have read from the book ministry of healing page 147. You can also write it down. So we understand that each and every person as an individual work to have the knowledge in simple treatment of disease and relieving pain and even removing the disease. But as you have learned the last time that removing disease we must understand the cause and the cause must be what? The cause must be agent. If we understand that method, that true method of healing, we are going to help many and we are going to bring many people to Christ. So this is the method and the way that Christ has gave that as he sent his disciples to be missionaries who will understand the necessities of giving the right principles of health to people who need Christ. Today in the book of um PH PH 1448 paragraph 3. It reads it says it says I do not think that I can give you any definite line of medicine compounded and and dealt out by doctors that are harm that are perfectly harmless. Uh-huh. And yet and yet it will not be wisdom to engage in controversy. Mhm. Over this subject just leave from that point. I think we have written it down. We will you will still read it later because of time. Let me go to another one another quote. That one we have look. So after having learned that we want to look various simple remedies that is going to help us because we say that our food should be what? Our should our food should be our medicine but we should not take medic we should not take medicine as what? As food. So we want to look various remedies that today we have prepared so that we might understand the time we are living. We read that one last time. I will not read it again. Now we will read from the book medical missionary page 320 paragraph 2 and paragraph 3. It says it says learn how to combat disease. Now that is the major point that you need to understand from out from this place that you you should know how to combat what disease. Know how to combat what? Disease. Continue. Gather up all the knowledge possible that will help to combat disease. So it is still your work to do what? To gather all knowledge possible that will help to combat disease. How are you going to gather this knowledge? It is through reading various of what books that are teaching about health and our hearts. It says it says in every place in every place the sick may be found. The sick may be found and those who go forth as workers for Christ those who go forth as workers of Christ should be true health reformers should be true health reformers prepare to give those who are seek the simple treatment that will relieve them and then pray with them. Yeah. Thus they will open the door for the entrance of the truth. Uhhuh. The doing of this work will be followed by good result. Uh-huh. Our Sabbath keeping families should keep their mind filled with helpful principles of health reform and other lines of truth that they may be a help to their neighbors. Amen. Be practical missionaries. So what is needed for us now the time of living that we be what? Practical missionaries. Practical missionaries. Gather up all knowledge possible that will help to combat disease. Amen. This just that point also read HL page 19 paragraph 5 HL. It is the duty of every person to become intelligent in regard to disease and it causes. So we have a work to do to become intelligent in regard to disease and it causes and that is the great work that each and every person need to do. Mhm. Yeah, just again in the book of WM page 127 paragraph one it says it says God's people God's people should know how to give the simple treatments Uhhuh. that do much to relieve pain. Uhhuh. And to remove diseases and to remove disaseshu eggs and pains Uhhuh. have left you without the use of medicine. What is the definition of disease? What is the definition of disease? Disease is an effort of nature to free the system from conditions. Mhm. That result from a violation of the laws of health. So I think that foundation that I have built, it is enough for us to have knowledge in combating diseases and even relieving pain in using some simple remedies. And now one of the simple remedies that we will like and start off is some of kind of foods is kind of food that many people know and many people use. So the best natural remedies that we should know it is keeping the commandments of God and eight laws of health. Why? Because number one, we understand that if we go against law number four that speak about water and we if we go against law number four, we know very well that a lot of water is required into the system. Number one, who knows the work of the water in the system into the system. Number one, we have various work of water in the body. Number one, gas exchange. Number two, uh, number three, we don't know the uses of water in the body. Digestion. What helps to cool the system? Digestion. Digestion. Another one. What about the body? Even transportation. Even transportation. Uh-huh. What about the engine? How many percentage is required? The brain is the engine of the body. So we must understand that the brain is the what? Is the engine of the body. It controls the whole system. How you speak, how you talk, how you laugh, how you walk. It's the brain. It's the what? The brain. And we understand the various work of parts of the brain. So I will not go into details to bring anatomy. But I would just like us to take us through this natural remedies. And the best natural simple treatment is by what? Water. Water is everywhere. And if we use water wisely, many people are not going to get sick. Today many people don't know how much water they should drink a day. How many waters should a person weigh 60 kg drink? How can you understand? How can you know the the water that you should take a day? By doing what? By doing calculation. So I never put it there but we we uh there is the mathematics here that if 1 kilogram is assumed to take 50 ml of water. Therefore, 60 kilm will take how much water? And we understand that 1,00 ml is equal to how many lit? One lit. So, can you calculate 60 * 50 / 1,00 that is 3,00 1,000 is how many lit? 3 L. So if you are 60 kilg how many how much water should you take? It is 3 lit because if 1 kilogram is assumed to be 50 ml. Therefore if you are 50 how many will be that is 50 * 50 that is 2500ide by 1,000 it is 2.5. So calculate and you know you have kilograms and you calculate. What about BMI? BMI. How can we calculate the BMI? It is what to do BMI body mass index. How to know whether you have a lot of cholesterols or you you you fall under normal range because normal range of BMI is 18.5 to 24.9. So if you are below 18.5 gi your you are not you don't have normal BMI. So you need to calculate that one. It is weight. I think it is weight over square or height square over weight. It is weight. Let assume someone is 1.7 cm. You square 1.7 cm. Then you divide with 60 kg 1.7 60 kg let us just do very fast 60 / 1.7 squared no m sorry it is 1 7 m it is no cm Sorry, it is you need to call to time please. It is what? 60 / 1.7 2 1 1.7 * 1.7 you get the answer. Then 10. It seems like some of us never took maths. 2.89 by 60. Yeah. 20.76. So if if such a person was having such height and weight 20.6 that range under normal BMI because it range from 18.5 to 24.9 that is the range of under normal BMI. So if you are above or below the intake of fats should be reduced. But we understand that there are natural fats in the body and now if only we only if people like taking the deep fried foods animal products uh it will bring such a range of high. Let us be back here. The next lesson we will handle water in details how we can use water to cure all the diseases in the body. We have theapy and idotherapy we have steam baths. We have hot food bath. We have hot fermentation among others that we will look into details because those are the kind of simple remedies that are around. Timekeeper will be alerting me if remains 30 minutes. So don't forget to do that. So we have number one we have cabbage. Now these are the simple remedies that we have around. Number one is cabbage. So if you can get a place or somewhere you are writing you can this you can write the benefits of the cabbage. And now what we must understand that fruits, salads and juices those are the best remedies that helps to cleanse the system and even to strengthen the cells of the body. So number one we must understand that juice juices and salad foods are required in the body because they help in removing toxins and even rebuilding some cells which have been destroyed. So number one we have cabbage. I think we can see it there clearly and we have benefits of the cabbage. Number one controls blood pressure. Number two, protects bones from weakening. Number three, promotes good eye health. For those who are having eye problems, they need to fade in mostly in cabbage juices. Sometimes cabbage is sometimes being overcooked until the nutrients required now are not present present. Number three or number four help in weight loss for those who have BMI above 24.9 going upwards. Uh-huh. Number the next is detoxify the body. It removes the toxin from the bodys as blood sugar regulator. Those who are suffering from diabetes, it can help reduces the risk of having ulcer. It is the best remedy by the way for dealing with cancer. We you can make a juice from it. You can make a salad from it. It prevent pimples relieves in constipation. That is a problem someone can have even in a period or in a time that if we don't take a lot of water into the system sometimes we can have constipation improve digestion okay digestion then the next one which is here which is not there it helps in arthritis you can write down I hope you are writing because we have learned that from this place we need to be gospel workers as who know how to combat disease, who know how to prevent disease. So if we will be mentioning and you are not writing sometimes I will be wondering if you will take note later. Uhhuh. Then another one also it it helps in inflammations. For example, we will have a pis from this one and you you can just mash it in hot water. Then you tie it in a inflamed area. We have various inflammation. Inflammation can be in the hands. Inflammation can be in the various parts of the body. Do we understand that if there inflammations in the body, it means there is no better circulation of the blood into the system. Again, it I've said that it helps in the inflammation or inflammatory. It also helps when you are bited with by insects. Insects such as bees, we have worms, wasp among others which is a good remedy for that arthritis. It will deal it will help inflammations among others. You will also add more many more on that. Let us go to let us look another one. This is onion. I hope we understand onion and we know onion very well. Uh onion is one of the one of the medicines that is being that is being used to help in various diseases. We have number one in that other side. Fight cancer, promote respiratory health. If you have asthma, we have various diseases in the respiratory system. It will help low blood sugar levels, enhance eye. It is the best remedy also to use when someone is having an eye problem. You can make a soup from it or you can make a pies from it. And then you tie to the eyes onions and hair growth. It helps in hair growth. It adds some elements that helps in the hair growth. And number one elements that help in the air growth is zinc. So it does it contain various elements such as zinc that also have to maintain black hair and to have good health growth and has brain health. It also helps the brain, prevents inflammation and other allergies. Those who are suffering and having difficulties with allergy, it helps. Rich in antioxidant compounds, contain anti-cancer compounds are antibacterial. There are various bacteria that can affect the body. For example, we have elictor H. pylori which sometimes causes also the ulcers itself. It helps in that we have various bacteras, we have various viruses, we have various what may support heart health, may support bone health to those people who sometimes complain of their bones. It helps it contain also magnesium and calcium because element which is magnesium and calcium they are helping making strong bones. They supply the necessities that are required by wounds to help may support your gut health may regulate blood pressure respiratory system because of time allow me to go a bit faster. Kidogo I use I give the remaining 20 minutes to the class. Okay. at your also on time you can come and have this presentation and you can inquire more books containing the same remedies because sometimes time will not allow us to look them all in details but we will still see on how we will have knowledge on them here we have a spinach how many people know spinach I think we all know spinach very well it helps in preventing cancer keep us relaxed keep our hair nails and skin healthy help us maintain healthy body weight. Rich in protein. If you want protein, obtain it from spinach. Obtain it from nuts. Rich in vitamin C. We know the work of vitamin C. Help us build strong bones. There are some people still complain of the bones. They can feed on stomach. The best is having it as a help us build strong bones. improve digestion, gut health, good for our eyes. It is also a good remedy for eye because it contain vitamin A, regulate blood sugar. These are the same also other uses, boost immunity. Mhm. Helps also the brain, prevent anemia problems. Those who are having anemia, it contains a lot of ions that helps in the blood formation so that your body have the maximum required blood to perform the duties of the system. We have banana. Health benefits of eating a banana. Improve digestion. Improve heart health. Boost energy. Reduce inflammation. Enhance mood. Strengthen the bones. Improve kidney function. Those are the benefits of eating bananas. So we need to take fruits. We need to take nuts and cereals among others that are required in the body. We must understand that if we don't take balanced diet, our body will not get the elements because the elements are very important in the body. Magnesium, calcium, ion, phosphorus, chlorine, they have different bodies. They have different works in the body. So if we don't take in the the body, you will still hear many people complaining because we don't take we don't feed in a balanced diet that we are going to get all these elements all these minerals and all these nutrients that help to build the body. We have watermelon to those who don't doesn't like drinking water. Watermelon also help because it is water than me. So it have a lot of water. Promote heart health. Strengthen the immune system. Improve male fertility. Aids in diabetes treatment. Improve brain health. Enhance digestive health. strengthen hair, improve skin health, slow down aging. Let us look at this one also. This is cayenne pepper and also cayenne pepper. It is the one of the major painillers that is used. Number one, improve circulation. More so when someone is tired it means there is no full circulation in the system. But if you drink if you you drink cayenne if you you it is being used also in the massage to increase the flow of the blood into the system. Uh treat stomach ulcers lower blood pressure. Relieve constipation. Kill garden pest detoxification. Fight cold and flu. Lower blood pressure. Heart conditions. Prevent heart attack. Sen relieve digestive aid. Relieve pain. Toothachenitis wounds fever weight loss headaches congestion. So those are the among the benefits of using these kinds of remedies. Now there is a major remedy here called grapes. In our next lesson we will also look gra in details because grapes it is almost containing all these elements. I can see it has water, energy, protein, carbohydrates, fiber, sugar, calcium, lipids, magnesium, phosphorus among many others. So it is a very good remedy to use to be used while revitalizing the body. When someone the best remedies will the best remedy will be grapes. We will see what we can mix with it to help the body provide to provide the body with the required element. Grapes is a best remedy when using with someone. This one will help him to regain energy faster because it contains all these elements that the body required even that the immune system is required also to rejuvenate the white blood cells. We look that one. We have moringa in this side. We have the benefits of organic moringa. Moringa increase mental clarity. Normalize blood sugar. Increase appetite. Improves wound healing. A wound that has not been healed fast. It is good. Detoxification, anti-casers, ulcers, anti-tumor, antifungal then vision improvement then it is also stimulate the hair growth anti-inflammatory then UTI diseases UT we understand the classification of the UTI they're one of bacter class of I think viruses then contains 92 nutrients 46 antioxidants 36 anti-inflammatories 18 amino acid you will get also time to come so that I send you the the document the document will come to send you the document. So that this time we have one input one two let us start with the questions you can answer. You can start brother Ph. Are you supposed to? Okay, allow me pray first, then I I give the room as we answer the question. Our father in heaven, we thank you for this wonderful lesson. Be with us as the second lesson will be following in Jesus name. Amen. You can stand up and echo your question. 

==================================================

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.3s] lesson on drugs. I will just like us to
[5.2s] read something here that we never read
[7.8s] last time that also was still commenting
[11.0s] on drugs because today many people we
[15.2s] learn that many people have been sick
[19.0s] and they are not getting the right
[21.5s] treatment that they should have. So
[25.0s] today I want us also to look in this
[28.3s] part. Just recently we
[31.6s] had
[33.7s] that help from America. The
[38.0s] American World Health Organization will
[41.4s] not be issuing drugs to Africa. Now this
[45.7s] took many with worry as now many people
[49.6s] who are suffering from HIV
[51.5s] AIDS, malaria, TB among many other
[55.2s] diseases will not now be receiving this
[58.1s] drugs and many people were worried that
[61.2s] with the situation. Uh Kenyans faces HIV
[64.4s] treatment crisis as only 6 months supply
[66.8s] of ARV drugs remaining. So many people
[71.2s] have been worried that when there is no
[73.8s] supply of these drugs, what is the way
[77.1s] forward or what is the solution? We've
[79.6s] learned that we have reached at a time
[81.5s] that we are going to preach these
[83.4s] messages so that people might understand
[85.8s] that there is hope when we believe in
[88.5s] Christ.
[94.3s] uh and many people were worrying how
[97.2s] were they going to help themselves.
[100.5s] So we are being told that the medical
[104.0s] fraternity that is from the book 16 MR
[107.6s] just as I want to connect my lesson from
[110.1s] the point I left under the
[112.9s] drugs right len white writes that the
[116.2s] medical fraternity represented me as
[119.4s] freeman. So we can just highlight that
[122.0s] book and note it down that medical
[125.0s] fraternity of the world it is freemanor.
[129.4s] If we look the logo of health
[133.2s] organization, which logo is that? It is
[136.5s] over
[140.1s] snail. That means that is what a free
[143.6s] man. It
[146.0s] continuates the medical fraternity
[148.4s] presented to me as freman
[151.3s] sorry with their long
[154.1s] unintelligible names which common people
[157.0s] cannot understand. The drugs are having
[159.8s] some names that common people cannot
[162.9s] watch cannot understand. For example,
[166.4s] who can understand what is omerazol?
[169.0s] Omethrosol is a drug that is used in the
[171.9s] cases of alers. Who can understand what
[174.6s] is
[175.3s] omerazol and how it is being
[178.9s] made? We see we cannot understand and we
[181.7s] don't know what are the uh components
[184.3s] that are being used to make that drug.
[187.0s] For example, flagagile. So they are
[190.6s] names even doctor themselves cannot
[193.3s] understand what they are administering
[195.6s] to the people. So what we must
[197.9s] understand that this is a witchcraft and
[200.9s] a sorcery that Satan has brought so many
[204.6s] people might die at earlier age. It
[208.4s] continue
[209.7s] readings cannot understand will call the
[212.5s] Lord's prescription for Ezekiel
[216.8s] quackery. Death was pronounced upon the
[219.3s] king but he prayed for life and his
[222.3s] prayer was heard. Those who are the care
[225.3s] of him were told to get a bunch of figs
[228.6s] and put them on so and the king was
[231.2s] restored. This means was taken by God to
[234.2s] teach them. So in the Bible traces we
[237.9s] are not finding any place that drugs are
[241.6s] are recommended for human treatment. So
[245.4s] what we must understand that we are
[247.5s] living at a time that Satan has studied
[250.6s] the science of the laboratories and now
[254.8s] what Satan is going to do is going to
[257.5s] bring and advertise more chemicals. I
[260.6s] would like us also to read from the book
[262.2s] of great controversy page 559 paragraph
[266.3s] 2 and we we see the plan of Satan with
[270.1s] the drug medication because even now as
[273.0s] the plans of Jesuit disorder if you go
[275.4s] through them they say that they will use
[278.5s] drugs so that they kill people slowly.
[281.4s] What we understand with the
[283.1s] drug will not kill someone within a day
[286.2s] but it is slow and sure killing to the
[288.9s] system. So can we be
[291.2s] there? Satan works through the elements
[294.6s] also to Ghana service of unprepared
[297.1s] souls. He has studied the secrets of the
[300.0s] laboratories of nature. Now being that
[302.7s] Satan is a student of true education, he
[305.1s] has studied the laboratories of nature.
[308.3s] He know the med the remedy that can help
[312.2s] man. But having the knowledge that he
[315.0s] can also make chemicals, he have used it
[318.4s] more than required and he uses all his
[321.7s] power to control the element as far as
[325.4s] God allows. So in these last days, Satan
[328.6s] is controlling the laboratories because
[331.4s] Satan is having an agree project to the
[334.2s] world under medical treatment. So many
[338.7s] people think that when they go to the
[342.0s] hospital it is uh it is that they think
[345.5s] that doctors love them that somehow some
[348.6s] you will find some people saving a
[351.1s] number of doctor a doctor saying Dr. who
[354.2s] and who he has been helping me. You can
[356.9s] also have his number. No, doctors are
[359.2s] not our friends. But they don't love us
[361.8s] but they love our money. Because we know
[364.0s] and understand that the project of
[366.6s] medicine, it is the expensive business
[369.5s] under the world. Why? Because drugs that
[372.6s] are being issued and ministered to the
[374.5s] people, they do not cure diseases. Now
[377.5s] they will make you into in a continual
[380.1s] way that you will you use them daily as
[384.4s] Elder said that it is a fact and true
[388.0s] that it is a
[392.0s] business. So it continues
[395.6s] saying he will favor and prosper some in
[399.3s] order to further his own designs and he
[401.8s] will bring trouble upon others and lead
[404.6s] and lead men to believe that that it is
[407.8s] God who is afflicting them.
[412.6s] Now we understand and as we just read
[416.0s] that this business that is being
[418.8s] conducted by Satan himself through the
[421.8s] many people or through a name called
[425.7s] medicine medicine we know that this is
[427.8s] the sorcery of the papacy. These are the
[431.1s] plans of the papacy that they may
[433.4s] destroy people and kill people in an
[436.1s] earlier age so that people do not make
[438.7s] decisions. In the book of Revelation
[441.4s] chapter 18 verse 23, can someone read?
[445.8s] It says
[448.4s] shall no more. Uh-huh.
[452.2s] Uh-huh.
[456.1s] Shall be heard no more. Uhhuh.
[460.0s] Uh-huh. For thy
[463.4s] merchants were the great men of the
[465.8s] earth today. Who are the great men of
[467.4s] the earth? the merchants, the
[470.6s] businessmen. But what are they selling
[472.6s] to the people? Things that harm the
[475.5s] system and things that kill people's
[477.9s] law. But sure, continue
[480.4s] reading. For by thy
[484.0s] sorceries today, the only is deceived
[487.9s] because the sorcery of the great men who
[491.7s] are deceiving people. So sorcery is full
[494.6s] everywhere. Today even food many foods
[498.1s] that are being made. For example, today
[500.4s] we have plastic cabbages, we have
[503.2s] plastic rice. These are sorceries that
[506.7s] are killing people slowly by
[510.8s] slowly. So that what I wanted to
[513.6s] understand that the project of medicine
[516.9s] it is a project of Satan himself because
[519.7s] it is a sorcery and it is a a
[522.7s] witchcraft. Just Ellen White as he was
[525.3s] shown he have told us that medical
[528.1s] fraternity is what a free m. So what are
[532.6s] the freemasons and what are their
[538.0s] aims? If drug if the drug uh the drug
[542.4s] itself uh the drug company is being
[545.4s] supported with free mans what is the
[550.1s] aim to destroy. So today I would like us
[554.1s] to enter into the solution because we
[558.3s] were looking way forward. We have
[561.0s] learned that the drug is not the way. So
[563.8s] today I would like us to look some
[568.1s] remedies that is going to help our
[571.3s] system and uh this is the point that we
[574.8s] stopped at last time. Someone can echo
[577.5s] it again from the book of
[579.1s] Jeremiah 8 verse 21.
[585.7s] Uhhuh.
[587.7s] Uhhuh. Mhm.
[591.8s] Uhhuh. Why God is that? Because of the
[595.2s] kind of treatment and medication that
[597.4s] people are
[598.8s] pursuing from Satan himself. Verse 22.
[604.2s] It says,
[606.1s] "If there are no is there no bulb in
[608.7s] Gilead?" Is there no bulb in Gilead?
[613.3s] is no is there no physician there?
[619.4s] And that is the question that we asked
[621.3s] last time that is there no physician in
[624.0s] the places we live. Is there no B the
[627.4s] world we are living? But we need to
[629.6s] answer that there is B and thereians
[633.2s] because God has called us to be what? to
[635.6s] be medical missionaries who are going to
[638.3s] understand the cause of diseases and the
[640.9s] medication itself. Let us move forward.
[644.6s] The book of U
[647.6s] PH this is 14 sorry for
[651.9s] 1144
[653.7s] 8.1 I'm just missing for there that
[657.3s] reads the the simple remedies are less
[660.5s] harmful than drug poisons in reion to
[664.2s] their simplicity but in every many cases
[667.3s] these are used when not at all
[670.2s] necessary.
[671.9s] The next paragraph, there are simple
[675.0s] herbs and roots that every family may
[678.6s] use for themselves. So, every family to
[681.3s] use what? Herbs. We are being told that
[684.8s] every family to use what? Herbs. Because
[688.6s] Mhm. Continue reading.
[691.3s] Simple. They are simple herbs.
[695.1s] Pick themselves
[698.8s] call in a physician. Uhhuh. any sooner
[702.5s] than they will call a lawyer. So there
[705.3s] are there are many harms and even roots
[708.5s] that can help so that people might not
[711.0s] be calling physician each and every
[713.1s] time. Today why many people are calling
[716.4s] physicians because they do not
[718.5s] understand how the system how the body
[721.6s] system works. So if you understand how
[724.4s] our body system works, we are not going
[726.6s] to call
[728.0s] manians because we have hs everywhere.
[731.4s] We have roots everywhere. Mhm. The book
[737.8s] of
[739.3s] CME 29 paragraph 4. You can also note
[742.9s] that one. And we see the need of workers
[746.4s] today because after learning that the
[749.0s] drugs are no solution to our life, we
[751.3s] need now to go to the chief physician
[753.4s] who is Christ. Even Christ never
[757.0s] administered drugs to the patients he
[759.5s] attended to. But also Christ gave them
[763.0s] the natural way that God has commanded.
[767.4s] It reads workers workers gospel uh
[771.0s] gospel medical missionaries are needed
[774.0s] now. When are the gospel uh when are the
[777.4s] workers gospel missionaries needed? Now
[780.1s] it is now. Continue. You cannot afford
[782.2s] to spend years in preparation. We can
[784.6s] just not say that we are year after year
[787.7s] we are still preparing to do the work.
[790.3s] Soon doors now open. Soon doors now
[793.8s] open. Soon doors now open. The truth
[796.6s] will be forever closed to the truth will
[798.9s] be forever closed. Carry the message
[801.2s] now. Carry the message now. Not wait.
[803.8s] And not wait. Allow the Do not wait.
[806.7s] Allow the enemy to take possession
[808.7s] Uhhuh. of the fields now open before
[811.6s] you. Continue reading. Let compassy go
[814.2s] forth to do the work to which Christ
[816.6s] appointed his disciples let them labor
[819.4s] as evangelists. Let us now labor as
[821.7s] evangelists. Scattering our
[823.4s] publications. scattering our
[825.0s] publications and talking of the truth to
[827.2s] those they meet. Let them pray for the
[830.0s] sick. Let them pray for the sick.
[832.2s] Ministering to their necessities.
[834.3s] Uh-huh. Not with drugs. Not with drugs.
[837.6s] Not with drugs. Uhhuh. But with nature's
[840.6s] remedies. But with nature's remedy and
[843.1s] teaching them how to regain health and
[845.5s] teaching now people how to regain health
[847.6s] and avoid disease. And avoid disease. So
[851.2s] today we are being called as evangelist.
[853.8s] We are being called as medical
[855.1s] missionary to scatter the publication
[858.2s] that carries the old truth that we
[860.6s] proclaim. Because sometimes in the
[863.5s] message will not be some people may not
[866.2s] have heard the message but through our
[869.6s] publications we will write and we will
[872.2s] publish and people might know what they
[875.4s] must what they must believe or what they
[879.0s] must trust including the first annual
[882.0s] message. The second, the third because
[884.5s] in the third message it carry the
[887.8s] various messages that is the
[890.7s] book CME page 29 paragraph
[894.9s] 4. Then
[899.0s] 90 then ministry of billing page
[904.1s] 147 90 page sorry 90 page 172 paragraph
[908.8s] 4. It reads that let them labor as
[912.8s] evangelists scattering our publication
[915.8s] and taking and talking of the truth to
[919.0s] those they meet. Let them pray for the
[921.4s] sick, ministering to their necessities,
[924.0s] not with drugs, but with nature's remedy
[926.8s] and teaching them how to regain health
[929.0s] and avoid diseases. And that is the
[931.3s] responsibility that Christ has given us
[934.4s] so that we may labor much that people
[937.4s] may live in a way that they cannot be
[941.8s] affected by diseases and give them the
[944.4s] the present truth. Also the book
[948.3s] of medical the book of ministry of
[951.0s] healing page 146 paragraph 1 it reads it
[955.1s] reads
[956.8s] all gospel workers all gospel workers
[959.8s] should know how to give the simple
[961.8s] treatments
[965.6s] all all all yes to mean all if you are a
[968.7s] gospel worker you you are not a medical
[970.8s] missionary are you fulfilling the law
[973.2s] that are you fulfilling the work that
[975.5s] Christ gave but you are being told that
[978.1s] all workers whether you are young or
[981.5s] old we should have a knowledge on how to
[985.2s] give what simple treatments because we
[988.4s] have several simple treatments for
[990.6s] example we have hydrotherapy those are
[994.4s] the kinds of simple treatments that we
[997.0s] can have we have physiootherapy the
[999.4s] massage those are the kind of simple
[1001.6s] treatments that each and every one of us
[1005.0s] have to know. So make sure that after
[1007.6s] coming from this place as a gospel
[1010.5s] worker, you have a eat of giving simple
[1014.7s] treatments that do so much to relieve
[1017.6s] pain and remove disease because soon as
[1021.1s] we have been told that the work of
[1023.3s] gospel work may is going to be closed.
[1026.8s] But if we have knowledge on how to give
[1029.0s] simple treatments that do so much to
[1031.8s] relieve pain and remove diseases many
[1034.6s] many doors are going to be open. Just
[1036.7s] continue reading with the next paragraph
[1038.8s] there. Every disease every every gospel
[1041.8s] worker every gospel worker will feel
[1044.2s] that the giving of instruction uh in the
[1048.1s] principles of healthful living uh is a
[1050.9s] part his appoint is is a part of his
[1055.3s] appointed work. So we have today many
[1057.8s] ministers who are saying that with me
[1060.2s] I'm not a medical missionary I'm just
[1063.0s] I'm I'm just interested in other part
[1065.6s] but we are being told that every gospel
[1068.1s] worker should feel that the giving of
[1071.0s] instruction the principle of healthful
[1072.6s] living is a is a part of it appointed
[1076.2s] work. So each and every individual has
[1078.9s] what? Something to do something to do.
[1082.2s] We cannot just relax that we have the
[1085.0s] the medical missionary department. The
[1087.8s] medical missionary department is not for
[1090.2s] what individual person but it's a call
[1092.7s] to everyone that they should feel and
[1095.8s] understand the responsibility that
[1097.9s] Christ has given them. Continue reading
[1099.6s] it of this work. Uhhuh. There's a great
[1102.6s] need. There is a great need and the
[1105.1s] world is open for it today. Every place
[1108.1s] there is there is no one who is going to
[1110.1s] reject the work of medical missionary
[1112.9s] because everywhere people are sick.
[1115.2s] Everywhere people need the true treating
[1118.6s] of the true method of treating the body.
[1121.8s] That's we have read from the book
[1123.6s] ministry of healing page 147. You can
[1126.6s] also write it down. So we understand
[1129.3s] that each and every person as an
[1132.1s] individual work to have the knowledge in
[1135.6s] simple treatment of disease and
[1137.9s] relieving pain and even removing the
[1140.4s] disease. But as you have learned the
[1142.4s] last time that removing disease we must
[1145.4s] understand the cause and the cause must
[1147.5s] be
[1148.4s] what? The cause must
[1150.8s] be agent. If we understand that method,
[1154.3s] that true method of healing, we are
[1156.6s] going to help many and we are going to
[1158.9s] bring many people to Christ. So this is
[1161.6s] the method and the way that Christ has
[1164.6s] gave that as he sent his disciples to be
[1168.4s] missionaries who will understand the
[1171.6s] necessities of giving the right
[1173.9s] principles of health to people who need
[1177.4s] Christ.
[1178.8s] Today in the book of
[1181.4s] um PH
[1184.7s] PH 1448 paragraph
[1190.2s] 3. It reads it says it says I do not
[1194.2s] think that I can give you any definite
[1196.3s] line of medicine
[1198.4s] compounded and and dealt out by doctors
[1201.9s] that are harm that are perfectly
[1203.7s] harmless. Uh-huh. And yet and yet it
[1206.6s] will not be wisdom to engage in
[1208.8s] controversy. Mhm. Over this subject just
[1212.9s] leave from that point. I think we have
[1214.8s] written it down. We will you will still
[1218.6s] read it later because of time. Let me go
[1221.4s] to another one another quote. That one
[1224.2s] we have look. So after having learned
[1227.3s] that we want to look various simple
[1231.3s] remedies that is going to help us
[1233.9s] because we say that our food should be
[1236.4s] what? Our should our food should be our
[1240.7s] medicine but we should not take medic we
[1243.8s] should not take medicine as what? As
[1246.5s] food. So we want to look various
[1250.8s] remedies that today we have prepared so
[1254.6s] that we might
[1256.9s] understand the time we are
[1260.4s] living. We read that one last time. I
[1263.0s] will not read it again. Now we will read
[1265.4s] from the book medical missionary page
[1267.5s] 320 paragraph 2 and paragraph
[1270.9s] 3. It says it says learn how to combat
[1274.9s] disease. Now that is the major point
[1277.1s] that you need to understand from out
[1278.9s] from this place that you you should know
[1281.9s] how to combat what disease. Know how to
[1285.3s] combat what? Disease. Continue.
[1288.6s] Gather up all the knowledge possible
[1291.7s] that will help to combat disease. So it
[1294.2s] is still your work to do what? To gather
[1297.0s] all knowledge possible that will help to
[1299.5s] combat disease. How are you going to
[1301.6s] gather this knowledge? It is through
[1304.3s] reading various of what books that are
[1307.6s] teaching about health and our hearts. It
[1311.0s] says it says in every place in every
[1313.7s] place the sick may be found. The sick
[1316.0s] may be found and those who go forth as
[1318.2s] workers for Christ those who go forth as
[1320.9s] workers of Christ should be true health
[1323.7s] reformers should be true health
[1325.3s] reformers prepare to give those who are
[1327.4s] seek the simple treatment that will
[1330.2s] relieve them and then pray with them.
[1333.1s] Yeah. Thus they will open the door for
[1335.2s] the entrance of the truth. Uhhuh. The
[1337.4s] doing of this work will be followed by
[1339.4s] good result. Uh-huh. Our Sabbath keeping
[1342.1s] families should keep their mind filled
[1344.2s] with helpful principles of health reform
[1347.0s] and other lines of truth that they may
[1349.5s] be a help to their neighbors. Amen. Be
[1352.3s] practical missionaries. So what is
[1354.6s] needed for us now the time of living
[1356.8s] that we be what? Practical missionaries.
[1359.0s] Practical missionaries. Gather up all
[1361.8s] knowledge possible that will help to
[1364.2s] combat disease. Amen. This
[1368.0s] just that point also read HL page 19
[1372.2s] paragraph
[1374.1s] 5 HL. It is the duty of every person to
[1378.0s] become intelligent in regard to disease
[1380.4s] and it causes. So we have a work to do
[1383.8s] to become intelligent in regard to
[1386.3s] disease and it causes and that is the
[1388.9s] great work that each and every person
[1392.1s] need to
[1393.8s] do. Mhm.
[1399.3s] Yeah, just again in the book of WM page
[1404.1s] 127 paragraph one it says it says God's
[1408.2s] people God's people should know how to
[1410.8s] give the simple treatments Uhhuh. that
[1413.4s] do much to relieve pain. Uhhuh. And to
[1416.5s] remove diseases and to remove disaseshu
[1421.1s] eggs and pains Uhhuh. have left you
[1423.5s] without the use of medicine.
[1426.4s] What is the definition of disease? What
[1428.5s] is the definition of disease? Disease is
[1430.2s] an effort of nature to free the system
[1432.6s] from conditions. Mhm. That result from a
[1435.5s] violation of the laws of health. So I
[1438.2s] think that foundation that I have built,
[1440.5s] it is enough for us to have knowledge in
[1443.7s] combating diseases and even relieving
[1446.4s] pain in using some simple remedies. And
[1449.1s] now one of the simple remedies that we
[1451.3s] will like and start off is some of kind
[1453.8s] of foods is kind of food that many
[1456.6s] people know and many people use. So the
[1460.8s] best natural remedies that we should
[1463.1s] know it is keeping the commandments of
[1466.4s] God and eight laws of health. Why?
[1469.6s] Because number one, we understand that
[1471.7s] if we go against law number four that
[1475.1s] speak about
[1476.7s] water and we if we go against law number
[1479.7s] four, we know very well that a lot of
[1482.8s] water is required into the system.
[1485.2s] Number one, who knows the work of the
[1487.8s] water in the system into the system.
[1490.7s] Number one, we have various work of
[1492.7s] water in the body. Number
[1496.6s] one, gas exchange. Number two,
[1502.2s] uh, number three,
[1506.7s] we don't know the uses of water in the
[1508.5s] body. Digestion. What helps to cool the
[1511.2s] system? Digestion.
[1513.7s] Digestion. Another
[1515.8s] one. What about the body? Even
[1519.0s] transportation. Even
[1521.2s] transportation. Uh-huh. What about the
[1524.3s] engine? How many percentage is required?
[1529.4s] The brain is the engine of the body. So
[1531.8s] we must understand that the brain is the
[1533.4s] what? Is the engine of the body. It
[1536.1s] controls the whole system. How you
[1538.3s] speak, how you talk, how you laugh, how
[1541.0s] you walk. It's the brain. It's the what?
[1543.0s] The brain. And we understand the various
[1546.1s] work of parts of the brain. So I will
[1548.8s] not go into details to bring anatomy.
[1551.8s] But I would just like us to take us
[1553.3s] through this natural remedies. And the
[1555.6s] best natural simple treatment is by
[1557.6s] what? Water. Water is everywhere. And if
[1561.5s] we use water wisely, many people are not
[1564.0s] going to get sick. Today many people
[1568.1s] don't know how much water they should
[1570.0s] drink a
[1571.4s] day. How many waters should a person
[1576.2s] weigh 60 kg
[1579.6s] drink? How can you understand? How can
[1582.2s] you know the the water that you should
[1585.0s] take a
[1587.3s] day? By doing
[1590.4s] what? By doing calculation. So I never
[1595.1s] put it there but we we uh there is the
[1599.9s] mathematics here that
[1602.6s] if 1
[1604.8s] kilogram is assumed to take 50 ml of
[1608.2s] water. Therefore, 60 kilm will take how
[1612.8s] much water? And we understand that 1,00
[1615.7s] ml is equal to how many lit? One lit.
[1619.4s] So, can you
[1621.6s] calculate 60 * 50 / 1,00 that is
[1627.9s] 3,00 1,000 is how many lit? 3 L. So if
[1633.5s] you are 60 kilg how many how much water
[1638.2s] should you take? It is 3 lit because
[1642.8s] if 1 kilogram is assumed to be 50 ml.
[1648.0s] Therefore if you are 50 how many will be
[1651.5s] that is 50 * 50 that is 2500ide by 1,000
[1657.5s] it is 2.5. So calculate and you know you
[1661.6s] have kilograms and you calculate. What
[1664.2s] about
[1668.0s] BMI? BMI. How can we calculate the
[1672.8s] BMI? It is
[1677.2s] what to do BMI body mass index. How to
[1682.1s] know whether you have a lot of
[1683.6s] cholesterols or you you you fall under
[1687.0s] normal range because normal range of BMI
[1690.0s] is
[1690.8s] 18.5 to
[1692.6s] 24.9. So if you are below 18.5
[1697.0s] gi
[1700.7s] your you are not you don't have normal
[1703.4s] BMI. So you need to calculate that one.
[1705.5s] It is weight. I think it is weight over
[1708.1s] square or height square over
[1711.4s] weight. It is
[1724.0s] weight. Let assume someone is 1.7 cm.
[1728.2s] You square 1.7 cm. Then you divide with
[1735.1s] 60
[1738.8s] kg 1.7 60
[1741.6s] kg let us just do very
[1746.4s] fast 60 / 1.7
[1753.6s] squared no m sorry it is 1 7 m it is no
[1758.7s] cm
[1760.8s] Sorry, it is you need to call
[1766.2s] to time
[1776.6s] please. It is what?
[1781.5s] 60 / 1.7
[1785.4s] 2 1 1.7 * 1.7 you get the answer.
[1794.0s] Then
[1807.7s] 10. It seems like some of us never took
[1816.7s] maths.
[1823.2s] 2.89 by
[1826.2s] 60. Yeah.
[1832.5s] 20.76. So if if such a person was having
[1837.4s] such height and weight 20.6 that range
[1841.1s] under normal BMI because it range from
[1844.8s] 18.5 to
[1848.0s] 24.9 that is the range of under normal
[1851.2s] BMI. So if you are above or below the
[1854.6s] intake of fats should be reduced. But we
[1858.1s] understand that there are natural fats
[1859.8s] in the body and now if only we only if
[1864.5s] people like taking the deep fried foods
[1867.0s] animal products uh it will bring such a
[1870.2s] range of high. Let us be back here. The
[1874.6s] next lesson we will handle water in
[1876.3s] details how we can use water to cure all
[1879.7s] the diseases in the body. We have theapy
[1883.1s] and idotherapy we have steam baths. We
[1885.4s] have hot food bath. We have hot
[1887.9s] fermentation among others that we will
[1889.8s] look into details because those are the
[1891.9s] kind of simple remedies that are around.
[1894.7s] Timekeeper will be alerting me if
[1896.7s] remains 30 minutes. So don't forget to
[1900.2s] do
[1901.2s] that. So we have number one we have
[1904.4s] cabbage. Now these are the simple
[1906.5s] remedies that we have around. Number one
[1909.8s] is cabbage. So if you can get a place or
[1913.0s] somewhere you are writing you can this
[1915.4s] you can write the benefits of the
[1917.2s] cabbage. And now what we must understand
[1920.5s] that
[1921.9s] fruits, salads and juices those are the
[1925.7s] best remedies that helps to cleanse the
[1928.6s] system and even to strengthen the cells
[1930.9s] of the body. So number one we must
[1933.4s] understand that juice juices and salad
[1937.3s] foods are required in the body because
[1940.4s] they help in removing toxins and even
[1943.4s] rebuilding some cells which have been
[1945.7s] destroyed. So number one we have
[1947.7s] cabbage. I think we can see it there
[1951.2s] clearly and we have benefits of the
[1955.6s] cabbage. Number one controls blood
[1959.8s] pressure. Number two, protects bones
[1963.1s] from
[1964.4s] weakening. Number three, promotes good
[1967.6s] eye health. For those who are having eye
[1969.7s] problems, they need to fade in mostly in
[1973.7s] cabbage
[1977.7s] juices. Sometimes cabbage is sometimes
[1981.2s] being overcooked until the nutrients
[1983.6s] required now are not present present.
[1987.0s] Number three or number four help in
[1989.4s] weight loss for those who have BMI above
[1994.3s] 24.9 going
[1996.4s] upwards. Uh-huh. Number the next is
[2000.2s] detoxify the body. It removes the toxin
[2003.4s] from the
[2006.2s] bodys as blood sugar regulator. Those
[2009.2s] who are suffering from diabetes, it can
[2011.5s] help reduces the risk of having ulcer.
[2015.0s] It is the best remedy by the way for
[2017.1s] dealing with
[2019.2s] cancer. We you can make a juice from it.
[2023.3s] You can make a salad from it. It
[2028.2s] prevent
[2032.4s] pimples relieves in
[2035.2s] constipation. That is a problem someone
[2038.8s] can have even in a period or in a time
[2042.3s] that if we don't take a lot of water
[2044.1s] into the system sometimes we can have
[2047.6s] constipation improve
[2050.3s] digestion okay digestion then the next
[2053.8s] one which is here which is not there it
[2057.4s] helps in arthritis you can write down I
[2060.7s] hope you are writing because we have
[2063.4s] learned that from this place we need to
[2065.0s] be gospel workers as who know how to
[2067.4s] combat
[2068.4s] disease, who know how to prevent
[2071.4s] disease. So if we will be mentioning and
[2073.7s] you are not writing sometimes I will be
[2075.9s] wondering if you will take note later.
[2079.0s] Uhhuh. Then another one also it it helps
[2082.8s] in inflammations. For
[2086.9s] example, we will have a pis from this

[2094.5s] water. Then you tie it in a inflamed
[2098.4s] area. We have various inflammation.
[2100.9s] Inflammation can be in the hands.
[2103.2s] Inflammation can be in the various parts
[2105.2s] of the body. Do we understand that if
[2108.2s] there inflammations in the body, it
[2110.7s] means there is no better circulation of
[2112.4s] the blood into the system. Again, it
[2116.8s] I've said that it helps in the
[2118.8s] inflammation or inflammatory.
[2122.2s] It also helps when you are bited with by

[2315.2s] details but we will
[2318.0s] still see on how we will have knowledge
[2321.0s] on them here we have a spinach how many

[2543.3s] painillers that is
[2545.9s] used. Number one, improve circulation.
[2550.9s] More so when someone is tired it
[2554.4s] means there is no full circulation in
[2557.2s] the
[2558.0s] system. But if you drink if you you
[2561.2s] drink cayenne if you you it is being
[2564.6s] used also in the

[2607.6s] among the benefits of using these kinds
[2611.4s] of remedies. Now there is a major remedy
[2614.2s] here called
[2616.4s] grapes. In our next lesson we will also
[2619.1s] look gra in details because grapes it is
[2623.2s] almost containing all these elements. I
[2625.8s] can see it has water, energy, protein,
[2628.9s] carbohydrates, fiber, sugar, calcium,
[2632.7s] lipids, magnesium, phosphorus among many
[2636.2s] others. So it is a very good remedy to
