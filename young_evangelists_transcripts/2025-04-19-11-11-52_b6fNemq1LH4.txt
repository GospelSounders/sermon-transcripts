FULL TRANSCRIPT:
According to the book of 1 Corinthians, he is telling us that no man can lay no other foundation than that which was laid by Christ. And when Christ was calling the Millerite movement that the birth of the Remnant church must be established, he he tried step by step for the advancement of this truth. And when the church apostiated and we separated ourself that we may come and establish this church, when you have come and establish this church, it means that we are not establishing another foundation. But we are uh we want to build the foundation that were laid by Christ, that were laid by the prophets and that were laid by the pioneers of the church. Praise God. Are you getting me up to that point? So we want to discuss a topic called ordination and credential. And before I do anything I want to can you write ordination. What is the meaning of ordination? Go with me in Noah dictionary ordination. Can you first come you tell me I read on my own ordination. You write the meaning of ordination. ministers, elders and judge members. I want you to be keen and I don't want to see any elder not writing. Kindly, you may forgive me on that, but kindly write. Kindly, please write ordination. You write give me the meaning of ordination. I want you to read with me. The state of being ordained or appointed establish order or tendency consequent of an decree. Number two, virtue always vice have natural relation to the happiness and mystery of life representative. Let me just proceed. Let me run with you in number three. in the priest priestbyarian and congregational church. The act of settling or establishing a license clergy man over a church and congregational with pastoral charge and authority. Also the act of conferring on a clergy the powers of a minister of the gospel without the charge or oversight of a particular church. or a particular church but with general powers of an evangelist who is authorized to form churches and administer the sacramental of baptism and the Lord's supper where he may be called to officiate I want you to mark the last words the first statement is saying that the state of being ordained or appointed it means that ordination for you to be ordained First you must be appointed. That is number one. The second one when you are ordained an evangelist or an elder first you have to consider that what is your biggest work to do sacramentals to do baptism and to do the Lord's supper. Praise God. It means that we have to be ordained ordination must be in the church of God. Number two, give me credential. Credential. Then I try to tell you one thing. [Music] Credential. Credential. Yes. Credential. Because the reason why we try to investigate this thing because when we are looking for the advent movement, we look for the year 1861 when this church was being established when uh because in 1860 as we know the seventh the saparian adventist was given the name 7th day adventist and as we proceed in the year 1861 the first conference which was organized was the mystigan conference and when mystigan conference was organiz organized. First they try to elect the chairman and they try to elect CL cla and after that there is first step of organization when you want to flee to the gospel order first we have to come to the organization but there's first step when we want to say that this body has been organized this first step that we got to follow can we read credential you have been told that that which give credit. Write that. That which gives credit, that which give a title or a claim to confidence, the warrant on which belief, credit or authorities claimed among strangers as the letters of commendation and power given by a government or ambassador or envoy which give him credit at a foreign court. So the powers of working miracles given to apostles may be considered as their credentials. authority to them to propagate the gospel and entitling them to credit. First word credential is that which give a credit. It means that when I have my credential, it means that I have been given a credit by this organization to go and propagate this thing. Are we okay? When I am in uncertain circle, I can been given a credit. I can been given a pro a water credential. Then when I go to another company which we are working with but not here in Kenya maybe in America I can show my credential they say ah you are our own we are in one organization we are in one circle to do this work. Are we okay? So why credential? Because there's something that tendency that has come to this church that was in seventh adventist church that when the church when we want to put this church in order in every way people there has been two what two mind that when we organize our church will come Babylon do people have those minds that when I organize I will lose my son give me the value when we organize that many people fear that when I organize I'm going to lose my influence. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. But before we organize, we must know that the first step of organization is ordination and credential. Ordination and credential. Go with me in the book of one bio. The book of one bio. The book of one by page 455. 455 paragraph number three. You hear first when the Mexican conference was organized because we have to know that 7th adventure general was organized in the year 1863 but Michigan conference was organized in the year 1861. So when the Mexican conference was organized what was the first step which was being taken? Read with me. It reads, it reads, "Resolved that our minister papers consist of a certificate of orination." That it was resolved. Our minister's papers consist of certificate of ordination. First, the papers of ministers must consist of one, the certificate of coordination. Coordination. Let me ask you, can I have a certificate of coordination before reaching that coordination? for certificate. It means that someone being he must be scrutinized. His ways must be first investigated before being ordained. So fast they told that it was in that it was in par that that our minister's papers consist of certain valition also credentials to be signed by chairman and of the conference. So right the first step of coronation before writing that can you read a 18 a 18 uh act of apostle 18 act of apostle page 18 it reads it reads it was at the ordination of the 12 it was at the ordination of the 12 that the pastor step was taken in the organization of the church that the first step was taken in the ordination of the of the church. So when we want to call ourselves that we have organized into one body, what should we do? Ordination. Ordination. Praise God. Amen. That a church be without ordination without redemption. It is not organized. It is going to be praise God. [Music] Because the Christ has given was that go and bring the gospel baptizing them in the name of the father the son and the of the holy spirit in you. So it means that you cannot preach and bring people to church without baptizing them and without being bapt without baptizing someone it means that you must be ordained. So the first step of organizing church is doing what is called ordination. Are we clear at that point? So when we are in ordination is being given a credit to offer sacmental services the Lord that is number one mark that so let us go one by so when I I am being given credentials what should be done first a credential is being given to ministers there are credential can be given to ministers who are being ordained there are also Credential that can be given ministers to do to preach the gospel. Preach the gospel. Credential is what is called lense. Because we know the other day that in the year 1833 Miller was given license. But when did Miller started preaching? Yes. 1831. And he was licensed in which year? It means that I cannot just enter the gospel today and I am being given the credential today. Are we sure at that point I cannot enter the ministry to do the gospel work today and in this day or in this year being given a credential it cannot work. It is confusion and below that a credential should be signed by the chairman and the cler of the conference. That is number one. Number two that which credential shall be renewed annually? This credential shall be renewed annually. annually. Praise God. So it means that when I been given a credential in the next year this credential should be renewed that is they shall be renewed annually. So the question it means that if given a credential has been he has not been faithful in this work in the next year can he but let me ask you if I have been in this church and in the next church or in the next should I be ordained again should be ordained And then no. C O D 173. C O D 173. C O D 173. 171 not 1731 paragraph is paragraph number seven. Verse 21 paragraph 7. It reads paragraph 7. Paragraph 7 reads. If a person who has been ordained to the ministry, if a person who had been to the ministry on account of ma fails to have his credential renewed by the conference who fails to have it credential renewed to the conference is he in that condition authorized to baptize? Is he in that condition authorized to baptize to officiate at communion to officiate at communion and perform the marriage ceremony? to the point of according to the question number one he has to he can baptize he can baptize it mean that someone who is not being ordained cannot baptize that is number one the holy communion and communion can women be ordained it means that they can officiate holy communion thank you Number three, they cannot perform a marriage ceremony. Number three, they cannot perform marriage means an elder who not can perform a marriage ceremony. Go with me in 173. It is 173 paragraph number four. It reads, it reads, "Would it be proper for one who has been ordained as an elder of a local church 173. Yes. Read now. Would it be proper for one who has been ordained Will it be proper for one who has been ordained as an elder of a local church of an elder of a local church but has not been reelected but has not been reelected in that church to take the lead in the breaking of bread? Can he lead in the breaking of the bread on baptism? That is a question. What is the answer? If he has been ordained as an elder church, if an elder has been ordained as an elder of this church and has been faithful in church duties, if that has been church duty although we moved to another church again, it might be for him to officiate request by the church. Amen. Can you again? It means that he has to lose his credential and before he can read again he must be scrutinized again that anger canain also ministers can be okay to be what should be P A P A N The time is there for you. Prepare your questions. I'm almost ending. PM PM from a trip I'm sure before ordination I'm not going to start topic min ordination paragraph paragraph number one ordination in the is the church's public recognition of divine Because this by the laying on of hands the church authorizes minister to teach the church authorize the church the church authorizes ministers to teach that is number one baptize to baptize and organize churches and organize churches. So who has been given to organize churches? The ministries. Who? The ministries. Ministers. And if a minister has been ored, how many works can you do? Then he can teach. Number two, baptized. Number three. Praise God. Amen. So after that acts 13:1 before being sent forth it says before being sent forth as missionary to the heist ministers it say but before being sent forth as missionary these apostles were solely dedicated to God these apostles were solely dedicated to God by fasting by prayer and by two prayer and the laying on of hands and number three by coordination. has been authorized by the church. They must be authorized by the church. Not only to teach the not only if you are not only to teach the truth but to perform the rights of baptism but to perform the rights of baptism and to organize churches number two to organize churches being invested fullical authority to teach the truth to baptize and organize churches. So before baptize you must be that your ordination must be authorized by the church. I can hear. Thank you. Number two reads before the nation and ministers write this that beforeation miners should give evidence that they have dedicated themselves the work should give their obligation that they dedicated their works to themselves the work. So if that minister is lagging here to here to here and dedicate yourself to God can dedicated his word to God but to God. There must be evidence on the part of those who take the song position of the shepherds that they have without reservation to be given themselves to the word. You must dedicate yourself first to the work of God. They must take Christ as their personal savior. They must take Christ as their personal savior. Hands laid upon men to ordain them for the ministry before they are thoroughly examined. Hands are laid upon them to the ministry before they are thoroughly examined as to their qualification for the sacred. But how much better would it be to make work before accepting them as ministers? But how much better would it be to make thorough work before accepting them as ministers than to have to go through this rigid examination? That to have to go through this rig examination become established in their position. Yes. And I'm not it must be scrutinized. Number one. Second item. There are two things in the ministry of God and the work of God. They are only licensed ministers and they are also ordained minister. I can be licensed as minister or I can be given a credential as a minister but I cannot baptist. I wish I get at that point. I can be licensed and I will bring the truth but I cannot do what you baptist. I cannot be baptized. Can you do one bio page 2 bio 173 biome 173 173 The paragraph is paragraph number one. Can you hear me? In the year 1867, what has happened? And I give you the age of baptism that has been in the 173 number one. The statistical report of the conference session list 28 today ministers say the statistical report of the conference session. This is the statistical report on the conference side in the year 1867 listed 28 ordained ministers. How many ordained ministers? 28 ordained ministers. 10 licensed minister. 10 licensed ministers. 4320. Praise God. Amen. It means that I can be I can be lined. It means that not every ministers can do can do baptism can do lot marriage also also marriage praise God ministers let any minister define just baptizing and holding or if you are not being also in this work you will lose your predation and your ordination. So the church must ple into gospel order that these doors that the devils let in should be closed. So let me give some of the examples of the ericated miners. You write the year it was in the year 1854. You write ADVP page 14 ADVP Adventist Bion and Pictures Page 14.2 age because some may say that what age they receive one of this example two number two it says it says John not became a Sabbathke keeping Adventist he became a Sabbathke keeping Adventist through the labor of John Neon Andrews of John Neon Andrews began preaching immediately and was obeyed in 1854 began preaching immediately. He became a he says he became preaching. He began preaching immediately. He began preaching immediately. I was obeying in the year 1854. Can you he was in which year? 1854. 1854. At which year? Go to the last words. It says when he was only 22 years old. Can you stud it say was the first man to receive was the first man to receive and who was later to be known as the seventh day child this when he was only 22 years only 22 years old it means that a minister of 22 years old andained if he has been faithful in his work praise God amen when he was 32 years You can read with me page 98.5 page 98 number 598 number five 989 John Lboro Mhm. Huh? Page 98. 98. Yes. Number five. Two by page 98. The paragraph is paragraph number five. It reads 98 paragraph 5. Yes. Go and James. Can you if you can stress where Smith was 32 years? Uh how it says says the motion carried Smith was 32 years of age. Smith was 32 years of age. I have just the day before been ordained to the ministry. The ministry at which 32 years old are clear at that point the young can be ordained the alo can be done what can be ordained. So it means that we want to make a point of guidance we have given authority to that day. The reason I have shown you brother John was because the although this church in the year 1854 has not had a strong organization but they had strong leadership. No one could be recklessly allowed to or baptize before. So it means that when you guys are being ordained is considered. Can you read this book 360? You can write on choosing leadership or coordination with six. 360 it reads it says continu has done not bear the balance he had he has had to bear in keeping things together let's work with him and sustain him yes brother MG Kellogg has done what he could brother MG Kellogg has done what he could he has an excellent spirit and he has an excellent spirit no No one has the word of tot. in spirit. No one has a word to find with him to find with him. If it means that church members have been calling and I ask you is there anyone with international then someone can I have a then he is being found disgra it says he is conscious he is cautious very timid and selfish and selfish consensious consensious and devoted to the world and devoted to the world but become not be discouraged if the labor he puts forth will not see result in immediate good. Great. He was ordained at the camp meeting. He was ordained at the meeting and this will be a courage and strength to him. And this will be a courage and strength to him. His wife is a thoroughly converted woman. Unite before his wife must be what? Thorally converted. A thoroughly converted woman. Woman. Praise God. that is is not converted. He's not even as Adventist. Can I because my wife is unconverted? She has upon accountance expression of contentment and peace to the immediate surrounding. It means that also my wife must be considered if he's really is she really converted? Is she really converted? Going to the next one. Next paragraph. TD O in the blue estate. TD in the blue state to give you time that you may add or you may ask your questions. TD the doctrine of Christ. So 2 to8 one says 2 to8. Can I give another migraine? [Music] It says it says the officers of the church recognize the New Testament. The church recognizing the New Testament are bishops are bishops or elders or elders and deacons. Bishops, elder and deacons. Because as stated in Philippians 1 verse number one go to the next one says the terms bishop the terms bishop and elder an elder defining office of the church defining the bishop's church are used synonymously so an elder also can be called bishop you write Titus 1 vers 5 to 7 go to the next one according to the record found in the new testament according to the reports found in the new testament the elders were appointed by the apostles The elders were appointed by the apostles or some are designated by them.

The end of the church at Jerusalem. The sed Jerusalem. Sat with the apostle in the past council. Sat with the apostle in the past council. And the decision made then was sent out in the joint name of the apostles and elders. Go to the next one. [Music] Save the inspire apostle. saying the inspired lay hands suddenly on a onlay hand upon a certain man in in some of our churches in some of our churches in this seventh adventist church organizing and ordaining elders has been premature the organizing and has been really premature rule has been disregarded rule has been disregarded consequently stable has been brought upon the church there will not be so great haste in electing leaders. There are so leaders as to ordain men who are in no way fitted for the respons but they are really unfitted with the work of we should have noticed but God has us to follow the order of men who need to be converted men who need to be converted elevated and noble and noble refined refined before they can serve the cause of God in any capacity to be converted. If I was having on some 12 years with this church, but has been I have not been really converted. I should the church will not take time to read them. Let gather both good and bad. It takes time for to be developed. There must be time to learn what men really are. The next one, the family of the one suggested for office should be considered. The family of all shall be considered family. The family shall be considered. Are they in subjection? Are they in subsp are his children? The children are not converted. when it is the right of this church because they are qualified. It means that when you hear this that when my child is going to the institution the man is going to revote the the parents are going to receive the mark of the why because he's the head of the church also when an elder has been put at the head of the church and his child is going to the institution it means that the early church is going to receive the mark of beast Thank you my brother. It means that should not even be connected with the institution of the beast. Are you judgment? If your effort is on the other side, you walk to the on the other side and you also can you ask an elder of the church it means that he belongs to that city. If it's not a church member, can it be can we take elders from church to be an of this church? Can it be possible? It means that you can take an effort on that is not a church member. It means that the reason of me should be renewed to that again. He can be ordained. But if not, you cannot be without it. Will they do to the father's influence? To the father's influence. So it means that my child has not honored me in my house. If he has not tacked it not tacked wisdom or power of holiness at home in the managing his house it is safe to conclude that the same defect will be carried to the church. It is said that the same defect will be carried to the into the church. That's fine. These churches are our churches are good. Our churches are blind. Why? I can say church is blind because the church is not because of the church of blindness. Even the church will be blind. We not going to receive eternity. with the blind child. It says if he has not tal power goodness at home in managing his own family it is safe to conclude that the same defects will be carried into the church and the same unsanctified management will be seen there. It will be far better to criticize the man. It will be far better to criticize the man before he is put into office. You must be criticized before being put into an office. After what? But then after better to pray and cancel before the taking decisive step. To pray and cancel before taking into that office than to labor to correct the consequence of a wrong move. [Music] 2 31 316 316 I want to give you time 316. The paragraph is paragraph number one. It says it says sister as your husband might be some might be of some use in the church. Kindly save [Music] me. Okay. Okay. And you kind of your hand kindly. Should I call you by name? Sister S. Your husband might be of some use in the church. Indeed. Your husband is converted. When your husband start to pres your husband has strength and he has strength. Sister S. Sister, your husband might be of some use in the church. Of some use to the church. If your influence or what it ought to be, if your influence is what it should ought to to be. But influence your influence is by now. It cannot be of use to the church. But example and influence example and influence disqualifies him to exert a sanctifying influence in the church. Disqualify him. again. No. No. Says it says home influence more than more than counteract his effort for good. More than counteract for good. You are holy and qualified to be the wife of an elder to be a wife of elder of the child. Your husband is disqualified and is disqualified to be an elder. You are really disqualified, unquestim It says your husband has a work to do to set his heart and house in order to set his house and heart in order. When he is converted that will be converted then he can strengthen his brother then he can come and strengthen the church. So just stay away. We need not your help before being converted. But after conversion come and we we need your influence but before we need you. Praise God. Are we clear? So how many of you have been baptized by elders? Means that I am an elder before I cannot baptize. So a question I was going to give you. You read with me 1. 1 48 1 It says matters for conference consideration says that is paragraph five. The paragraph is paragraph number five. The ministry this conference session said Paul you can tap your name. Thank you for that. Now it says the minister of this conference session we want to establish this church in the exist. Is that your will? It is also my will. If it is our will then let us agree to what our pioneers agreed read. It reads, it reads the minutes of this conference session, the many minutes of this conference session support some interesting items of business interesting items for business. Mhm. From Wisconsin. Yes. Calling for the opinion of the conference. How shall we treat divorced marriages? There has been this chart. This chart has a lot of problem. Are we okay? This church really has a lot of problem. The question is number one, how shall we treat divorce? What divorce marriages? Number two, shall preachers from other denominations embracing the message preach and baptized among us on the strength of their former relation standing as ministers? It says it says shall preachers from other denomination shall preachers from other denominations embracing the message embracing the message preach and baptize among us if I am from another denomination but I am embracing this message shall I preach and baptize preach and baptize preach and baptize in the strength of their form ordination and standing and missing standing as ministers. Let me say that brother organization another denomination but he was can I preach again? That is a question I don't want you to answer. The third question it says it says shall young preachers shall young preachers before being ordained before being be allowed to baptize be allowed to baptize shall and young preachers before being shall me allow baptizaptions after satisfying themselves the full intent of the first Christian yes and asserting that that that who is involved Yes. Was accepting into judge membership those couples. Yes. Comprising of individuals who have been divorced resolved that the matter of divorce marriage be referred to the conference committee. I'm going to discuss the matter of divorce marriages. But divorce marriage in a church. It should be referred to the conference committee. It says true. It should be referred to the conference committee. Not any minister elder found in the church following the wizard let him be referred to what the government committee was that solution number two solve number two what was the question that ministers other denominations go to the question number two question number two this ministers evangelist shall preachers from other denominations shall preachers from other denominations preaching the message the message this message of one true God preach and baptize among us should preach and baptize among us on the strength of theiration on the strength of theordination understanding as ministers should we come and stand that I am a minister of this because I believe this truth this is all that ministers of other denominations some of present truth Please should give proofs of being called to preach the message. They should first give proof of being called to what? To preach the message. Yes. And be ordained among us. Then they should first give truth for years. Number two, they must be doing what again? Ordained among us. They must be be ordained among us once more. Before administering the ordinance. Before administering the ordinances. How many denomination do you know? We know what its [Music] [Music] name association of sevenist The International Association of the Holy Bible as God's infallible word strongly believes in all its principles, doctrines, teachings. This modified list of fundamental beliefs does not represent all the beliefs of the Bible. Yes. For a specific creed espoused by this association. The following are the fundamental doctrines. So the governoring and environment appelled by this oition they held by the free all its members churches and ministries church member if you are a minister on that what that under that umbrella you must believe this the true and the living God true and the living God the first person of the godheaded is the first person of God is our holy father oh Jesus Christ the second person of the godheaded the second person for the Godhead. Number three, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Godhead, the third person of the Godhead is Christ representative on earth. and lead sinners to repentance and obvious God's command and is the same they general can sort movement within SD deep beliefs that I don't believe also fundamental scroll up when we read that red page red page red page uh the fundamental Christian belief of 7day advent movement letter [Music] letter seven advent Christian believes on seventh day seventh day Adventist reformed movement to the content we read the content of this book if you have time you can come and read Number the godhead. The godhead. Praise God. I don't know that because it say number one is the the godhead the father the father the son the son see the holy spirit is the holy spirit I don't want to are they different shall they be allowed to baptize among us shall elders who have not been ordained allowed to baptize among I don't want to read that. Number three. Question number three. Number three. Yes. It reads, "Shall young preachers shall young preachers for being ordained before young preachers being ordained be allowed be allowed to baptize resolved. It was resolved that no person omega that no person young or old an evangelist young or an old elder should administer ordinances before being obeyed should not administer ordinances ordinances baptism and lots it means an elder who has not been ordained should not be allowed to baptize Yes. Praise God. It means that if you are baptized by what baptized by an elder who has not been obeyed, you have to be rebaptized again. If you baptized by an elder who has not believed in, you have to be baptized. And I know you know what the message means. You read me SP1.5 as you prepare your question. SPN reads it reads I saw the nominal chart page two SPM 3.8.8 It says it. So those who have been drawing the churches just read says it say I saw those who have been baptized as the churches. I saw that those who have been baptized as going into the churches have to be baptized again as the faith. They have to be baptized again into the door or they go missing. Those who have not been baptized since 1844. Those who have not been baptized since 1844. You have to be before Jesus come. You have to be baptized before Jesus comes. This church will not progress. The reason why our publishing house is not working. Ministers are converted. Elders are unconverted. The church members you are not able to pro. Why? Because you are not being baptized. You have been baptized by someone who does not allow the message. If I could have time, we could read over and after I know you know what the third angel's message is. After the third angel's message, you have to be rebaptized again. After learning the Sabbath message, you have to be rebaptized again. Let me conclude at that point. Can you read? Then I saw those who stand making up the bridge and standing in the former sees 184 written the commandments and so follow the yes as the first day instead of the seven. Yes. See the light shown out of the Muslim. Yes. Given up the institutions of the pop. Are you understanding? [Music] It reads, can you kindly understand this kindly? It reads, it reads, "The night I saw those whose hands are engaged in making up the bridge, the night I saw that those whose hand are engaged in making up the bridge and are standing in the gap and are standing in the gap that are formerally since 1844 formerally since 1844 broken the commandments. The commandment way of eating marri as to keep the first day instead of the seven. You want to keep the first day instead of the and you have seen the light shone out of the most holy place. See the light sh out of the most holy place. Change their course. You must change your course even at the institution of the poor. You will leave the institution of the word for the pop and are keeping God's Sabbath would have to go down into the water. You have to go down into the waters and be baptized in the faith of the sanctuary and be baptized in the faith of the sanctuary and keep the commandment of God and the faith of Jesus. Praise God. Amen. If you are baptized and you have gone back to the institution of the beast, Babylonian institutions, you have to be rebaptized again. How many have gone to the institution of the beast after being baptized? How many have been baptized by the elders in the institutions of the beast? You have to go down into the water again. But you cannot go down to the you will not have any progress. there will be no progress in you. I don't know how to explain but too many years this person. Praise God. Any question? That's not a comment. Yeah.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.0s] According to the book of 1 Corinthians,
[1.8s] he is telling us that no man can lay no
[4.2s] other foundation than that which was
[6.7s] laid by Christ. And when Christ was
[9.7s] calling the Millerite movement that the
[12.8s] birth of the Remnant church must be
[14.6s] established, he he tried step by step
[18.3s] for the advancement of this truth. And
[21.4s] when the church apostiated and we
[24.2s] separated ourself that we may come and
[27.1s] establish this church, when you have
[29.1s] come and establish this church, it means
[30.9s] that we are not establishing another
[32.9s] foundation. But we are uh we want to
[35.6s] build the foundation that were laid by
[38.5s] Christ, that were laid by the prophets
[41.4s] and that were laid by the pioneers of
[43.7s] the church. Praise God. Are you getting
[46.0s] me up to that point? So we want to
[48.2s] discuss a topic called ordination and
[50.1s] credential. And before I do anything I
[53.6s] want to can you write ordination. What
[55.5s] is the meaning of ordination? Go with me
[57.7s] in Noah dictionary
[62.4s] ordination. Can you first come you tell
[65.8s] me I read on my own
[68.5s] ordination. You write the meaning of
[70.5s] ordination.
[72.5s] ministers, elders and judge members. I
[74.7s] want you to be keen and I don't want to
[77.0s] see any elder not writing. Kindly, you
[79.4s] may forgive me on that, but kindly
[81.5s] write. Kindly, please write ordination.
[85.4s] You write give me the meaning of
[86.9s] ordination. I want you to read with me.
[89.5s] The state of being ordained or
[93.2s] appointed establish order or tendency
[96.7s] consequent of an decree. Number two,
[100.4s] virtue always vice have natural relation
[103.1s] to the happiness and mystery of life
[106.3s] representative. Let me just proceed. Let
[109.0s] me run with you in number three. in the
[113.0s] priest priestbyarian and congregational
[115.9s] church. The act of settling or
[119.4s] establishing a license clergy man over a
[123.2s] church and congregational with pastoral
[126.4s] charge and authority. Also the act of
[130.1s] conferring on a clergy the powers of a
[134.0s] minister of the gospel without the
[136.8s] charge or oversight of a particular
[140.0s] church.
[143.8s] or a particular church but with general
[146.1s] powers of an evangelist who is
[148.3s] authorized to form churches and
[150.9s] administer the sacramental of baptism
[153.4s] and the Lord's supper where he may be
[156.1s] called to officiate I want you to mark
[158.9s] the last words the first statement is
[161.8s] saying that the state of being ordained
[165.0s] or
[166.5s] appointed it means that ordination for
[169.4s] you to be ordained
[170.6s] First you must be appointed. That is
[172.8s] number one. The second one when you are
[176.3s] ordained an evangelist or an elder first
[180.4s] you have to consider that what is your
[182.8s] biggest work to do sacramentals to do
[186.2s] baptism and to do the Lord's supper.
[189.8s] Praise God. It means that we have to be
[192.5s] ordained ordination must be in the
[195.1s] church of God. Number
[197.2s] two, give me
[200.1s] credential.
[202.3s] Credential. Then I try to tell you one
[204.9s] thing.
[205.7s] [Music]
[209.6s] Credential.
[211.9s] Credential.
[216.4s] Yes. Credential. Because the reason why
[219.5s] we try to investigate this thing because
[222.1s] when we are looking for the advent
[223.9s] movement, we look for the year 1861 when
[227.4s] this church was being established when
[230.0s] uh because in 1860 as we know the
[232.7s] seventh the saparian adventist was given
[236.0s] the name 7th day adventist and as we
[239.4s] proceed in the year 1861 the first
[242.2s] conference which was organized was the
[244.1s] mystigan conference and when mystigan
[247.0s] conference was organiz organized. First
[249.0s] they try to elect the chairman and they
[252.5s] try to elect CL cla and after that there
[256.4s] is first step of organization when you
[259.4s] want to flee to the gospel order first
[261.8s] we have to come to the organization but
[264.2s] there's first step when we want to say
[266.8s] that this body has been organized this
[269.8s] first step that we got to follow can we
[272.8s] read
[274.3s] credential you have been told that that
[276.8s] which give credit. Write that. That
[280.1s] which gives credit, that which give a
[283.0s] title or a claim to confidence, the
[285.7s] warrant on which belief, credit or
[288.2s] authorities claimed among strangers as
[291.7s] the letters of commendation and power
[293.7s] given by a government or ambassador or
[296.1s] envoy which give him credit at a foreign
[299.4s] court. So the powers of working miracles
[302.1s] given to apostles may be considered as
[304.6s] their credentials. authority to them to
[307.4s] propagate the gospel and entitling them
[310.4s] to credit. First word credential is that
[315.0s] which give a
[317.5s] credit. It means that when I have my
[320.4s] credential, it means that I have been
[322.9s] given a credit by this organization to
[325.9s] go and propagate this thing. Are we
[329.4s] okay? When I am in uncertain circle, I
[332.7s] can been given a credit. I can been
[335.2s] given a pro a water credential. Then
[338.2s] when I go to another company which we
[340.7s] are working with but not here in Kenya
[343.1s] maybe in America I can show my
[344.7s] credential they say ah you are our own
[347.8s] we are in one organization we are in one
[350.4s] circle to do this work. Are we
[353.5s] okay? So why credential? Because there's
[357.2s] something that tendency that has come to
[359.5s] this church that was in seventh
[361.4s] adventist church that when the church
[364.2s] when we want to put this church in order
[367.3s] in every way people there has been two
[369.8s] what two mind that when we organize our
[372.9s] church will come
[374.1s] Babylon do people have those minds that
[377.1s] when I organize I will lose
[380.3s] my son give me the
[384.0s] value when we organize
[386.8s] that many people fear that when I
[388.5s] organize I'm going to lose my influence.
[390.4s] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do
[391.9s] this. But before we organize, we must
[394.5s] know that the first step of organization
[396.6s] is ordination and
[398.9s] credential. Ordination and credential.
[401.2s] Go with me in the book of one
[404.3s] bio. The book of one bio.
[408.2s] The book of one
[409.6s] by page
[414.4s] 455. 455 paragraph number three. You
[418.1s] hear first when the Mexican conference
[420.2s] was organized because we have to know
[422.2s] that 7th adventure general was organized
[426.2s] in the year
[427.3s] 1863 but Michigan conference was
[430.3s] organized in the year 1861. So when the
[433.3s] Mexican conference was organized what
[435.1s] was the first step which was being
[436.7s] taken?
[438.0s] Read with me. It reads, it reads,
[440.5s] "Resolved that our minister papers
[442.8s] consist of a certificate of orination."
[444.7s] That it was resolved.
[447.4s] Our minister's papers consist of
[450.2s] certificate of ordination. First, the
[452.0s] papers of ministers must consist of one,
[455.2s] the certificate of coordination.
[457.5s] Coordination. Let me ask you, can I have
[460.2s] a certificate of coordination before
[462.4s] reaching that coordination?
[465.6s] for
[467.9s] certificate. It means that someone being
[471.6s] he must be
[473.8s] scrutinized. His ways must be first
[476.4s] investigated before being ordained. So
[479.6s] fast they told that it was in that it
[483.8s] was in
[485.2s] par that that our minister's papers
[488.7s] consist of certain valition also
[492.2s] credentials to be signed by chairman and
[497.0s] of the
[498.1s] conference. So right the first step of
[503.6s] coronation before writing that can you
[507.0s] read a
[509.6s] 18 a
[512.0s] 18 uh act of apostle 18 act of apostle
[517.0s] page 18
[520.6s] it reads it reads it was at the
[522.6s] ordination of the 12
[525.0s] it was at the ordination of the 12 that
[528.4s] the pastor step was taken in the
[529.8s] organization of the church that the
[531.4s] first step was taken in the ordination
[533.8s] of the of the church. So when we want to
[536.0s] call ourselves that we have organized
[537.6s] into one body, what should we do?
[539.4s] Ordination. Ordination. Praise God.
[541.8s] Amen. That a church be without
[543.6s] ordination without redemption. It is not
[547.1s] organized. It is going to
[549.7s] be praise God.
[553.5s] [Music]
[554.9s] Because the Christ has given was that go
[559.0s] and bring the gospel baptizing them in
[561.1s] the name of the father the son and the
[563.3s] of the holy spirit in you. So it means
[565.3s] that you cannot preach and bring people
[567.4s] to church without baptizing them and
[570.6s] without being bapt without baptizing
[572.7s] someone it means that you must be
[575.6s] ordained. So the first step of
[577.5s] organizing church is doing what is
[579.5s] called ordination. Are we clear at that
[582.3s] point?
[583.7s] So when we are in ordination is being
[586.7s] given a credit to offer sacmental
[589.5s] services the Lord that is number
[593.3s] one mark that so let us go one by so
[597.4s] when I I am being given credentials what
[601.5s] should be done first a credential is
[605.1s] being given to ministers there are
[607.6s] credential can be given to ministers who
[610.2s] are being ordained there are also
[613.0s] Credential that can be given ministers
[615.0s] to do to preach the gospel. Preach the
[618.0s] gospel. Credential is what is called
[621.0s] lense. Because we know the other day
[623.5s] that in the year 1833 Miller was given
[627.3s] license. But when did Miller started
[631.1s] preaching?
[632.9s] Yes. 1831. And he was licensed in which
[636.4s] year? It means that I cannot just enter
[639.0s] the gospel today and I am being given
[641.8s] the credential today. Are we sure at
[645.0s] that point I cannot enter the ministry
[648.0s] to do the gospel work today and in this
[650.5s] day or in this year being given a
[652.2s] credential it cannot work. It is
[655.0s] confusion and
[659.3s] below that a
[662.1s] credential should be signed by the
[664.6s] chairman and the cler of the conference.
[668.5s] That is number
[670.4s] one. Number
[672.9s] two that which credential shall be
[676.0s] renewed
[677.8s] annually? This credential shall be
[680.1s] renewed annually.
[683.4s] annually. Praise God.
[686.5s] So it means that when I been given a
[688.6s] credential in the next year this
[690.9s] credential should be renewed that
[695.5s] is they shall be renewed annually. So
[699.0s] the
[699.9s] question it means that if given a
[704.5s] credential has
[706.5s] been he has not been faithful in this
[710.2s] work in the next year can
[712.9s] he but let me ask you if I have been in
[717.2s] this church and in the next church or in
[720.9s] the
[722.4s] next should I be ordained
[726.5s] again should be ordained And then no. C
[730.6s] O D 173. C O D
[736.6s] 173. C O D
[739.5s] 173. 171 not
[742.3s] 1731 paragraph is paragraph number
[744.8s] seven. Verse 21 paragraph 7.
[748.9s] It reads paragraph 7. Paragraph 7 reads.
[751.4s] If a person who has been ordained to the
[753.3s] ministry, if a person who had been to
[756.6s] the ministry on account of ma
[760.1s] fails to have his credential renewed by
[762.0s] the conference who fails to have it
[764.3s] credential renewed to the conference is
[766.6s] he in that condition authorized to
[769.2s] baptize? Is he in that condition
[771.7s] authorized to baptize to officiate at
[774.4s] communion to officiate
[777.0s] at communion and perform the marriage
[779.7s] ceremony? to the
[782.6s] point
[784.7s] of according to the question number one
[790.5s] he has to he can baptize he can baptize
[793.6s] it mean that someone who is not being
[795.4s] ordained cannot baptize that is number
[797.9s] one
[799.6s] the holy communion
[801.6s] and communion can women be ordained
[805.8s] it means that they can officiate holy
[808.9s] communion thank you Number three, they
[811.8s] cannot perform a marriage ceremony.
[813.9s] Number three, they cannot perform
[815.5s] marriage means an elder who not can
[819.0s] perform a marriage
[822.7s] ceremony. Go with me
[825.0s] in
[828.6s] 173. It is 173 paragraph number four. It
[832.6s] reads, it reads, "Would it be proper for
[835.6s] one who has been ordained as an elder of
[837.8s] a local church
[841.6s] 173. Yes. Read now. Would it be proper
[845.0s] for one who has been ordained Will it be
[847.2s] proper for one who has been ordained as
[849.6s] an elder of a local church of an elder
[851.9s] of a local church but has not been
[853.9s] reelected but has not been reelected in
[856.6s] that church to take the lead in the
[858.2s] breaking of bread? Can he lead in the
[859.9s] breaking of the bread on baptism? That
[861.7s] is a question. What is the answer? If he
[864.1s] has been ordained as an elder church, if
[866.3s] an elder has been ordained as an elder
[868.3s] of this church and has been faithful in
[870.2s] church duties, if that has
[873.5s] been church duty although we moved to
[876.5s] another
[879.6s] church again, it might be for him to
[882.4s] officiate request by the church. Amen.
[890.0s] Can you again? It means that he has to
[892.9s] lose his credential
[896.0s] and before he can read again he must be
[900.8s] scrutinized
[903.1s] again that anger canain also ministers
[907.7s] can
[910.8s] be
[916.8s] okay to be what should
[919.9s] be P A P A N The time is there for
[926.0s] you. Prepare your questions. I'm almost
[929.3s] ending. PM PM
[936.0s] from a trip I'm sure before ordination
[939.6s] I'm not going to start
[942.9s] topic
[945.8s] min ordination paragraph paragraph
[948.6s] number one ordination in the is the
[951.0s] church's public recognition of divine
[962.8s] Because this by the laying on of hands
[969.0s] the church authorizes minister to teach
[971.5s] the
[973.7s] church authorize the church the church
[976.9s] authorizes ministers to teach that is
[979.8s] number one baptize to baptize and
[982.2s] organize churches and organize churches.
[984.9s] So who has been given to organize
[987.0s] churches? The ministries. Who? The
[989.7s] ministries. Ministers. And if a minister
[992.2s] has been ored, how many works can you
[994.1s] do?
[995.1s] Then he can teach. Number two, baptized.
[998.8s] Number three. Praise God. Amen. So after
[1003.0s] that acts 13:1 before being sent forth
[1006.8s] it says before being sent forth as
[1008.8s] missionary to the heist ministers it say
[1012.5s] but before being sent forth as
[1014.2s] missionary
[1016.8s] these apostles were solely dedicated to
[1019.0s] God these apostles were solely dedicated
[1022.2s] to God by fasting by prayer and by two
[1027.0s] prayer and the laying on of hands and
[1028.9s] number three by coordination.
[1032.2s] has been authorized by the church. They
[1035.1s] must be authorized by the church. Not
[1037.5s] only to teach the not only if you are
[1040.6s] not only to teach the truth but to
[1042.4s] perform the rights of baptism but to
[1044.3s] perform the rights of baptism and to
[1046.3s] organize churches number two to organize
[1048.4s] churches being invested fullical
[1051.9s] authority to teach the truth to baptize
[1055.0s] and organize churches. So
[1057.1s] before baptize you must
[1060.0s] be that your ordination must be
[1062.4s] authorized by the church. I can hear.
[1074.6s] Thank you. Number two reads before the
[1080.0s] nation and ministers write this that
[1082.5s] beforeation
[1084.0s] miners should give evidence that they
[1085.9s] have dedicated themselves the
[1088.0s] work should give their obligation that
[1091.1s] they dedicated their works to themselves
[1093.6s] the work. So if that minister is lagging
[1096.4s] here to here to here and dedicate
[1098.8s] yourself to God
[1103.8s] can dedicated his word to
[1107.5s] God but to God.
[1112.6s] There must be evidence on the part of
[1114.5s] those who take the song position of the
[1116.2s] shepherds that they have without
[1118.8s] reservation to be given themselves to
[1121.0s] the word. You must dedicate yourself
[1123.1s] first to the work of God. They must take
[1126.4s] Christ as their personal savior. They
[1128.3s] must take Christ as their personal
[1129.8s] savior. Hands laid upon men to ordain
[1132.4s] them for the ministry before they are
[1134.0s] thoroughly examined. Hands are laid upon
[1137.0s] them to the ministry before they are
[1138.7s] thoroughly examined as to their
[1140.6s] qualification for the sacred. But how
[1143.6s] much better would it be to make work
[1146.2s] before accepting them as ministers?
[1148.5s] But how much better would it be to make
[1151.2s] thorough work before accepting them as
[1154.2s] ministers than to have to go through
[1156.7s] this rigid examination? That to have to
[1159.0s] go through this rig examination become
[1162.2s] established in their position. Yes. And
[1165.0s] I'm not
[1174.5s] it must be scrutinized. Number one.
[1178.0s] Second
[1184.0s] item. There are two things in the
[1186.8s] ministry of God and the work of God.
[1188.9s] They are only licensed ministers and
[1191.3s] they are also ordained minister. I can
[1194.3s] be licensed as minister or I can be
[1196.5s] given a credential as a minister but I
[1198.7s] cannot baptist. I wish I get at that
[1203.1s] point. I can be licensed and I will
[1206.3s] bring the truth but I cannot do what you
[1209.4s] baptist. I cannot be baptized.
[1213.2s] Can you do one
[1215.6s] bio page 2 bio 173 biome
[1222.2s] 173 173 The paragraph is paragraph
[1225.7s] number one. Can you hear me? In the year
[1228.0s] 1867, what has happened? And I give you
[1231.0s] the age of baptism that has been in the
[1235.6s] 173 number one. The statistical report
[1238.6s] of the conference session list 28 today
[1241.8s] ministers
[1243.9s] say
[1246.1s] the statistical report of the conference
[1248.1s] session. This is the statistical report
[1250.3s] on the conference side in the year 1867
[1254.0s] listed 28 ordained ministers. How many
[1256.4s] ordained ministers?
[1258.0s] 28 ordained ministers. 10 licensed
[1261.2s] minister. 10 licensed ministers.
[1264.8s] 4320.
[1266.3s] Praise God. Amen. It means that I can be
[1269.5s] I can be
[1273.0s] lined. It means that not every ministers
[1276.1s] can do can do baptism can do lot
[1281.3s] marriage also also marriage praise God
[1286.0s] ministers let any minister define just
[1288.7s] baptizing and holding
[1291.6s] or if you are not being also in this
[1295.3s] work you will lose your predation and
[1297.8s] your
[1300.0s] ordination. So the church must ple into
[1303.4s] gospel order that these doors that the
[1306.8s] devils let in should be closed. So let
[1311.2s] me give some of the examples of
[1315.0s] the
[1316.9s] ericated
[1319.5s] miners. You write the year it was in the
[1323.0s] year 1854.

[1370.8s] He began preaching immediately. He began
[1373.0s] preaching immediately. I was obeying in
[1375.0s] the year 1854. Can you he was in which
[1378.7s] year? 1854. 1854. At which year? Go to
[1382.5s] the last words. It

[1398.0s] later to be known as the seventh day
[1399.9s] child this when he was only 22 years
[1404.7s] only 22 years old it means that a
[1407.4s] minister of 22 years old andained if he
[1411.4s] has been faithful in his work praise God
[1416.2s] amen when he was 32 years

[1458.3s] It reads 98 paragraph 5. Yes. Go and
[1463.0s] James. Can you if you can stress where
[1465.2s] Smith was 32 years? Uh how it says says
[1470.0s] the motion carried Smith was 32 years of
[1473.0s] age. Smith was 32 years of age. I have
[1476.2s] just the day before been ordained to the
[1478.6s] ministry. The ministry at which 32 years
[1485.2s] old are clear at that point the young
[1488.4s] can be ordained the alo can be done what
[1491.6s] can be
[1493.2s] ordained. So it means that we want to
[1496.5s] make a point of guidance we have given
[1499.4s] authority to that day. The reason I have
[1504.1s] shown you brother
[1506.4s] John was because the although this
[1511.7s] church in the year 1854 has not had a
[1515.4s] strong organization but they had strong
[1519.4s] leadership. No one could be recklessly
[1522.6s] allowed to or baptize
[1525.7s] before. So it means that when you guys
[1528.7s] are being ordained
[1531.1s] is considered. Can you read this
[1535.3s] book
[1540.5s] 360? You can write on choosing
[1543.4s] leadership
[1544.8s] or
[1547.7s] coordination with six.

[1563.2s] has had to bear in keeping things
[1565.5s] together let's work with him and sustain
[1568.0s] him yes brother MG Kellogg has done what
[1570.8s] he could brother MG Kellogg has done
[1574.1s] what he could he has an excellent spirit

[1589.6s] in spirit. No one has a word to find
[1593.0s] with
[1594.8s] him to find with him. If it means that
[1598.4s] church members have been calling and I
[1600.6s] ask you is there anyone
[1603.6s] with
[1605.6s] international then someone can I have a

[1627.8s] he puts forth will not see result in
[1629.6s] immediate good. Great. He was ordained
[1631.8s] at the camp meeting. He was ordained at
[1634.0s] the meeting and this will be a courage
[1635.9s] and strength to him. And this will be a
[1638.2s] courage and strength to him. His wife is
[1640.7s] a thoroughly converted woman. Unite
[1646.4s] before his wife must be what? Thorally
[1649.4s] converted. A thoroughly converted woman.
[1653.2s] Woman. Praise God.
[1656.2s] that is is not converted. He's not even
[1659.8s] as Adventist. Can I
[1663.4s] because my wife is unconverted?
[1667.1s] She has upon
[1669.4s] accountance expression of contentment
[1671.7s] and
[1672.9s] peace to the immediate surrounding.
[1676.6s] It means that also my wife must be
[1680.2s] considered if he's really is she really
[1684.0s] converted? Is she really
[1687.2s] converted? Going to the next one.

[1906.6s] There are
[1908.2s] so leaders as to ordain men who are in
[1911.3s] no way fitted for the
[1914.8s] respons but they are really unfitted
[1917.2s] with the work of we should have noticed
[1920.6s] but God has us to follow the order of
[1925.3s] men who need to be converted men who
[1927.8s] need to be converted elevated
[1930.6s] and noble and noble refined refined
[1933.2s] before they can serve the cause of God
[1934.8s] in any capacity to be converted. If I
[1938.0s] was having on some 12 years with this
[1940.5s] church, but has been I have not been
[1942.9s] really converted. I should the church
[1945.2s] will not take time
[1946.5s] to read them. Let gather both good and
[1950.4s] bad. It takes time for to be developed.
[1954.6s] There must be time to learn what men

[1974.2s] Are they in subjection? Are they in

[1989.0s] not converted.
[2002.3s] when it is the right of this
[2007.3s] church because they are qualified. It
[2010.5s] means that when you hear
[2016.6s] this that when my child is going to the
[2019.8s] institution the man is going to revote
[2022.4s] the the parents are going to receive the
[2024.1s] mark of the why because he's the head of
[2027.0s] the church also when an elder has been
[2029.7s] put at the head of the church and his
[2033.2s] child is going to the institution it
[2035.5s] means that the early church is going to
[2037.7s] receive the mark of beast
[2044.4s] Thank you my brother. It
[2049.3s] means that should not even be connected
[2052.0s] with the institution of the
[2055.5s] beast. Are you judgment? If your effort
[2059.0s] is on the other side, you walk to the on
[2062.0s] the other side and you also can you ask
[2065.6s] an elder of the church it means that he
[2067.8s] belongs to that city. If it's not a
[2070.2s] church member, can it be can we take
[2074.6s] elders
[2075.9s] from church to be an of this
[2079.6s] church? Can it be possible? It means
[2082.3s] that you can take
[2085.0s] an effort on that is not a church
[2089.0s] member. It means that the reason of me
[2092.4s] should be renewed to that
[2095.7s] again. He can be ordained. But if not,
[2099.4s] you cannot be
[2107.5s] without
[2109.7s] it. Will they do to the father's
[2112.5s] influence?
[2114.2s] To the father's influence. So it means
[2116.5s] that my child has not honored me in my
[2119.3s] house.
[2124.3s] If he has not tacked it not tacked
[2128.7s] wisdom
[2130.5s] or power of holiness at home in the
[2132.9s] managing his house it is safe to
[2136.5s] conclude that the same defect will be
[2138.3s] carried to the church. It is said that
[2139.9s] the same defect will be carried to the
[2141.8s] into the church. That's fine. These
[2143.5s] churches are our churches are good. Our
[2146.7s] churches are blind. Why? I can say
[2150.8s] church is blind because the church is
[2155.6s] not because of the church
[2160.4s] of
[2163.3s] blindness.
[2165.6s] Even the church will be
[2169.0s] blind. We not going to receive eternity.
[2172.4s] with the blind child. It says
[2176.2s] if he has not
[2179.2s] tal power goodness at home in managing
[2182.6s] his own family it is safe to conclude
[2185.1s] that the same defects will be carried
[2186.6s] into the church and the same
[2188.1s] unsanctified management will be seen
[2190.3s] there. It will be far better to
[2192.2s] criticize the man. It will be far better
[2194.4s] to criticize the man before he is put
[2196.9s] into office. You must be criticized
[2199.4s] before being put into an office. After
[2201.8s] what? But then after better to pray and
[2204.5s] cancel before the taking decisive step.
[2207.1s] To pray and cancel before taking into
[2209.2s] that office than to labor to correct the
[2211.5s] consequence of a wrong move.

[2317.7s] cannot be of use to the church. But
[2321.0s] example and influence example and
[2324.5s] influence disqualifies him to exert a

[2955.1s] three. Question number three. Number
[2958.2s] three. Yes. It reads, "Shall young
[2960.7s] preachers shall young preachers for
[2962.9s] being ordained before young preachers
[2964.8s] being ordained be allowed be allowed to
[2967.4s] baptize resolved. It was resolved that
[2970.5s] no person omega
[2974.0s] that no person young or old an
[2976.8s] evangelist young or an old elder should
[2980.3s] administer ordinances before being
[2982.2s] obeyed should not administer ordinances
[2985.4s] ordinances baptism and
[2991.6s] lots it means an elder who has not been
[2994.3s] ordained should not be allowed
[2997.0s] to baptize Yes. Praise God. It means
[3001.4s] that if you are baptized
[3003.9s] by what baptized by an elder who has not
[3007.3s] been obeyed, you have to be rebaptized
[3009.8s] again. If you baptized by an elder who
[3012.0s] has not believed
[3013.5s] in, you have to be baptized. And I know
[3017.0s] you know what the message means.
[3021.8s] You read me SP1.5 as you prepare your
[3024.6s] question. SPN
[3029.5s] reads it reads I saw the nominal chart
[3033.5s] page two
[3036.3s] SPM
[3047.9s] 3.8.8 It says it. So those who have been
[3052.2s] drawing the churches
[3056.7s] just read says it say I saw those who
[3059.7s] have been baptized as the churches. I
[3061.7s] saw that those who have been baptized as
[3063.4s] going into the churches have to be
[3065.0s] baptized again as the faith. They have
[3067.1s] to be baptized again into the door or
[3068.9s] they go missing. Those who have not been
[3071.6s] baptized since 1844. Those who have not
[3073.8s] been baptized since 1844. You have to be
[3076.5s] before Jesus come. You have to be
[3078.1s] baptized before Jesus comes.
[3084.0s] This church will not progress. The
[3085.8s] reason why our publishing house is not
[3088.7s] working. Ministers are converted. Elders
[3092.0s] are unconverted. The church members you
[3094.6s] are not able to pro. Why? Because you
[3098.1s] are not being
[3099.7s] baptized. You have been baptized by
[3101.8s] someone who does not allow the message.
[3107.6s] If I could have time, we could read over
[3110.4s] and
[3113.9s] after I know you know what the third
[3116.2s] angel's message
[3118.8s] is. After the third angel's message, you
[3121.7s] have to be rebaptized again. After
[3124.1s] learning the Sabbath message, you have
[3126.7s] to be rebaptized again. Let me conclude
[3129.3s] at that
[3132.2s] point. Can you read? Then I saw those
[3134.8s] who stand making up the bridge and
[3137.4s] standing in the former sees 184 written
[3140.7s] the commandments and so follow the yes
[3144.2s] as the first day instead of the seven.
[3146.3s] Yes. See the light shown out of the
[3149.1s] Muslim. Yes.
[3152.0s] Given up the institutions of the pop.
[3157.8s] Are you understanding?
[3161.8s] [Music]
[3165.7s] It reads, can you kindly understand this
[3168.6s] kindly?
[3170.6s] It reads, it reads, "The night I saw
[3172.8s] those whose hands are engaged in making
[3174.6s] up the bridge, the night I saw that
[3176.3s] those whose hand are engaged in making
[3178.3s] up the bridge and are standing in the
[3180.4s] gap and are standing in the gap that are
[3182.6s] formerally since 1844 formerally since
[3185.5s] 1844 broken the commandments.
[3188.2s] The
[3192.4s] commandment way of
[3197.2s] eating
[3199.7s] marri as to keep the first day instead
[3202.2s] of the seven. You want to keep the first
[3204.2s] day instead of the and you have seen the
[3206.4s] light shone out of the most holy place.
[3208.8s] See the light sh out of the most holy
[3211.0s] place. Change their course. You must
[3212.8s] change your course even at the
[3214.6s] institution of the poor. You will leave
[3216.7s] the institution of the word for the pop
[3219.7s] and are keeping God's Sabbath would have
[3222.6s] to go down into the water. You have to
[3225.0s] go down into the waters and be baptized
[3227.3s] in the faith of the sanctuary
[3230.7s] and be baptized in the faith of the
[3232.5s] sanctuary and keep the commandment of
[3234.6s] God and the faith of Jesus. Praise God.
[3236.8s] Amen. If you are baptized and you have
[3238.7s] gone back to the institution of the
[3240.9s] beast, Babylonian
[3243.4s] institutions, you have to be rebaptized
[3246.9s] again. How many have gone to the
[3249.0s] institution of the beast after being
[3251.3s] baptized? How many have been baptized by
[3253.8s] the elders in the institutions of the
[3256.0s] beast? You have to go down into the
[3258.8s] water again. But you cannot go down to
[3261.4s] the you will not have any progress.
[3264.8s] there will be no progress in
[3269.6s] you. I don't know how to explain
[3274.8s] but too many years this person.
[3284.8s] Praise God. Any question?
[3291.8s] That's not a comment. Yeah.
