Let me read this page as I am coming to the end of my presentation so that we might have social meeting. I wish electricity will be there so that this one be projected. Studies on Christian education. Let me read this page. I'm giving you the page. That book is there. Brother lawyer has that book. If you want studies on Christian education by EA Southerntherlands, just go to law. We will show you where to get it. But this book says something about the suits. I'm getting the page. Yeah, this is page. Uh yeah, page nine. This is page nine. It begins from page nine. Says the following one. Listen to me. I'm coming to the end of this presentation. If you're tired, don't worry. Another program is coming. It says this study should make it clear that the Protestant teachers weaken and unfitted the Protestant denomination for the attack made by the papacy through the counter system of education introduced by Ly Lyola founder of the order of Jews. Are we together? So if you are writing write this you need to write this and understand this is a good a good one that the order of Jesus was founded was was founded by who Ignatius lawyer which year 1530 34 are we together right that so we are told that through the system of education introduced by Ju papacy attacked the protestant what denomination alleo how many are protestants you want to protest you know when the topic presented Protest until death when a call is made all of us will decide to be protect protestants. Now 7th Day Adventist who are protestants in the last days must listen to this. It continues by saying before this the Catholic Church realized its helplessness to withstand the great movement of what? Protestantism. Hallelujah. Before the order of Jesus was created Catholic could not withstand protest protestantism. Are we together? Hallelujah. Hey, how many people are in this room? Stop joking with me. Hallelujah. Need to speak. Amen. So that you encourage me. Let me read this again. It says that before this the Catholic Church realized its helplessness to withstand the great movement of protestantism inaugurated by thousands of missionaries trained in the Christian schools of Luther and Mel Meelon. Are we together? I read something about history of Luther and Bangon. And we were told in the book studies on Christian education that Luther and Bangon understood the true science of what? education. Hallelujah. That is why it says in pamplet 081 that locus says to strengthen reformation the bible must be h people doesn't open p 081 page 37 there's something lu is saying we are referring to luther l the reason why there was success in luther's reformation was that l understood the true science of what education I want just 37 paragraph one says the early reformers realized They could not opt to succeed if their children were educated in Roman Catholic with Roman Catholic what? Teachers. Hallelujah. Roa says that the Bible must be studied. Teachers must be done what? Provided. Hallelujah. Do you know that God has given in his church all capabilities and abilities? Do you think we cannot get teachers from this congregation? They are teachers. Hallelujah. There are people who can teach. Amen. Brother Lord, do you want to tell me that you cannot teach? You can. But it is only that the ability of teaching is belongs to somewhere somewhere else. So Luther says, continue reading. Says that Luther says that the Bible must be studied. Uh teachers must be provided. Schools must be done. What? Make a just make a full stop that will make my presentation on Monday that school must be established. Hallelujah. We have to have our school our schools where we have our own teachers not teachers of Roman Catholic churches. Are we together? And somebody might ask me that. So teachers who are in general conference of 7th day Adventist. I will refer you to the Adventist timeline that is 1981 where Neil C. is declaring that the general conference as is another universal and truly Catholic what? Catholic church. Are we together? So Luther the the reason why Luther succeeded in reformation and could not be stopped by Catholics is that he understood the true science of what? Education. Nothing returned of the Protestant churches to dead orthodoxy under the inefficient leadership of Luther successors. The papar recognized the vulnerable point in what? Protestantism. Are we together? Purposely recognize what the vulnerable point in what? Protestantism. The order of Jesus found its special mission in combating the reformation. Reformation as the most effective means of arresting the progress of Protestantism. It aimed at controlling what? Education. Are we together? Good. I wish you so that when I when I read Yeah. You can help me read that point where it says that the protest the the order of Jesus funds it special mission. It says Jesus found it mission. The order of Jesus founds its mission special mission in combating the reformation as the most effective means of arresting the pro progress of protestantism. It aimed at controlling what? Education. If you want to control the farmers, what do you control? The education. much they are reformers they are serving brown chapati and brown rice they want to use they don't want to use aluminium alone they don't want to use plastic plates but if you want to combat them you only control their what leave alone the food they eat that one you cannot control them because when you make them go that they cannot buy food the teacher of ABC will tell them we can make our own food food the teacher of country living will tell them go to what countries and for your own what? Food. Food and you realize that a reformer will be able to produce his own maze, produce his own vegetables. But there's something that if you control it together. So it continues by saying it developed an immense educational activity. It developed immense educational activity in Protestant countries. In Protestant what? Countries. And add for it school a great reputation. Uhhuh. More than any other agency. It stayed the progress of reformation. Uh-huh. And it even succeeded in winning back a territory already conquered by Protestantis. It succeeded in winning back the ter territory or already conquered by what? Protestantism. Protestantism. Are you listening to this thing? Read that statement again. More than any other agency. More than any other agency. It stayed in the progress of the reformation and it even it even succeeded in winning succeeded in winning a place where Protestantism must conquer and conquer. Are we together? So if Protestantis would have conquered the place here in Sabume there's a church in Sabume for purposely through education will do what? Conquer it. Conquer conquer it. Amen. But if protesters are going to understand the true science of what education, then their information is going to succeed just like that one of me. Continue reading. It worked chiefly. It worked chiefly through its schools. Through its what? Schools. Of which of which it established. It established and control what? Large numbers. Large numbers. Hallelujah. Jesus are controlling what? Large numbers through what? Education. Education. Are we together? Remember chapter what? Chapter 4 where there was a a tree and every beast was under that what that tree and every human being could find meat under what what that tree and we realize that that tree is the system of what education are we together so education is everything in other words you need to understand that in the world education is everything just like redemption education is done what it's everything so you find yourself in the worldly system of education no no redemption no redemption amen no sanctification of The church, are we together? The church cannot be sanctified with the Jesuit system of what? Education. Are we together? No sanctification. Hallelujah. Just say amen. Continue reading, brother Lloy. Every member of their order, every member of their order became a became a competent and a practical what? Teacher. So who are teachers in those school? Competent and practical teacher. Teacher. Are we together? So Jesus were teachers. So if you want to know that Jesus are teachers go to the next you want to see the methods of their teaching. So if this methods are in some system education know that you are being taught by Jesus and by that you are going to observe the popish word right together. However much you come and tell us you read to us first that is first Thessalonians where Paul is talking about great apostasy. Yeah. First Thessalonians chapter 2 that the coming of Christ shall not be before great what? Apostasy before man of what? Man of sin. If you come and preach man of sin then there's another way you are going to observe the rise of the man of sin in another form another form. So look at this. The following it says the following methods of teaching the following methods of teaching are characteristic of Jesus are characteristics of Jesus what? Schools. Are we together? Listen to characteristics of Jesuit what? School. So if you see a school today with this characteristics know that that papacy is destroying what? Protestantism. And if protesters are taking their children to that system, let us just understand that this reformation is going to do what? To fall. Hallelujah. We realize that what made the fall of the denomination in 1844 is that they never understood the true science of what? Education. Education. Hallelujah. And we are told that the condition of those Protestants is is is explained by the foolish what? Virgins. What were the foolish virgins lacking? Oil. The oil. Are we together? So a true science of education is an oil to the lamp. The lamp. If that oil is removed, the lamp must do what? Must die. Are we together? Even this church today, if that lamp is removed from the church, the church must die. The oil is removed from the lamp. If that oil is removed from the lamp, the church must do what? Do you know the reason why there's confusion in the church? There's no if there is no what? And and if there is oil, that oil is not pure. Are we together? That oil is still mixed with kerosene. Are we together? Still mix with some petrol. It's not pure. What? Pl. So there's going to be a confusion in the what? Continue reading. The following methods of teaching The following methods of teaching are characteristic of are characteristics of Jesuit school. The memory was cultivated. The memory was cultivated as a means of as a means of of keeping down reactivity of thought reactivity of thought and clearness of judgment and clearness of judgment. I don't understand that statement. Brother help me understand. Help me understand that statement. I would read because the memory was cultivated as a means of keeping down of reactivity of thought and clearness of judgment. Hey, these statements by these people are very difficult. Continue reading. I know we are going to understand the next statement will help us understand the other one. Continue. It says it says in the place of self-government in the place of self self-government their method of discipline their method of discipline was a system of mutual distrust was a system of mutual mutual distrust distrust espunage and informing okay continue reading implicit implicit obedience receive the pupils from all responsibility as the moral justification of their deeds continue the jets made much of emulation The Jesus made much of emulation.

Uhhuh. The Jesus made much of emulation. He who knows how to exite emulation. He who knows how to do what? Exite emulation. Exite emulation has found the most powerful auxiliary in his teaching. Uh-huh. Continue reading. Nothing will be more honorable. Nothing will be more honorable in the Jesuit system of school than to outstrip a fellow student. To outstrip a fellow what? student that is the system of education that if you another another student imagine you are in top 10 imagine in a class of 600 I was in a school where one class was 639 and imagine you are the first one to be called and you are given honorsh you given hope that is the system of educ education are we together continue reading Nothing will be more honorable to the out of our fellow student to outstrip a fellow student.

Admonition. admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come. Hallelujah. Let me stop from that point. I'll pick from that point where we are told that we have to have a system of education that will repudiate all the principles that make the image of the what? The beast. Hallelujah. But yesterday we studied and realized that much of the current system of education is of the character that will give the image of the beast power. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are we together?

[70.8s] protestantism worship has also be
[73.9s] established and I told you that one
[76.3s] thing one objective for the purposes is
[79.7s] to overthrow Protestantism.
[82.6s] We will get controversy by 234. We've
[85.5s] realized that throughout let me repeat
[88.6s] this quotation from the beginning. You
[91.1s] can just help me read from the project
[93.3s] so that all of us might get might get
[96.2s] involved in this presentation. It it
[99.3s] says it
[101.3s] reads one. Uh let me let me this one
[106.3s] should be
[110.4s] one throughout throughout Christianom.
[113.4s] Protestantism was by formidable force.
[116.5s] Protestantism was by formidable force.
[119.9s] Past triumph of information pass. The
[121.9s] past trials of information passed like
[124.1s] no and any other
[127.0s] personh forces and Rome came with new
[129.8s] what forces
[131.9s] to accomplish his destruction to
[133.8s] accomplish the destruction of what
[137.8s] at this time? At this time order of
[140.2s] Jesuit was created. Order of Jesus was
[142.8s] done what? Created created. So for for
[145.8s] Rome to to overthrow Protestantism, it
[149.3s] had to come with another another force.
[151.8s] And that for was that the order of Jesus
[154.2s] was created. The most cruel they are the
[158.3s] most cruel and scrupulous.
[161.1s] as they cannot powerful of all the
[163.7s] champions of the the most powerful of
[166.6s] the champions
[168.1s] of cut off
[171.2s] from what
[174.1s] in human interest in human interest to
[177.8s] the claims of natural affliction. They
[179.4s] are dead to the claims of natural
[181.4s] affliction. Reason and concerns fall
[183.9s] silence. Their results and concerns are
[186.2s] to what? Silence. Silence. Hallelujah.
[188.6s] Like in fact they work as papacy itself
[190.9s] by the way do you know that papacy
[192.6s] doesn't what change I remember when my
[196.0s] brother Maxwell was presenting another
[198.2s] day here he read a quotation where he
[200.6s] said that robe never changes hallelujah
[204.2s] that is the characteristics of
[206.9s] that as I'm presenting this I remember
[209.9s] another presentation during prophecy
[212.1s] that there are how many things that must
[213.8s] happen five things that must happen and
[217.7s] one of things that there was death of
[220.7s] whatantism. Then people shall view
[222.9s] papacy in a positive what a positive
[225.8s] view. So you need to understand that in
[227.7s] the last days what must be destroyed.
[230.2s] Then the papacy believe that is
[232.9s] protestant protest. Don't protesting
[236.2s] must be destroy destroyed. But the Bible
[238.6s] says that the papacy is going to destroy
[241.8s] these people skillfully and what?
[244.7s] Wonderfully. Wonderfully. Continue
[246.4s] reading. They knew no rule. They knew no
[248.6s] rule. No tie. No tie. But that of their
[251.2s] order. But that of their order. And no
[253.1s] duty but to extend its powers. The
[256.0s] gospel of Christ, the gospel of Christ
[258.5s] enable it. Enable it.
[262.2s] Endure suffering. And endure what?
[265.0s] Suffering. Suffering. Hallelujah. Amen.
[268.0s] To make decision for Christ need to
[270.6s] understand for Christ what? Danger and
[274.5s] suffering. Suffering. That is what the
[275.8s] Bible says. Hallelujah. And we always
[278.8s] saying that must be of the skies on
[282.5s] earth of what
[285.1s] others the pride. Hallelujah. So you
[287.7s] need to understand that those who are
[289.7s] going to go to heaven must suffer
[292.1s] what? Hallelujah. Early writings I'm
[295.7s] putting you that heaven is cheap enough
[297.9s] through what? Suffering. Suffering.
[299.6s] Hallelujah. Amen. We need to understand
[302.2s] that the the the principles of
[304.7s] Christianity allowed their adherence to
[307.4s] do what? to
[309.1s] suffer to uh the gospel of Christ had
[312.6s] enabled its to meet danger and endure
[316.2s] suffering and is made by call hunger
[319.6s] toil and poverty to uphold the bar of
[322.9s] the truth in the face in face of the
[325.6s] rock the dion and the and the stake to
[329.2s] combat this
[331.2s] process jud inspired its followers
[335.2s] withism that enabled them to endure the
[337.7s] like What? Like forces, like ders. Are
[340.8s] we together? And to oppose to the power
[343.1s] of truth all weapons of
[346.5s] deceptions. There was no crime too great
[349.3s] for them to do what? To commit. To
[350.8s] commit. No deception too p to do what?
[353.5s] To practice. Practice. Hallelujah. Amen.
[356.1s] It continues by saying no is too
[358.5s] difficult for them to do what? To
[359.9s] assume. Hallelujah. Jesus can assume
[362.6s] everything. Amen. Jesus can even come to
[365.6s] the meeting and sit together with you.
[367.4s] Hallelujah. And when you will bearing
[369.9s] those who are going to comment after
[371.6s] less can carry up their comment.
[375.0s] Hallelujah. But that great order is to
[377.4s] destroy what roantantism and all the
[380.1s] weapons of deception are going to be
[383.0s] established. It continues by saying that
[385.8s] B to perpetual what? Poverty and
[389.4s] humility. It was their studied aim to
[392.7s] secure wealth and power to be devoted to
[395.3s] the overthrow of what? Protestantism and
[398.4s] to reestablish the purpose of popular
[400.4s] what? Supremacy. Hallelujah. So the
[402.7s] order of Jesuits what Jesuits are
[404.6s] working for is to overthrow what?
[407.2s] Protestantism and establish what?
[410.1s] Supremacy. Do you know that papacy knows
[412.6s] very well that when protestantism
[415.2s] increases then their power is going to
[418.1s] do what? Decrease. Great controversy 39
[421.0s] will tell you that when these people
[422.9s] continue preaching they shall be burning
[425.0s] their own altars. Are we together? If
[428.2s] protesters continue to preach, they are
[430.5s] going to burn the altars of papacy. Are
[433.4s] we together? So we are told
[437.6s] that while appearing as a member of
[439.9s] their council, I want that to be
[441.3s] projected with this
[446.5s] electricity. Amen.
[454.6s] Selen
[456.0s] proceed that one is coming. I'm still in
[458.6s] great controversy page 235 paragraph
[461.4s] one. This is the last thing I'm reading
[462.8s] in great controversy. Then after that
[464.6s] I'm going to read something in a book
[466.4s] called Christian studies on Christian
[468.0s] education. Then by the end of that I'll
[470.4s] be able to end my presentation.
[473.8s] It continues by saying while appearing,
[477.0s] are you able to read? Proceed. While
[479.4s] appearing as the members of their order,
[481.4s] while Jesus appearing at the members of
[483.3s] their order, they wore a g of sanctity.
[485.3s] They have a g of sanctity. Visiting
[487.6s] prisons and hosts visiting prisons and
[490.0s] what hosts.

[493.5s] to the what? The sick. To the sick and
[495.9s] the poor. And the poor. Professing to
[498.5s] have renounced the world. Professing to
[500.4s] have renounced the water. are bearing
[502.1s] the sacred name of Jesus. They bear the
[504.1s] sacred name of Jesus. Jesus went about
[506.9s] doing what? Doing good. Doing good. Are
[509.1s] we together? So we are told that all
[511.1s] these Christians they also they bear the
[513.0s] name of Jesus. They are doing good just
[515.2s] like Jesus. Are we together? Did Jesus
[517.9s] care for the poor? Yes, he cared. Did he
[520.3s] care for the sick? Absolutely he cared.
[522.3s] Hallelujah. So Jesus are also doing the
[524.4s] same the same. But next statement says
[527.0s] continue. But under this blameless
[529.0s] exterior, under this blameless exterior,
[531.8s] most criminal and deadly purposes,
[533.8s] criminal and deadly what purposes were
[536.9s] were often done what? Concealed. It was
[539.7s] the fundamental principle of the order
[543.0s] that the end justifies the what the
[546.2s] means. Hallelujah. Jesus know very well
[548.4s] that if you want to accomplish
[550.0s] something, what you want to accomplish
[552.0s] will be showing you what to do at the
[553.6s] present state. Are we together? Just
[556.3s] talk to me. the electricity. So I want
[558.5s] to get encouraged. I'm soon finishing
[560.2s] this presentation. Hallelujah. So we are
[562.7s] told that it is their principle that the
[565.0s] order that the end justifies the means.
[568.3s] By this code, which the end justifies
[571.3s] the what? The means. By this code,
[575.1s] lying,
[577.5s] theft, assassination were not only
[580.6s] various this guy uh were not only
[583.4s] pardonable but com commendable. When
[586.6s] they serve the interest of the the
[589.3s] church and various disguise the Jesus
[592.5s] worked their way into offices of what
[595.8s] state. Are we together? They work their
[598.0s] way into the office of the the state. So
[600.4s] who are advising R today? Jesuits. Are
[603.6s] we together? Who are advising other
[606.2s] presidents? The Jesuits just say because
[608.9s] that is what the testimony says. They

[650.7s] and schools for the common what? The
[653.5s] common people and that children of
[655.4s] Protestant parents were drawn into an
[658.9s] observance of popish what rights.
[661.6s] Hallelujah. Is that wonderful? Is that
[664.9s] skillful? The Bible says that the the
[667.2s] purpose he destroys wonderfully and
[669.5s] skillfully. So when he want to deal with
[671.6s] the church then he established what
[673.8s] colleges for the those who have money
[675.7s] are we together those who have money for
[678.7s] those who don't have money schools are
[681.2s] establish then they take their what
[683.5s] their children are we together that is
[685.8s] purpose and I'm talking about purple
[687.9s] system of what education but I need to
[690.6s] know in your mind that there's another
[692.6s] kind of what education hallelujah I want

[705.3s] schools for the common what the common
[707.5s] people and we are told that the children
[710.2s] of protesters were drawn into an
[713.0s] observance of poish what rights all the
[716.6s] outward pump and display of romanish
[720.2s] worship was brought to bear to confuse
[723.7s] the mind and dazzle and captivate the
[727.3s] imagination and that's the liberty for
[729.6s] which the fathers had toiled and bled
[733.1s] was betrayed by the what? The sons. The
[736.4s] Jews rapidly spread themselves over
[738.8s] what? Europe. And wherever they went,

[770.5s] told that the liberty that the father
[773.9s] toiled was betrayed by the son the sons.

[783.0s] their what? Their children. Are we
[785.1s] together? So fathers are toiling for
[787.0s] liberty. Then the children's
[789.2s] betray are we together. So that is what

[799.9s] education. Studies on Christian
[801.8s] education. Let me read this page as I am
[805.4s] coming to the end of my presentation so
[806.9s] that we might have social meeting. I
[808.7s] wish electricity will be there so that
[810.7s] this one be
[812.8s] projected. Studies on Christian
[814.9s] education. Let me read this page. I'm
[817.4s] giving you the page. That book is there.
[819.7s] Brother lawyer has that book. If you
[821.5s] want studies on Christian education by
[824.0s] EA Southerntherlands, just go to law. We
[826.3s] will show you where to get it. But this
[828.2s] book says something about the
[831.6s] suits. I'm getting the
[839.3s] page. Yeah, this is page.
[845.1s] Uh yeah, page nine. This is page nine.
[848.3s] It begins from page nine. Says the
[850.7s] following one. Listen to me. I'm coming
[852.2s] to the end of this presentation. If
[854.0s] you're tired, don't worry. Another
[856.2s] program is coming. It says this study
[859.9s] should make it clear that the Protestant
[862.7s] teachers weaken and unfitted the
[865.9s] Protestant denomination for the attack
[868.6s] made by the papacy through the counter
[871.4s] system of education introduced by Ly
[875.1s] Lyola founder of the order of Jews. Are
[878.6s] we together? So if you are writing write
[880.6s] this you need to write this and
[881.9s] understand this is a good a good one
[883.8s] that the order of Jesus was founded was
[886.1s] was founded by who Ignatius lawyer which
[889.3s] year
[890.3s] 1530 34 are we together right that so we
[893.9s] are told that through the system of
[895.8s] education introduced by Ju papacy
[899.0s] attacked the protestant what
[900.9s] denomination alleo how many are
[903.3s] protestants you want to
[905.7s] protest you know when the topic
[908.5s] presented Protest until death when a
[910.4s] call is made all of us will decide to be
[912.6s] protect protestants. Now 7th Day
[914.6s] Adventist who are protestants in the
[916.6s] last days must listen to this. It
[918.4s] continues by saying before this the
[920.9s] Catholic Church realized its
[923.7s] helplessness to withstand the great
[926.3s] movement of what?
[928.3s] Protestantism. Hallelujah. Before the
[930.7s] order of Jesus was created Catholic
[933.5s] could not withstand protest
[936.0s] protestantism. Are we together?
[939.2s] Hallelujah. Hey, how many people are in
[942.0s] this
[946.0s] room? Stop joking with me. Hallelujah.
[949.0s] Need to speak. Amen. So that you
[951.0s] encourage me. Let me read this again. It
[953.4s] says that before this the Catholic
[956.3s] Church realized its helplessness to
[959.1s] withstand the great movement of
[962.2s] protestantism inaugurated by thousands
[965.0s] of missionaries trained in the Christian
[968.0s] schools of Luther and Mel Meelon. Are we
[972.0s] together? I read something about history
[974.5s] of Luther and Bangon. And we were told
[976.6s] in the book studies on Christian
[977.9s] education that Luther and Bangon
[980.1s] understood the true science of what?
[982.3s] education. Hallelujah. That is why it
[984.9s] says in pamplet 081 that locus says to
[989.1s] strengthen reformation the bible must be
[992.2s] h people doesn't open p 081 page 37
[995.9s] there's something lu is saying we are
[997.8s] referring to luther l the reason why
[1000.4s] there was success in luther's
[1002.0s] reformation was that l understood the
[1004.8s] true science of what education I want
[1007.1s] just 37 paragraph one
[1009.6s] says the early reformers realized
[1014.3s] They could not opt to
[1016.3s] succeed if their children were educated
[1019.6s] in Roman Catholic with Roman Catholic
[1022.6s] what? Teachers. Hallelujah. Roa says
[1027.0s] that the Bible must be
[1031.3s] studied. Teachers must be done what?
[1034.3s] Provided. Hallelujah. Do you know that
[1036.9s] God has given in his church all
[1038.6s] capabilities and abilities? Do you think
[1040.9s] we cannot get teachers from this
[1042.2s] congregation? They are teachers.
[1044.1s] Hallelujah. There are people who can
[1046.1s] teach. Amen. Brother Lord, do you want
[1048.4s] to tell me that you cannot teach? You
[1050.2s] can. But it is only that the ability of
[1052.2s] teaching is belongs to somewhere
[1053.8s] somewhere else. So Luther says, continue
[1055.9s] reading.
[1057.4s] Says that Luther says that the Bible
[1060.8s] must be studied. Uh teachers must be
[1065.6s] provided. Schools must be done. What?
[1069.3s] Make a just make a full stop that will
[1071.4s] make my presentation on Monday that
[1073.3s] school must be established. Hallelujah.
[1075.9s] We have to have our school our schools
[1078.2s] where we have our own teachers not
[1079.8s] teachers of Roman Catholic churches. Are
[1082.2s] we together? And somebody might ask me
[1085.4s] that. So teachers who are in general
[1087.5s] conference of 7th day Adventist. I will
[1089.5s] refer you to the Adventist timeline that
[1092.4s] is
[1093.4s] 1981 where Neil C. is declaring that the
[1096.3s] general conference as is another
[1098.0s] universal and truly Catholic what?
[1099.9s] Catholic church. Are we together? So
[1102.0s] Luther the the reason why Luther
[1104.1s] succeeded in reformation and could not
[1106.1s] be stopped by Catholics is that he
[1108.0s] understood the true science of what?
[1109.5s] Education. Nothing returned of the
[1112.2s] Protestant churches to dead orthodoxy
[1115.1s] under the inefficient leadership of
[1117.3s] Luther successors. The papar recognized
[1120.4s] the vulnerable point in what?
[1123.6s] Protestantism. Are we together?
[1125.8s] Purposely recognize what the vulnerable
[1128.4s] point in what? Protestantism. The order
[1131.4s] of Jesus found its special mission in
[1134.6s] combating the reformation. Reformation
[1137.0s] as the most effective means of arresting
[1141.0s] the progress of Protestantism. It aimed
[1144.8s] at controlling
[1146.9s] what? Education. Are we together? Good.
[1150.8s] I wish
[1152.4s] you so that when I when I
[1157.7s] read Yeah. You can help me read that
[1160.2s] point where it says that the protest the
[1163.0s] the order of Jesus funds it special
[1164.6s] mission. It says Jesus found it mission.
[1169.7s] The order of Jesus founds its
[1172.2s] mission special
[1174.1s] mission in combating the
[1177.2s] reformation as the most effective
[1180.9s] means of arresting the pro progress of
[1185.1s] protestantism. It aimed at controlling
[1188.8s] what? Education. If you want to control
[1192.1s] the farmers, what do you control? The
[1194.1s] education.
[1195.8s] much they are reformers they are serving
[1197.3s] brown chapati and brown rice they want
[1199.3s] to use they don't want to use aluminium
[1202.0s] alone they don't want to use plastic
[1204.6s] plates but if you want to combat them
[1206.7s] you only control their what leave alone
[1208.9s] the food they eat that one you cannot
[1211.4s] control them because when you make them
[1214.2s] go that they cannot buy food the teacher
[1217.4s] of ABC will tell them we can make our
[1219.7s] own food food the teacher of country
[1222.2s] living will tell them go to what
[1224.1s] countries and for your own what? Food.
[1225.9s] Food and you realize that a reformer
[1227.3s] will be able to produce his own maze,
[1229.8s] produce his own vegetables. But there's
[1232.0s] something that if you
[1233.8s] control it together. So it continues by
[1236.6s] saying
[1238.6s] it developed an immense educational
[1240.2s] activity. It developed immense
[1242.3s] educational activity in Protestant
[1244.2s] countries. In Protestant what?
[1246.3s] Countries. And add for it school a great
[1248.8s] reputation. Uhhuh. More than any other
[1251.4s] agency. It stayed the progress of
[1253.4s] reformation. Uh-huh. And it even
[1255.0s] succeeded in winning back a territory
[1257.4s] already conquered by Protestantis. It
[1259.4s] succeeded in winning back the ter
[1261.8s] territory or already conquered by what?
[1264.0s] Protestantism. Protestantism. Are you
[1265.8s] listening to this
[1269.2s] thing? Read that statement again. More
[1271.9s] than any other agency. More than any
[1274.0s] other agency. It stayed in the progress
[1275.8s] of the reformation and it even it even
[1279.0s] succeeded in winning succeeded in
[1280.6s] winning a place where Protestantism must
[1284.3s] conquer and conquer. Are we together? So
[1286.7s] if Protestantis would have conquered the
[1288.5s] place here in Sabume there's a church in
[1290.2s] Sabume for purposely through education
[1292.2s] will do what? Conquer it. Conquer
[1293.9s] conquer it. Amen. But if protesters are
[1296.6s] going to understand the true science of
[1297.9s] what education, then their information
[1300.2s] is going to succeed just like that one
[1302.3s] of me. Continue reading. It worked
[1305.4s] chiefly. It worked chiefly through its
[1307.6s] schools. Through its what? Schools. Of
[1310.3s] which of which it established. It
[1312.4s] established and control what? Large
[1314.2s] numbers. Large numbers. Hallelujah.
[1315.9s] Jesus are controlling what? Large
[1318.1s] numbers through what? Education.
[1319.9s] Education. Are we together? Remember
[1322.1s] chapter what? Chapter 4 where there was
[1324.2s] a a tree and every beast was under that
[1327.1s] what that tree and every human being
[1329.7s] could find meat under what what that
[1331.6s] tree and we realize that that tree is
[1333.2s] the system of what education are we
[1335.4s] together so education is everything in
[1337.7s] other words you need to understand that
[1339.5s] in the world education is everything
[1342.0s] just like redemption education is done
[1343.7s] what it's everything so you find
[1345.4s] yourself in the worldly system of
[1347.0s] education no no redemption no
[1349.6s] redemption amen no sanctification of
[1352.8s] The church, are we together? The church
[1354.8s] cannot be sanctified with the Jesuit
[1357.0s] system of what? Education. Are we
[1359.2s] together? No sanctification.
[1361.7s] Hallelujah. Just say amen. Continue
[1364.2s] reading, brother Lloy. Every member of
[1366.2s] their order, every member of their order
[1368.6s] became a became a competent and a
[1371.5s] practical what? Teacher. So who are
[1374.0s] teachers in those school? Competent and
[1376.7s] practical teacher. Teacher. Are we
[1378.5s] together? So Jesus were teachers. So if
[1381.0s] you want to know that Jesus are teachers
[1382.6s] go to the next you want to see the
[1384.0s] methods of their teaching. So if this
[1385.6s] methods are in some system education
[1387.8s] know that you are being taught by Jesus
[1390.3s] and by that you are going to observe the
[1393.2s] popish word right together. However much
[1396.1s] you come and tell us you read to us
[1398.4s] first that is first Thessalonians where
[1400.6s] Paul is talking about great apostasy.
[1402.9s] Yeah. First Thessalonians chapter 2 that
[1404.8s] the coming of Christ shall not be before
[1406.5s] great what? Apostasy before man of what?
[1409.0s] Man of sin. If you come and preach man
[1411.1s] of sin then there's another way you are
[1413.0s] going to observe the rise of the man of
[1415.2s] sin in another form another form. So
[1417.0s] look at this. The following it says the
[1418.7s] following methods of teaching the
[1420.1s] following methods of teaching are
[1421.8s] characteristic of Jesus are
[1423.7s] characteristics of Jesus what? Schools.
[1426.2s] Are we together? Listen to
[1427.8s] characteristics of Jesuit what? School.
[1429.8s] So if you see a school today with this
[1431.4s] characteristics know that that papacy is
[1434.2s] destroying what? Protestantism. And if
[1436.3s] protesters are taking their children to
[1437.9s] that system, let us just understand that
[1440.2s] this reformation is going to do what? To
[1442.2s] fall. Hallelujah. We realize that what
[1444.7s] made the fall of the denomination in
[1447.3s] 1844 is that they never understood the
[1449.5s] true science of what? Education.
[1451.0s] Education. Hallelujah. And we are told
[1453.0s] that the condition of those Protestants
[1455.2s] is is is explained by the foolish what?
[1459.4s] Virgins. What were the foolish virgins
[1461.4s] lacking? Oil. The oil. Are we together?
[1464.2s] So a true science of education is an oil
[1467.1s] to the lamp. The lamp. If that oil is
[1469.8s] removed, the lamp must do what? Must
[1472.2s] die. Are we together? Even this church
[1474.2s] today, if that lamp is removed from the
[1477.0s] church, the church must die. The oil is
[1479.4s] removed from the lamp. If that oil is
[1481.1s] removed from the lamp, the church must
[1482.7s] do what? Do you know the reason why
[1484.5s] there's confusion in the church? There's
[1487.8s] no if there is no what? And and if there
[1490.9s] is oil, that oil is not pure. Are we
[1494.5s] together? That oil is still mixed with
[1496.7s] kerosene. Are we
[1498.2s] together? Still mix with some petrol.
[1500.6s] It's not pure. What? Pl. So there's
[1502.6s] going to be a confusion in the what?
[1505.8s] Continue reading. The following methods
[1507.3s] of teaching The following methods of
[1509.0s] teaching are characteristic of are
[1511.0s] characteristics of Jesuit school. The
[1513.0s] memory was cultivated. The memory was
[1514.7s] cultivated as a means of as a means of
[1517.8s] of keeping down reactivity of thought
[1519.9s] reactivity of thought and clearness of
[1522.2s] judgment and clearness of judgment. I
[1524.0s] don't understand that statement. Brother
[1525.6s] help me
[1527.2s] understand. Help me understand that
[1529.2s] statement. I would read because the
[1530.6s] memory was cultivated as a means of
[1532.5s] keeping down of reactivity of thought
[1534.5s] and clearness of judgment.
[1537.4s] Hey, these statements by these people
[1539.1s] are very difficult. Continue reading. I
[1541.8s] know we are going to understand the next
[1543.1s] statement will help us understand the
[1545.3s] other one. Continue. It says it says in

[1620.2s] powerful auxiliary in his teaching.

[1624.4s] be more honorable. Nothing will be more
[1626.3s] honorable in the Jesuit system of school
[1628.7s] than to outstrip a fellow student. To
[1631.0s] outstrip a fellow what?

[2025.7s] is time is so limited but let me read
[2027.8s] this for the seventh day Adventist in
[2030.2s] the last
[2031.2s] days. I'm still in studies on Christian
[2033.5s] education. I'm coming back to page page

[2077.8s] Attention. The three leading schools of
[2080.0s] the colonies. The three leading schools

[2084.1s] who had fled from the purple doctrine of
[2086.2s] the old world. Uh-huh. But but these
[2089.4s] educators Uhhuh. because of their
[2091.4s] training in this school. Because of
[2092.6s] their training in purple what? Schools.
[2094.8s] Schools. And their ignorance of the
[2096.6s] relation between education and religion
[2098.7s] unwittingly pardon their institution out

[2108.6s] reformers, these English reformers after
[2110.9s] sacrificing after sacrificing as they
[2113.6s] did for a worthy cause as they did for a
[2115.7s] worthy cause should yet allow our system

[2119.8s] of education so unfitted to all their
[2122.1s] purposes fitted to all their purposes be
[2124.3s] in reality to be in reality n of their
[2127.0s] children the n of their children on

[2130.6s] nourishment they did not realize that
[2133.5s] the character and the Christian
[2134.9s] experience of These children depended on
[2137.4s] what? Upon the nature of the food
[2139.2s] received. Uhhuh. Had they grasped the
[2141.2s] relation of education of the child to
[2143.4s] the experience of the same individual in
[2145.5s] the church, they would not have borrowed
[2147.4s] their purple system education but would
[2150.5s] have cast it out of bodily as too
[2153.7s] dangerous for tolerance. Within the
