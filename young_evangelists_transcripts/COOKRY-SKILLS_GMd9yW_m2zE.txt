FULL TRANSCRIPT:
shots. Go to me. Go with me to the book of child guidance. for maker in the kitchen. How many are women? Women inside the house. Ladies and women, of course. The high calling of the home maker. The homemaker in the kitchen. Who is the homemaker? Someone who makes the home. from the simple definition. Um I wanted to read something to the health and happiness of the whole family. Nothing is more vital than skill and intelligence of the part of the cook. There must be something called skill and intelligence. Cooking is not uh just going to the kitchen and beginning to prepare just like our old uh parents have done and we have done that is not cooking. Cooking we must learn on how to do them and uh you must have that intelligence. The science of cooking is not a small matter. The foundation of that which keeps people in health is the medical missionary work of good cooking. In the morning I heard someone saying that we should begin with building schools uh and sanitariums and all those uh and saying medical missionary work which is sanitarium. Let me tell us one thing. The work of cooking uh helpful presenting helpful meal before your uh household every day is a work of medical missionary work and uh that work is very important by the way medical what is medical missionary work it's the right arm of the gospel right it is an entering wage it is the um it is in the first second Angel's message it penetrates through the heart of the people so that the people may be able to receive the gospel. One of the things we use not everyone can be uh a nurse, not everyone can be can be able to minister to the sick. Not everyone can preach. But there are some people who can do uh good cooking and good cooking will be able to penetrate the hearts of men and women and they need be able to do what? To accept the gospel. Um one last thing I'm going to read. Scanty listen to this very carefully. Scanty incooked food deprivives the blood by weakening the blood making organs. I I need a hand being raised. What are the blood making organs? Anatomy and physiology. Ministry of healing says do not be a mother if you cannot understand the anatomy and physiology of the family members of your own. How can you minister to your own child or your husband or even yourself not understand how the body works or how the body has been built? Yeah. What is the blood making orans? Don't get where the blood is [Music] being right. So if you have prepared food, you're weakening where blood is made. And when the uh the place where the blood the blood is weakened do we have proper blood and when you don't have proper blood do you have proper circulation of blood and when there is no proper circulation of blood inherent and brings with acment bad tempers. The victim of thousands and tens of thousands of how many died of an abused stole when I can't get the page because it was telling us that almost everyone knows what makes our right gives us energy to be able to work every brain uh nerves or the liver in to be able to pump blood. They need water that is converted to blood and that bloods the be very well. So I finished my theory. We must know how to do well. Then say even if she says even if she was 40 years old she would even go to somewhere where she can learn how to because you have the life of your family in your hands your own life and the life of your family in your own heart of which cannot preach. when farmers go without being cooked well because the brain develop your brain develop well if the food you are eating is empty and ill prepared. Is it true? The reason why many people those who have flesh and those who have this fruit that has passions brings the why preachers they cannot preach the truth or the gospel that is uh that can sanctify their hearts is because they eating cannot make And when your plant is starting romantically, you don't have the brain not have the energy to lose the things you need or to grant the skins that the Lord wants to have. So today we don't have much. We only have some ingredients before us. How many put garlic in their homes? Maybe white garlic. You don't use maybe but now we can make a living from eaten. Women usually act and we we are about thness. We every day the same things uh and we give them that is not today back [Music] then. But they are being based on how to on how to score you it's not only cooking it. How many hours you can use the diet? So today simple to prepare very simple yellow. How many tasting yellow? It has that sweetness. We have more than 10. We have beautiful binding. We only going to use it very of course to maintain but because we don't have we going to use wheat for we have butter you can use if you like jewelry for sweetener and oil. You can use honey if you have you can use banana. Some people have lots of bananas in their homes. You can even porridge very sweet. So you can add banana used What did you eat? If you don't have a blender, you can grate the coconut. You can mash smash. Bananas are also smashed. But your mouth. I'd [Music] like you. Anybody? I just want to makes That's crazy. If you have can use the the lemon secretation of course if you're cooking this one can stay even for a week or two weeks. So you have lemon or ginger. Here we have three kinds of Thank you. Those are ridiculous. Okay. You can boil so that you may reduce the water to it. You can blend it the way I want to blend because of the Thank you. So 3 to one mobile. color. What is she? The next step. So we going to add salt here a little when you are baking oil is better if you don't I see people adding oil after they added the oil you want to mix with it now so it's better you add it So we think we have to have question. Thank you. Was it you have Yes. But I don't get some kind between [Music] How many things do you know that wishes. How many do you know that I wish country bridge? potatoes can be I hope you're seeing I'm going to Let's move. So, she has the lemon. We're going to add dry ingredients. Then after that now you're going to add this mix. You're at home just playing with things around. Of course, at first it won't be that perfect, but when you have things like Don't just cook for children. You cook until you don't for them and for them children. They love it so much. children very differently Not sure. What do you mean? in I think about something locally. Using sand. Okay. Yeah. You can use that in back. It's called manual. The one we use, but you can use you can use the the super. So you buy very stable. Yeah, [Music] So this this one is this is that we At least I'm with it and want to eat it. You don't put soft just like very soft. This [Music] one is best. Imagine How many even have people have been taught now and then people are calling teach us teach us but when they go back home they do the same things you want to be taught on how to do this on how to do this but when they go back someone told me teaching how to cook to then she was So at the end of the day when she went home she's taken one and a half without even trying to because she said I I don't even have time. It is so tires making that food. You see people want to be taught but they don't tell the effort. Sister wife says if you are a woman and you don't tell the to do that then you are destroying the life of what? very fast and then they they bring to the table and people have no time when you look there for several hours can agree they wasted right so if you can't do them it's better don't even go try to go just but at the end of the day because you need to avoid that. What's the substitute for me? Don't have that crush for spreading. You're going to spread the government. [Music] This is My phone need to find I'm going to spray it because we have a very small tree. It is only this one. So I'm not going to do the balls. Balls will take a lot of time. You're just going to spread it here then. You just spread I won't stretch. I'm batting them. You don't act like princess. Okay. What is talking about? That's for decoration. For decoration or anything like Yeah, sure. [Music] That is She does no more. That's come down. How long will it [Music] temperature? Jesus. time. Why don't you What I don't feel so between living and [Music] Yeah. And the inside it's always very well. But when you do this unlimited when you get it to behave science cannot raise because it cannot raise. So this is unleven and so the living the living one must be reb has to be reb so that the may [Music] but this one this one is sweeter and doesn't like but is also sweet. Awesome. Yeah. It is it cannot be digested. Go and read when you are when you're doing the raising bread raising bread. It doesn't digest well when it's soft. But that one I don't know so that we can reb again. When it re you rebel to do what is called Yes. No stain or noises should be me. When you're doing the she that one can stay for very long you reake it again it becomes fresh can even stay for a year that's a So we always it will become very hard because it because it has this The repeating of the yeast should be cut into moisture the moisture all traces of moisture from you can't bake it. Any other question? 3 2 1 [Music] 3iscal with this only have oils on the flour and want that taste of that sweet taste within orange. So at the end of the day, we have biscuit that is chilled and sweet. How long does it take? 20 30 days. But if you have manual, you won't keep checking. Keep check. Apart from which another which another of our bread? Yeah. when we like the one we do I think it's after tomorrow day after tomorrow we have [Music] orodium as much as we're doing it once. That is actually Fore speech. [Music] So, uh, I've used ash. I've used ash to make a sound. I've used to make it rise. So, both of them that should be living here if it must be alive. It must be alive because automatically when you placed it in warm water it will with some small amount of sweetener. has when it does not use the blood as a bind itself. A little bite. Yeah, we can use those. I've done my research. Someone told me plantain. Yeah. Yeah. He told me that that he needed one always from those who has it. [Music] for your duration. Just put some twists there. Oh, before you bring as simple as one more time. When are you going to put those ones? is very second. Anything else? No, it was confident. mater. By the way, what is the science of of long several be more surface area because I have some graphic surface. Yeah. The reason why you should do that. Perfect. We Why don't we take raw fruits and we take fruits? No. We take we take several Those who imply that I want to raise [Music] uh the start of the graen down. They need quite they need quite so that they can be exam. So for you to break them down which needs to be [Music] there. So you find out There's something called gra Right. For this to be broken down, the the dried grain for it to be turned back to grave has to go through this. And how how does it go through [Music] this heat and there is some What? That is how the grains. No, the fruits. How does the fruit become ripped? They are on the tree. They have the air and they have the sunlight. That is what makes the fruit go to be sweet. Okay. To have that is about the grape. By the raw fruit is not digestion in the end. Fruit or grain? Raw fruit or unripen. Yeah. And fruit. Yeah, that is what I unripened fruit. You must take something. It is not digested. It's like the raw brain is not digested. That is the same way I used to give those things from form of several months to return back to the process of heat and air breaks it down and returns it back to the grave for so that it may be easily digested in the body just like the fruits are easily digested when they are ripened. Right? So that is the science behind several things. It is not just the service. [Music] You are that oil is not supposed to be exposed to high degrees of heat and in the oven it is so hot and you not supposed to be exposed to fat and why And then you told her never to do so. I [Music] already bring our nature. really it's what happened at [Music] all. You have to the same. So there are different generated [Music] We need [Music] [Music] so that is all in You think there's some air so we reduce that That's basically why treated oil kinds of oil they treated hydrogen was a daughter never. So that question I think to do so I went and did some research on here. both hydrogenated which is supposed to be heated because first of all that hydrogenated the small smoke point is somehow high comparing all compressed ones and the effects of the heat is that he break down and form the energy which are harmful to our health and so it is like much more important if we have this congress We shouldn't expose it to heat. It will be much advised to hydrogenated. All of them have an effect because those bomb that they have whenever they're exposed to it they break down the breaking down the you know in chemistry. [Music] [Music] So the oil has when they heated they break down and they form free radically as the name is free and they are trying to say I don't know how oil is not like such a decision. It will also be dangerous looking even now to do it by the point and which is okay. So you understand I don't know it's it can just be okay as soon as it's ready. Yeah. Then you go back without testing how to make bread. Go and try it. somebody use the the can use any kind of question. [Music] But inside just for the end that And that is not that. Uh I know during the time this I mean uh maybe we can just he and then we will do research. It is very true. There are no so that we know you are talking. We shall pray. Thank you so much for the session. Thank you for the knowledge that you may give us able to work in your home and uh can't have good health yet. preaching one to close the s give us the strength to overcome the s in Jesus name. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[22.6s] shots. Go to me. Go with me to the book
[27.0s] of child guidance.
[31.0s] for maker in the kitchen.
[57.3s] How many are women? Women inside the
[60.5s] house. Ladies and women, of
[64.2s] course. The high calling of the home
[66.8s] maker. The homemaker in the kitchen. Who
[69.4s] is the
[73.2s] homemaker? Someone who makes the home.
[75.9s] from the simple
[77.6s] definition. Um I wanted to read
[83.6s] something to the health and happiness of
[86.2s] the whole family. Nothing is more vital
[89.1s] than skill and intelligence of the part
[91.9s] of the cook. There must be something
[95.3s] called skill and intelligence. Cooking
[99.1s] is not uh just going to the kitchen and
[103.0s] beginning to prepare just like our old
[105.9s] uh parents have done and we have done
[108.5s] that is not cooking. Cooking we must
[110.6s] learn on how to do them and uh you must
[115.4s] have that intelligence. The science of
[118.3s] cooking is not a small matter.
[123.7s] The foundation of that which keeps
[126.5s] people in health is the medical
[128.2s] missionary work of good cooking. In the
[131.0s] morning I heard someone saying that we
[133.7s] should begin with building schools
[137.2s] uh and sanitariums and all those uh and
[141.9s] saying medical missionary work which is
[144.7s] sanitarium. Let me tell us one thing.
[148.1s] The work of
[149.7s] cooking uh helpful presenting helpful
[153.8s] meal before your uh household every day
[158.6s] is a work of medical missionary
[161.2s] work and uh that work is very important
[165.3s] by the way medical what is medical
[167.4s] missionary work it's the right arm of
[169.1s] the gospel right it is an entering wage
[173.4s] it is the um it is in the first second
[177.8s] Angel's message it penetrates through
[181.4s] the heart of the people so that the
[183.9s] people may be able to receive the
[186.4s] gospel. One of the things we use not
[189.4s] everyone can be uh a nurse, not everyone
[193.4s] can
[195.2s] be can be able to minister to the sick.
[198.6s] Not everyone can preach. But there are
[200.9s] some people who can do uh good cooking
[204.6s] and good cooking will be able to
[207.2s] penetrate the hearts of men and women
[209.8s] and they need be able to do what? To
[211.7s] accept the
[213.0s] gospel.
[214.5s] Um one last thing I'm going to read.
[218.4s] Scanty listen to this very carefully.
[222.4s] Scanty incooked food deprivives the
[226.1s] blood by weakening the blood making
[228.8s] organs.
[230.4s] I I need a hand being raised. What are
[233.3s] the blood making
[238.9s] organs? Anatomy and physiology. Ministry
[242.4s] of healing says do not be a mother if
[245.4s] you cannot
[246.9s] understand the anatomy and physiology of
[249.9s] the family members of your own. How can
[253.6s] you minister to your own child or your
[256.6s] husband or even yourself not understand
[259.1s] how the body
[260.7s] works or how the body has been
[265.2s] built? Yeah. What is the blood making
[267.8s] orans?
[282.6s] Don't get
[286.7s] where the blood is
[287.6s] [Music]
[294.0s] being right. So if you
[299.2s] have prepared food, you're weakening
[302.9s] where blood is made. And when the uh the
[307.0s] place where the blood the blood is
[309.8s] weakened do we have proper
[312.5s] blood and when you don't have proper
[315.2s] blood do you have proper circulation of
[317.0s] blood and when there is no proper
[319.1s] circulation of
[321.7s] blood
[328.1s] inherent and
[330.4s] brings with acment
[334.6s] bad tempers. The victim
[338.0s] of thousands and tens of thousands of
[341.7s] how
[343.0s] many
[346.9s] died of an
[349.1s] abused
[352.4s] stole when
[374.5s] I can't get the page
[376.1s] because it was telling us
[379.7s] that almost everyone
[382.1s] knows what makes our
[386.4s] right gives us energy to be able to work
[391.6s] every brain
[394.1s] uh nerves
[396.2s] or the liver in to be able to pump
[400.5s] blood. They need
[404.9s] water that is converted to blood and
[408.7s] that bloods
[410.6s] the
[412.1s] be very well.
[417.2s] So I finished my
[420.6s] theory. We must know how to do well.
[424.4s] Then say even
[432.9s] if she says even if she was 40 years old
[436.8s] she would even go to somewhere where she
[439.6s] can learn how
[442.5s] to because you have the life of your
[445.8s] family in your hands your own life and
[449.0s] the life of your family in your own
[451.4s] heart of which cannot preach.
[455.7s] when farmers go without being cooked
[461.4s] well
[463.4s] because the brain develop your brain
[466.9s] develop well if the food you are eating
[470.2s] is empty and ill
[472.8s] prepared. Is it true?
[476.2s] The reason why many people those who
[478.9s] have flesh and those who
[483.3s] have this
[485.2s] fruit that has
[489.9s] passions
[492.2s] brings the why preachers they cannot
[495.8s] preach the truth or the gospel that is
[498.4s] uh that can sanctify their hearts is
[502.2s] because they eating cannot make
[507.0s] And when your plant is starting
[509.2s] romantically, you don't
[511.4s] have the brain not have the energy
[518.8s] to lose the things you need or to
[523.9s] grant the skins that the Lord wants to
[527.1s] have. So
[528.8s] today we don't have much. We only have
[536.2s] some ingredients before us. How many put
[539.4s] garlic in their homes? Maybe
[542.4s] white
[544.9s] garlic. You don't
[548.1s] use maybe but
[551.9s] now we can make a
[561.4s] living from eaten.
[567.0s] Women usually
[574.0s] act and we we are about thness.
[580.3s] We every day the same things
[583.8s] uh and we give them that is
[590.7s] not
[592.8s] today back
[603.0s] [Music]
[607.2s] then. But they are being based on how to
[610.8s] on how to score you it's not
[614.8s] only cooking it.
[629.8s] How many hours
[647.4s] you can
[651.7s] use the
[657.5s] diet? So today simple to prepare very
[669.9s] simple
[673.9s] yellow. How many tasting yellow? It has
[677.4s] that
[682.1s] sweetness. We have more than 10.
[687.9s] We have beautiful binding. We only going
[691.3s] to use it
[696.0s] very of
[700.0s] course to maintain but because we don't
[704.4s] have we going to use wheat
[707.8s] for we
[709.7s] have
[711.6s] butter you can
[713.6s] use if you
[715.9s] like jewelry
[720.6s] for
[721.6s] sweetener and oil. You can use honey if
[725.6s] you
[727.6s] have you can use banana. Some people
[731.0s] have lots of bananas in their homes.
[744.9s] You can even
[748.5s] porridge very sweet. So you can add
[752.4s] banana used
[771.4s] What did you eat?
[783.9s] If you don't have a blender, you can
[788.4s] grate the coconut. You can mash
[794.0s] smash. Bananas are also smashed.
[803.5s] But your mouth.
[807.8s] I'd
[810.7s] [Music]
[825.5s] like
[829.9s] you. Anybody?
[868.9s] I just want to
[885.7s] makes
[907.1s] That's crazy.
[964.7s] If you
[966.9s] have can use the the lemon
[972.7s] secretation of course if you're
[975.9s] cooking this one can stay even for a
[978.9s] week or two
[982.3s] weeks. So you have lemon or
[986.5s] ginger. Here we have three kinds of
[1017.8s] Thank
[1031.5s] you.
[1042.0s] Those are ridiculous.
[1081.6s] Okay. You can boil so that you may
[1085.7s] reduce the water to it.
[1088.6s] You can blend it the way I want
[1091.2s] to
[1093.9s] blend
[1095.6s] because of the
[1112.9s] Thank you.
[1162.4s] So 3 to
[1164.6s] one mobile.
[1187.8s] color.
[1210.1s] What is she?
[1238.3s] The next
[1254.0s] step. So we going to add
[1257.4s] salt
[1259.2s] here a
[1261.3s] little when you are
[1263.8s] baking oil is better if you
[1271.4s] don't I see people adding oil after they
[1277.1s] added the oil you want to mix with it
[1279.8s] now so it's better you add it
[1286.6s] So we think
[1291.8s] we have
[1293.3s] to
[1303.8s] have question.
[1312.5s] Thank
[1323.7s] you.
[1327.2s] Was it you have
[1348.8s] Yes. But
[1359.1s] I don't
[1376.8s] get some kind
[1378.9s] between
[1423.1s] [Music]
[1425.5s] How many things do you know that
[1432.6s] wishes.
[1442.5s] How many do you know
[1464.0s] that I wish country bridge?
[1469.9s] potatoes can be
[1488.5s] I hope you're seeing I'm going
[1492.6s] to
[1497.8s] Let's move.
[1511.6s] So, she has the
[1513.3s] lemon. We're going to add dry
[1516.2s] ingredients.
[1539.0s] Then after that now you're going to add
[1540.8s] this mix.
[1568.6s] You're at home just playing with things
[1570.4s] around. Of course, at first it won't be
[1572.6s] that
[1573.4s] perfect, but when you have things like
[1577.7s] Don't just cook for
[1579.9s] children. You cook
[1582.9s] until you
[1588.5s] don't for them and for
[1591.7s] them
[1594.8s] children. They love it so much.
[1629.2s] children very differently
[1633.3s] Not sure.
[1637.8s] What do you mean?
[1659.4s] in
[1666.0s] I think about something locally.
[1676.2s] Using sand. Okay. Yeah. You can use that
[1680.8s] in
[1687.0s] back. It's called
[1690.0s] manual. The one we
[1692.4s] use, but you can use you can use the the
[1698.4s] super. So you buy very stable.
[1717.0s] Yeah,
[1756.5s] [Music]
[1759.4s] So this this one is this
[1762.0s] is that we At least
[1768.8s] I'm with it and want to eat it.
[1776.7s] You don't put
[1788.0s] soft just
[1791.7s] like very
[1793.7s] soft. This
[1798.7s] [Music]
[1802.7s] one is
[1821.5s] best. Imagine
[1854.7s] How many even have
[1858.4s] people have been
[1860.8s] taught now and then people are calling
[1863.4s] teach us teach us but when they go back
[1865.7s] home they do the same things
[1870.6s] you want to be taught on how to do this
[1872.5s] on how to do this but when they go back
[1875.6s] someone told me teaching how to cook to
[1879.1s] then she was So at the end of the day
[1881.4s] when she went home she's taken one and a
[1884.7s] half without even trying to because she
[1888.2s] said I I don't even have time. It is so
[1892.2s] tires making that food. You see people
[1896.0s] want to be taught but they don't tell
[1899.4s] the effort. Sister wife says if you are
[1901.9s] a woman and you don't tell the to do
[1904.0s] that then you are destroying the life of
[1906.4s] what?
[1908.9s] very
[1911.6s] fast and then they they bring to the
[1915.0s] table and people have no time when you
[1918.5s] look
[1920.4s] there for several hours can agree they
[1925.1s] wasted right
[1929.9s] so if you can't do them it's better
[1933.7s] don't even go
[1937.9s] try to go
[1940.2s] just but at the end of the day because
[1943.4s] you
[1962.8s] need to avoid that.
[1967.8s] What's the substitute
[1970.1s] for me?
[2011.4s] Don't have that crush for
[2014.5s] spreading. You're going to spread the
[2016.5s] government.
[2017.4s] [Music]
[2019.3s] This is
[2023.1s] My
[2026.6s] phone need to find
[2073.4s] I'm going to spray it because we have a
[2075.9s] very small tree. It is only this one. So
[2079.6s] I'm not going to do the balls. Balls
[2082.2s] will take a lot of time. You're just
[2083.8s] going to spread it here
[2089.0s] then. You just spread
[2110.6s] I won't stretch.
[2162.0s] I'm batting them.
[2166.7s] You don't act like princess.
[2179.9s] Okay.
[2193.6s] What
[2215.6s] is talking about?
[2228.2s] That's for decoration.
[2230.6s] For decoration or anything like
[2243.0s] Yeah, sure.
[2270.2s] [Music]
[2276.0s] That is
[2294.0s] She does no more.
[2297.9s] That's come down.
[2305.4s] How long will it
[2312.7s] [Music]
[2328.4s] temperature? Jesus.
[2343.8s] time.
[2386.8s] Why don't you
[2405.5s] What I don't feel
[2422.8s] so
[2424.8s] between living and
[2436.9s] [Music]
[2438.2s] Yeah. And the inside it's always
[2443.4s] very well. But when you do
[2446.1s] this unlimited when you get it to behave
[2450.6s] science cannot raise because it cannot
[2455.2s] raise.
[2458.3s] So this is unleven
[2461.0s] and so the living the living one must be
[2463.8s] reb
[2466.7s] has to be reb so that the may
[2470.3s] [Music]
[2473.4s] but this
[2475.2s] one this one is sweeter
[2479.8s] and
[2483.4s] doesn't like but is also sweet.
[2491.0s] Awesome.
[2493.8s] Yeah.
[2501.9s] It is it cannot be digested. Go and
[2507.2s] read when you are when you're doing the
[2513.0s] raising bread raising bread.
[2516.0s] It
[2517.2s] doesn't
[2519.0s] digest well when it's soft.
[2536.6s] But that
[2545.1s] one I don't
[2554.8s] know so that we can reb again.
[2562.0s] When
[2563.7s] it re you rebel to do what is called
[2582.7s] Yes. No stain or noises should be me.
[2586.8s] When you're doing the
[2589.4s] she that one can stay for very long
[2593.2s] you reake it again it becomes
[2596.2s] fresh can even stay for a year
[2604.4s] that's a
[2617.0s] So we always
[2629.3s] it will become very hard because it
[2632.8s] because it has this
[2637.1s] The repeating of the yeast should be cut
[2643.6s] into moisture the moisture all traces of
[2647.6s] moisture
[2652.4s] from you can't bake
[2659.2s] it. Any other question?
[2670.5s] 3 2 1
[2682.0s] [Music]
[2688.0s] 3iscal with this
[2699.8s] only have oils on the
[2704.4s] flour and want that taste of that sweet
[2711.3s] taste within orange.
[2716.6s] So at the end of the day, we have
[2718.9s] biscuit that is chilled and sweet.
[2728.9s] How long does it take?
[2732.6s] 20 30 days.
[2736.6s] But if you have manual, you won't keep
[2739.8s] checking. Keep
[2741.7s] check. Apart
[2744.1s] from which another which
[2749.2s] another of our bread? Yeah. when
[2753.7s] we like the one we do I think it's after
[2758.3s] tomorrow day after tomorrow we have
[2765.4s] [Music]
[2767.0s] orodium
[2799.2s] as much as we're doing it once.
[2809.6s] That is
[2827.6s] actually Fore speech.
[2835.2s] [Music]
[2848.5s] So, uh, I've used ash.
[2853.5s] I've used ash to make a sound. I've used
[2860.1s] to make it rise.
[2862.4s] So, both of them
[2874.9s] that should be living
[2878.0s] here if
[2883.2s] it must be alive. It must be alive
[2885.3s] because automatically when you placed it
[2888.3s] in warm water it will with some small
[2892.4s] amount of sweetener. has when it does
[2897.2s] not
[2906.8s] use the blood as a
[2922.9s] bind itself.
[2928.2s] A little bite.
[2931.8s] Yeah, we can
[2935.1s] use those.
[2944.6s] I've done my research. Someone told me
[2961.7s] plantain. Yeah.
[2980.7s] Yeah. He told me that that he
[2984.8s] needed one
[2986.8s] always from those
[2990.0s] who has it.
[2992.8s] [Music]
[2995.7s] for
[2997.2s] your duration. Just put some
[3002.3s] twists there.
[3020.8s] Oh, before you bring
[3034.3s] as simple
[3049.6s] as one more time.
[3054.6s] When are you going to put those ones?
[3071.2s] is
[3083.1s] very second.
[3095.0s] Anything else?
[3112.4s] No, it was confident.
[3144.2s] mater. By the way, what is the science
[3146.3s] of
[3148.1s] of
[3150.2s] long several be
[3160.1s] more surface area
[3163.1s] because I have
[3165.6s] some
[3173.5s] graphic surface.
[3184.2s] Yeah. The reason why
[3187.7s] you should do that. Perfect. We Why
[3191.4s] don't we take raw fruits and we take
[3194.9s] fruits?
[3196.4s] No. We
[3201.1s] take we take several
[3206.2s] Those who imply that I want to raise
[3223.9s] [Music]
[3248.8s] uh the start of the
[3252.4s] graen down. They need quite they need
[3258.3s] quite so that they can
[3261.6s] be exam.
[3265.2s] So for you
[3267.9s] to break them
[3270.7s] down which needs to
[3275.6s] be
[3279.2s] [Music]
[3284.4s] there. So you find out
[3300.4s] There's something called gra
[3307.7s] Right.
[3322.5s] For this to be broken
[3325.0s] down, the the
[3328.0s] dried grain for it to be turned back to
[3332.2s] grave has to go through this. And how
[3335.5s] how does it go through
[3341.6s] [Music]
[3347.1s] this heat and there is some
[3360.8s] What? That is how the
[3363.6s] grains. No, the
[3366.8s] fruits. How does the fruit
[3371.2s] become
[3372.8s] ripped? They are on the tree. They have
[3377.1s] the air and they have the sunlight. That
[3380.6s] is what makes the fruit go to be sweet.
[3383.5s] Okay. To have that is about the grape.
[3387.2s] By the raw fruit is not digestion in the
[3390.0s] end.
[3392.6s] Fruit or grain? Raw fruit
[3395.9s] or unripen. Yeah. And fruit. Yeah, that
[3400.2s] is what I unripened fruit. You must take
[3408.9s] something. It is not digested.
[3412.2s] It's like the raw brain is not digested.
[3414.9s] That is the same
[3418.8s] way
[3424.8s] I used to give those things from
[3434.1s] form
[3436.9s] of several months to return back to the
[3441.3s] process of heat and air breaks it down
[3445.7s] and returns it back to the grave for so
[3448.6s] that it may be easily digested in the
[3451.3s] body just like the fruits are easily
[3453.4s] digested when they are ripened. Right?
[3456.2s] So that is the science
[3457.9s] behind several things. It is not just
[3463.0s] the service.
[3475.2s] [Music]
[3489.0s] You are that oil is not supposed to be
[3491.7s] exposed
[3493.6s] to high degrees of heat and in the oven
[3498.6s] it is so
[3502.0s] hot and
[3504.5s] you not supposed to be exposed to
[3509.2s] fat
[3510.8s] and why And then you told her never to
[3515.7s] do so.
[3541.3s] I
[3550.8s] [Music]
[3558.2s] already bring our nature.
[3570.7s] really
[3573.3s] it's what happened at
[3584.2s] [Music]
[3588.0s] all. You have to
[3601.0s] the
[3604.4s] same. So there are
[3609.1s] different generated
[3612.9s] [Music]
[3626.9s] We need
[3631.5s] [Music]
[3638.3s] [Music]
[3644.9s] so that is all in
[3659.0s] You think there's some air so we
[3671.9s] reduce
[3675.4s] that That's
[3679.7s] basically why treated
[3682.4s] oil kinds of oil they treated
[3692.8s] hydrogen
[3703.2s] was a daughter never.
[3709.6s] So that question I
[3713.2s] think to do
[3732.0s] so I went and did some research on here.
[3738.5s] both hydrogenated which is supposed to
[3741.9s] be heated because first of all that
[3746.2s] hydrogenated the small smoke point is
[3749.4s] somehow high comparing all compressed
[3752.0s] ones and the effects of the heat is that
[3755.8s] he break down and form the energy which
[3759.1s] are harmful to our health and so it is
[3762.0s] like much more important if we have this
[3764.4s] congress
[3765.2s] We shouldn't expose it to heat. It will
[3767.4s] be much
[3778.1s] advised to hydrogenated. All of them
[3781.6s] have an effect because those bomb that
[3784.0s] they have whenever they're exposed to it
[3785.8s] they break down
[3792.6s] the breaking down the you know in
[3795.8s] chemistry.
[3797.1s] [Music]
[3802.6s] [Music]
[3804.2s] So the oil has when they heated they
[3808.6s] break down and they form free
[3815.3s] radically as the name is free and they
[3824.3s] are trying to
[3830.0s] say I don't know how
[3845.2s] oil
[3848.0s] is not
[3856.1s] like such a decision. It will also be
[3861.3s] dangerous looking
[3866.1s] even
[3870.1s] now to do it
[3876.4s] by the point and which is okay. So
[3882.9s] you understand
[3892.6s] I don't know it's
[3894.9s] it can just be okay
[3901.0s] as soon as it's ready.
[3904.9s] Yeah. Then you go back without testing
[3907.5s] how to make bread. Go and try it.
[3911.9s] somebody use
[3913.5s] the
[3915.4s] the can use any kind
[3919.3s] of question.
[3926.6s] [Music]
[3943.0s] But inside just
[3952.3s] for
[3966.9s] the end that
[3971.2s] And that
[3978.8s] is not that.
[3981.8s] Uh I know during the time this I
[3989.6s] mean uh maybe we can
[3995.6s] just
[4002.0s] he and then we will do research. It is
[4004.9s] very true. There are
[4008.2s] no so that we
[4015.9s] know you are talking.
[4022.1s] We shall pray.
[4033.2s] Thank you so much for the
[4036.3s] session. Thank you for the
[4039.1s] knowledge that you
[4042.1s] may give us able to work
[4053.5s] in your home and uh can't have good
[4057.8s] health yet. preaching one to close the
[4061.6s] s give us the strength to overcome the s
[4065.2s] in Jesus name. Amen.
