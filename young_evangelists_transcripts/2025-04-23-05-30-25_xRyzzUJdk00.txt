FULL TRANSCRIPT:
have to expand your brain and think broadly to do that for you to receive the seal of God, then you need to be established upon the truth that you cannot be moved. That is the sealing message. But now for you to be sanctified because the Bible says in John 17:17 that sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is what? Thy word is true. So men are sanctified by the word of God. But now brethren and sisters listen to the book of Maranatha page 231 is not in my slides. I told you that not everything is given in the slides. Many times you stand in the pulpit and God brings things for you to teach. But again you have to prepare for your lesson. Now the book of Marana page 231 if someone is there let me read 231 oh let's turn to paragraph number this is paragraph number four I think 231 paragraph 4 sure [Music] the tradication Now listen that true sanctification is a Bible word that's stop from there. Now what is true sanctification is Bible doctree. So until you understand the true Bible doctree you can be sanctified. What about if you don't understand what is true Bible doctree? It is very difficult for you to be sanctified. Now what says that true sanctification is a Bible docty. Then it says the Bible clearly teaches what sanctification is and how it is to be attained. Sanctify them through truth. Thy word is true. And Paul teaches that believers are to be sanctified by the word. Are you saying that is what I'm teach that believer and to be sanctified by who? By the Holy Ghost. What is believe that's a question that she asks? Jesus told when he speak personality when he is Christ a personality does Christ have a personality? Yes. Does Christ have a spirit, a body? Henceforth is a personality. Does God have a spirit? Does God have a spirit, a body? Yes, the person. What about angels? Does angels have spirit? A body. Hence, angels are apostles. What about the Holy Spirit? Does the Holy Spirit have a spirit? Now she says what is the work of the Holy Spirit? Jesus told his disciples when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into what John 16:3 I think now Jesus tell his disciples that when spirit of truth comes this spirit of truth will guide you into what what truth now brothers if we study the Bible and easy quotations. I've never seen where God has just sent the spirit itself to come and open the not to reveal to prophets or even apostles. And I think they have been looking about even William Miller who had led William Miller to study the Bible. You are looking never read. Let's turn to the Bali writings. Which page is that? Honey writings. Which page is that? I'm forgetting the page about William. Can someone check it? Oh, that's the story about William is in which page Think the teacher who was handling church heritage can help us. Is he around? Is he around? Let's check page 263. No, it is not page 263 page. It is page 81. Really? Let's see. 229. Yeah, sure. Page 229. Thank you. The quotation was like what? Yeah. Paragraph number one. It reads [Music] it. Now listen. Christ says one when he the spirit of truth is come he shall lead you into all what. Now listen when God is reliving uh revealing messages to this farmer called Miller. Now God is sending who? Who is God sending? But what did Christ say about the spirit of truth? That he will come and lead men into all truth. But now when I went right, he said that God sent his angel to move upon the heart of a farmer who had not believed the Bible to lead him to search the prophecies. Angels of God repeatedly visit visited that chosen one to guide his mind and open his understanding prophecies which had never been dark to God's people. The commencement of the chain of truth was given to him. Now when God reveals me to Luke, God send his angel. But now Christ says that when he the spirit of truth is come, he shall lead men into truth. But now here we see that who is leading Miller into the truth to study the scriptures and to open to him the Bible. Whom did God send? But Christ said that who was supposed to come? The spirit of what? The spirit of truth. Now you need to understand a close connection between the spirit and the angels. If you don't understand, then brother tell you you're going to be confused. Turn to the book of Ezekiel. The book of Ezekiel chapter number 11:4. Ezekiel Ezekiel chapter 11. The verse is verse 24. Now listen, let me begin from verse 4 first, then I jump to verse 24. Rather, the Bible says, "Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, oh son of man." Then verse 5 says, "And the spirit of the Lord fell upon me." Now listen, Ezekiel says, "And the spirit of the Lord upon me and said unto me," how you explain that verse to a trinitarian who believe that there's a person called God the Holy Spirit and you believe that the spirit is not a person. Is that what you believe? That is what you believe. You don't believe in trinity. You believe that there's one God the father. Then Jesus Christ the son of God. Then you believe that this the spirit of God which is the spirit of the father and the son. But now the Bible says and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said unto me speak. Now who is saying? Who is saying it is the spirit saying? Do we understand that verse? Who is saying? Who is speaking in that verse? Who is speaking? Listen, I told you my English is not that broad. But understand what the Bible says. The Bible says, "And the spirit of the Lord fell upon me and said unto me, who is speaking? And the spirit of fell upon me and said unto me and evangelist came to the pulpit and spoke to the church members who was speaking. It is another it is he that was speaking. Now when the of the fell upon me and he said who is speaking and the spirit of the Lord fell upon me said unto me speak the Lord. Who is speaking? Someone saying the Lord the spirit said that the Lord is reporting. Is that true? I know I'm speaking to men who have gone to universities and colleges and some of it from four and I've done I don't know linguistics and lage and what the Bible says spirit of the lord be upon me and said unto me speak the spirit speak the lord that have said oh house of Israel for I know the things that come into your mind everyone of them. Now brother, when you want to understand the Bible, I told you last time, you wish to look at the context of which the Bible is speaking because many of the trinitarians will use this part to prove you that the spirit is a person being turn to Ezekiel chapter 2, especially the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel chapter 2 verse number two. The Bible says, "And the spirit entered into me and when he spake unto me and said me upon my feet that I heard him that spake to me another spirit. Which spirit was taking their prophets to vision? Which spirit was taking the prospect to vision? It's a question you have to ask yourself. Which spirit was that? Understand the book of revelation. Turn to your Bibles. Turn to your Bibles. I told you much of the Bible. The Bible as the only creed. You need to form your doctrine from the Bible. Brother and sisters, before you go to EG, understand what the Bible speaks. are written from the Bible. The book of Revelation chapter number 17. Let's begin from verse one. The Bible says, "There came one of the seven angels which had seven vials and talked with me, saying unto me, come hither, I will show you unto thee the judgment of the great who that siteth upon many waters." Now he's coming to John here. Who has come to John? It is an angel. Then verse three says, so he who carried him in the spirit, it is an angel. Now the Bible says in verse three, so he carried me away in the spirit into death. So which spirit had carried John into the wilderness? Brethren, turn to the book of Hebrews. Is someone being confused? No, don't be confused. It is very simple. Turn the book of Hebrews, chapter 1:14. Hebrews 1:14. The Bible reads, the Bible says, "And are they not all ministering?" Oh, let's begin from verse 13. Says, "But to which of the angel said he at any time, sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot?" Then verse 14 says these angels still the Bible still speaks of these angels in verse 14. Are they not all ministering spirits? Now which spirit had carried Ezel to vision? It is angel. Thank you. How when Ezekiel said, "And that spirit spake unto me, thus say the Lord, it was not the Holy Spirit that was speaking literally, but it was an angel speaking to who?" To his angel, but now angels don't speak their own words, but they speak what belongs to the father. When they are endured with the Holy Spirit of them, angels don't come down with their own messages. They come down with what they had given from the father. Are we together? Now you have to you have to understand the context of the spirit in the Bible because someone will still confuse you. Let's take an example in the book of Isaiah chapter 59. You need to understand how the Bible explains itself. Turn to the book of Isaiah chapter 59 the vers number 19. It's a verse that many of us always read. The Bible say are you there? If you are there say amen. Are you there? You know some come to devotion without even carrying their Bibles. Now they stare at you. What is this man saying? Also some come to sleep. I'm not like the other. Look this boy is sleeping. Now the Bible says in verse 19 of chapter 59 of Isaiah. So are we there? The Bible says, "So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and its glory from the rising of the sun. When the king shall come like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up the standard against what?" Against him. the spirit of the Lord shall lift up the standard against him. Now the Bible says that that person that is going to lift up the standard against him is what the spirit. Now turn to the quotations of Eite in for a man. You understand how was explaining herself. If you want to understand quotations, this is the principles. Let the quotations be the key to unlock another quotation. Then stick firm on the Bible verse principle. Amen. The book form that is manuscript releases volume 4 page 158. Let's check page 158. Then I think it's paragraph 4. form that is manuscript releases volume 4 page 158 paragraph number four. Now listen the Bible says in Isaiah which read in 59:1 19 so shall they appear the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood. The spirit of the Lord shall lift up the standard against what? Against him. Now listen to what EG says. You place yourself in positions and in a society of those who bring temptation upon you. And that is why God is giving us messages of country living to go and stay far away from the cities. Who can be a Christian in the city? Who can be a Christian in the city? There's none. Can ever cheat yourself that you can be a Christian in the city? Very impossible. Now the Bible the says you place yourself in positions and in a society of those who bring temptation upon what? Upon you. And you do not always resist temptation. But the first decided resistant will bring angels your side to strengthen you. When you present your petitions to God for help, an angel lift up the standard for you against the enemy in order that you may not be overcome. Who is lifting? Who is lifting up the stand? Standards. But now Isaiah says when the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of what? The Lord shall lift up the standard against you. But now I says that when sister and brother and children who are listening to me when present petitions to God for help an angel was white drunkard were writing an angel. No are they not all ministering spirits. Now she says that when you present your petitions to to God for hell, an angel lift up the standard for you against what? The enemy in order that you may not be over overcome. That spirit that was taking the reference to see vision was angels. But now listen, as we come back to our laptops and projector that looked at yesterday, let's check this one here. Yeah, this one says that the great office work of what? The Holy Spirit is distinctly specified by our savior. Now, she says that it is the office work of the Holy Spirit. It is not the Holy Spirit itself. But this one is an office work. She speaks of an office work. Can I give you example? When governor says, I know many of you like crying for governors in your area. Then we tell the governor that governor is we vote for you and we know Christians should never take part in such things. But now just example man come and tell that man was saying that you go and vote. No even if you vote your vote will be of none effect to the governor. Now we start crying for the governor and tell the governor you know our place is leaking and we we need help from you. Then the governor says I will come and fix that thing. Then tomorrow he will see the governor wearing overall and gamuts and carrying hammers to come and fix it. Is that the thing? But the governor is going to send his office the delegates who are working with the name of that office. Is that true? Another example maybe those who work in the market places let me say like market the seages are everywhere then the governor says no don't worry brethren and sisters I will come and fix that thing but the governor says no just wait I will send my office there to fix what that thing are you with Thank you. Let me tell you another example. The president says literally the president seeing us but he says that I'm seeing you just miss there teaching things that are not there. I'm seeing you. Is the president seeing us? But why does he say he's seeing us? He has delegates in that office that are giving information to what? To him. Now she said that the great of his work of the Holy Spirit is distinctly specified by our savior and when he is come he will reprove the word of God. See Christ knew that this announcement was a wonderful truth to understand the great of his work of the holy spirit was a wonderful tool. So if you don't understand the of his work of the holy spirit then you are going to be lost. you are going to be still a trinitarian. He was nearing the close of his ministry upon this earth and he was standing in view of the cross with a full realization of the lot of guilt that was to be placed upon him as a sin bearer. Yet his greatest anxiety was for his disciples. He was speaking to find a solace for them and he told them nevertheless I will tell you the truth. It is expedient for me for for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you. But if I depart, I will send him what? And you remember quotation. No one can grab the spirit of what? Another. We want the Holy Spirit, which Jesus Christ. Listen, brethren, harmonizing the quotations to page 337, paragraph 1. Jesus comes to you as the spirit of truth. Study the mind of the spirit. Consult your lord. Follow his way. If you will to the dictates of the mind and flesh, your spirit will lose its proper character and balance. And if you fail to discern and cannot appreciate moral power, then you will seek to carry out the maxims of worldlings. Leave alone that. Check this one. Still harmonizing in sermons and talks volume 2 page 136 paragraph number six. The Lord says what this because he knows it is for our good. He will build a wall around us. The Lord will build what? A wall around us to keep us from transgression so that his blessing and love may be bestowed on us in rich measure. This is the reason we have established a school here. Listen, the Lord instructed us that this was the place in which we should locate and we have every reason to think that we are in the right what place. We have been brought together as a school. Now listen what she says that we have been together as what? As a school. Then we need to realize that the Holy Spirit who is what? As much a person as God is a person is walking through these what grounds unseen by human eyes. Now this person is walking in these grounds but unseen by what? Human eyes. That the Lord is our keeper and our helper. He hears every word we Christ says that he Christ only knows of four personalities. But now what? He says that the Holy Spirit is much a person as God is a person is doing what? He's walking. How? You need to understand how is some of you see this say where this thing was. No. She says that the Holy Spirit who is much a person as God is a person is walking through this what grounds and seen by what human eyes that the Lord is our keep and helper. He hears now again this Holy Spirit does a what a and he does what? He hears every word we are we utter and knows every thought of the m the mind. Are we together? Don't worry it is very easy to understand. Now listen again this quotation will bring confusion. She says in 7 BC 986 paragraph 10, all heaven is interested in our salvation. The angels of God are walking up and down the streets of these cities and marking the deeds of men. Now turn back to this quotation. She says that the Holy Spirit who is much a person as God is a person is working on what this grounds and think by human eyes that the Lord is our keep and helper. He hears every word we ut and knows every thought of the mind. Now listen to this one again. She speaks in review September 6 of 1890 that all heaven is interested in our salvation. The angels of walking up and down of these cities and matching the deeds of what? Now he's walking who is walking it is the Holy Spirit or angels. No no no brother told you not everything is the phone. That is the book H. I want to give you three quotations and then tell me who is walking. So that when you meet someone telling you you see what says the Holy Spirit who is imaging tell him no what about angels now how many people are walking on this earth. If Christ is walking angels are walking holy spirit is walking. Now when angels are walking, what is the work of the Holy Spirit and how is he working? Now turn to a minister of healing. Page 107. Page 107. This page 107 or 207? Let me check. 107 paragraph 3. Yeah, 107 paragraph number two. She says today no curious multitudes flock to the desert places to see and hear Christ. Are we together? That today no curious multitude flock to the desert places to see and hear who the Christ. His voice is not heard in the busy street. No Christ comes from the wayside. Jesus of passes by. She says yet this word is true today. Now listen brother and sister. Today no curious multitude flow to the desert places to see and hear what Christ his voice is not heard in the busy streets no Christ from the wayside Jesus of Nazareth passed by yet this word is true to them Christ walks and sin what what how many are walking now the Holy Spirit is working angels walking Christ walking unseen. How many are walking? Now prove how many are walking? How many are walking? Now listen. He says rather she yet this word is true today. Christ walks and seen through our street with messengers of merc. He comes to our homes with all who are seeking to minister in his name. He waits to cooperate. He is the He is in the midst of us to heal and to bless if we will receive him. Christ walking and sins, angels walking, the Holy Spirit is walking. Now brother, let me ask you a question. When Christ is walking, if Christ is walking, literally you say that he is walking, he's walking and sin, who is now pleading for us in heaven? Who will be pleading for us? If Christ comes down and start walking and you see he's walking here Christ is walking he's unseen. No, how is he walking? Turn to the book of Matthew chapter 25. Listen this I told you this is the most easiest topic to handle than even health. See health you need to study a lot of anatomy and physiology and look at bones and I don't know fibul I don't know synovial fluid no this is direct from the scriptures very easy to understand the book of Matthew chapter 25 are in Matthew chapter 25 then let's turn to verse 31 the bible says when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him. Then he shall sit upon the throne of his what? Of his glory. And before him shall be gathered all nations, and he shall separate them one from another as shepher divideth his sheep from the goats. Ask yourself, where do you want to belong? Sheep or goat? Sheep or goat? Sheep or goat? Sheep. Amen. Who is the lamb of God? Christ himself. Verse 33 says, "And he shall take the sheep on the right hand on the right hand." So those who are going to be glorious and who are going to overcome sin will be upon the right hand of who? Of God. When Christ had overcome, where was he? Sitting at the right hand side of God. Verse 33 says, "And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goat on the what? The left. Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of what? The world, for I was hungered and he gave me meat. I was thirsty and he gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. Listen, Christ is saying that you who are sitting on my right hand come this kingdom belongs to you from the foundation of the earth. Now he says that when I cry was done what? Was hungry and he gave me meat. When I was thirsty and he gave me drink. I was a stranger and he took me in. Naked and he clothed me. I was sick and he visited me. I was in prison and he came unto me. What Christ? What are you saying? You are in prison. Or do you think the saints will not be like what? Where were you in prison? In verse 37 he says then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when so we thee and hungered what Christ you were hungered somewhere one day I never saw you I think when sister will be there we'll be asking such a question what what are you saying Christ I thought you are bleeding for us in heaven and now you say you are and I've never seen anywhere and they will then they will say Then shall the Russian answer saying, Lord, when so we thee and hungered and fed thee all thirst and gave thee drink, when so we arrange and took thee in all naked and clothe thee, or when so the sick or in prison, and came unto thee, and the king shall answer and say unto them, verily, verily I say unto you, in as much as ye have done unto one of the least of these, my brethren, you have done it unto me. How is Christ walking? How is Christ walking? How is Christ walking? That if you have just done a charity work to someone who was in need, then that thing you did to who was Christ at that time walking? Yes. in the person of that person that you had to help. Turn to the book of Acts. I want you to understand. Turn to the book of Acts chapter 9. The book of Acts chapter 9. Are you in the book of Acts chapter 9? If you are there, say amen. The book of Acts chapter 9 verse number three says this is Saul and as he journeyied he came near Damascus and and suddenly there shine round about him a light from heaven and he fell on the earth and had a voice saying unto him soul soul why persecutest thou me? Who is speaking to Saul? Then Christ says, "Saul, Saul, why was Saul chasing Christ with pangas and swords?" Who was soul persecuting? Was Christ at that time walking on the grounds of earth? Was he walking? How? Through human agencies. Thank you, brother. You have used a nice English. through the human agency he was walking. Now he says, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou? Me?" Now listen verse five. And he said, "Who art thou, Lord?" And the Lord said, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks." Now Jesus tells him, "No, it is me who thou perse Christ." What we read this in the night when the teacher of prophets was presenting that Christ was persecuted in the person of what? His saints, his people. Was Christ walking? Yes. But now Christ was not walking literally from heaven. But those who are imbued by the spirit of Christ when we when they persecuted and those who persecute them are persecuting Christ himself. Because when we receive the spirit of Christ, it is now Christ dwelling in us. Now Paul says that it is not I that live but who liveth in me. Amen. Yeah. Paul says that it is not me that now live. But now that life that is in me is the life of who? Christ. Now when he persecuted that person is not persecuting because of me I no longer lives but now Christ lives in me and when he persecutes me he persecute the owner of the is Christ himself. Now says that that word is still true because Christ still walks and seen. He can walk and sin through the person of his saints. He can walk and sin through his ministers. Now when a minister comes to your home to visit you and then you chase that minister away, whom are you chasing away? Whom are you chasing away? And then one day Christ was telling you that you know one day I came to your home and you just chased me away or what Christ did you come to my home I never saw you. No Christ is with us still in the person of his people. When I'm speaking here, I'm not speaking I myself, but I'm speaking I'm representing Christ himself. Listen this. We read last time when trials overshadow the soul. Remember the words of Christ. Remember that his unseen presence in the person of what? In the person of what? The Holy Spirit. 16 paragraph 2 is some quotation that last time. While Jesus minister in the heavenly above, he is still by his spirit the minister of church on what? On earth. How is Christ with us? Through his spirit. Listen to 70 page 273 paragraph 1. As the divine endorment, the power of the Holy Spirit was given to the disciples. So it will today be given to all who seek a right. This power alone is able to make us wise unto salvation and to fit us for the courts above. Christ want us to Christ want to give us a blessing that will make us holy. These things have I spoken unto you says that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full. Joy in the Holy Spirit is healing. Giving lifegiving joy. In giving us his spirit, God gives us what is God giving us another God. But in giving us his spirit, God gives us what? himself. Now when we receive the spirit of God, we receive God himself. But now in the person of what? His spirit making himself a fountain of divine influence to give health and life to the world. Turn to the book of John chapter 14. I'm coming to the book of Acts. Then I finish up my study. My time is also coming to coming to an end. The book of which book? John chapter 14. Are you in chapter 14 of John? Yeah. Verse 23. The Bible says, "Jesus answered and said unto them, if a man love me, he will keep what? My words. And my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our body with him." How is that possible? Will God the Father come and be in our stomachs? Then Christ also come and say in our stomachs. How are they with us? By the spirit. Even when it says by God giving us his spirit, God gives us what? Himself. That's the end of my study. Say amen. No. Turn to your Bible. That is not the end of my study. Turn to your Bible. in the book of okay the book of acts chapter 5 the last verse I think we'll continue the book of acts chapter 5 I wanted you to realize the connection between the holy spirit and angels amen so that you understand when I say that the Holy Spirit is much a person as God is a person is walking this grounds. Then another place he says that angels of God are moving up and down in our streets. Then what did she mean? We need to understand how does God brings blessings to us is something that we need to understand because there are some ministries who teach something that is very weird. You see our prayers goes to God through osmosis. You know what is osmosis? When you pray your prayers just go to God through osmosis. They just go. You know what is osmosis? Those who those who are privileged to reach from two from one it just moves slowly from where it is concentrated slowly. That is what people teach. Now listen to the book of acts 5:20. Then I finish up 5:20 says, let's begin from verse 19. But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said, who say? Who spake? The angel. He said what? Go stand and speak in the temple to the people or the words of what? Who is speaking there? Do you want to do you want to know what says about this verse? 1888 materials. Open 1888 materials. My last quotation 1547 paragraph 2. Now who is speaking here? But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said, "Go stand and speak to the temple to the people all the words of this world. Who has just commanded these people to speak?" The angels turn to 1888 materials. I've said which paid 1547 sorry paragraph number two listen brother sister she says but let us follow the history of the men whom the Jewish priests and rulers thought so dangerous because they were bringing in new and strange teaching on almost every theological subject that is the same as us today. You stand and teach people and people think that what what are you teaching that is not Adventism? See it says the command given by the Holy Spirit. What listen who gave the command in the Bible? But now in reports and tell us and she's not speaking her words but she's speaking what she's given by who? By God. She says the command given by the Holy Spirit, go stand and speak in the temple to the people. All the words of this life was obeyed by the apostles. Who gave the command? It is the Holy Spirit or the angel. Who gave the command? Who gave the command? Says the command was given by the Holy Spirit. The Bible says an angel. Now, how is that possible? How does the Holy Spirit speaks? I want to stop from there. How does the Holy Spirit walks and see? How does it speaks yet? It doesn't have a mouth and legs and hands. But the Bible says Egypt says and the Holy Ghost gave the command. We will still be looking at quotations in Egypt. There was a prophet in the book of verse called Agabas and the Bible has used him many times to explain how the holy spirit said but now may God help us understand as tomorrow we shall continue from there so we understand the office work of the holy spirit they are delegates who works in that office amen then don't believe some strange doctrines that our prayers goes to god through osmosis I don't know which ministry is that teaching that I've s ministries you know you just pray and your prayers come from the father through osmosis and then they are answered hey what's that man we shall look the ministration of all angels how do our prayers goes to the father you have to go back to Jacob's what Jacob's what learn and understand may God bless us all in Jesus name let's pray. We thank your precious father in heaven for this wonderful morning. We have opened thy word. You have led us. I myself am a weak vessel, not worthy to stand before thy people to present thy word. that because of thy mercies upon my life, you still grant me chances to teach thy word. How I pray that you help all of us God that indeed we need to know they are right and we need to be sanctified. We really facing much troubles as youths but this year you have called us to make a decision by our own self to serve thee. Help us to decide to serve thee as the only true God. Help us to decide that at the end of this convention, Father, we might go back and study our Bibles and understand who you are. Right? Give us the spirit of loving thy word. Give us the spirit of loving to study that father we may be build upon the platform of eternal truth. Thank you for the women who are kneeling down here, the men, the old men, the young men, the children. Give us strength, Father, that in these days of atonement, we might look upon our lives that where we are still not worthy, we may be afflicted and come to true repentance that Father, we may live a holy life. May you plant a spirit of hating sin in our life that we hate sin and don't love only righteousness. The duties of this day we commit upon your hand. Help us in everything. We know your presence is here and you are walking here with us. And each and every word we utter, each and every thought we we think of that is not worthy of thee, Father, we know you are noting them down through the ministration of the he angels. Help us to check our paths while thy spirit is leading us to only do the things which are right before thee. We pray that they will prevail as we are making decisions. Father, as youths, help us not to make decisions out of excitement of these truths. But help us to be convicted of the truth in the Bible. That as we come out of this convention, you may say that indeed this is the truth from the Bible. Because you know, after this, we are going to face persecutions. We are going to be separated from our friends. Those who are clinging upon are going to leave us and run away from us. But you know that when you are convicted of thy truth, we know that you are going to be with us. Guide each and every youth who is listening unto thy voice, the children. Father, help us. Provide for us ways. We know you promise us in the Bible that when we believe thy truth and when we are convicted of thy truth and decide to walk in the truth, you are going to provide ways for us to live in this earth. Let all prevail as we claim upon daily unto thy promises is our prayer by faith in Jesus holy name. Amen.

[5.8s] the seal of God, then you need to be
[8.9s] established upon the truth that you
[11.0s] cannot be
[12.1s] moved. That is the sealing message. But
[15.4s] now for you to be sanctified because the
[18.5s] Bible says in John
[20.6s] 17:17 that sanctify them through thy
[23.8s] truth, thy word is what? Thy word is
[27.4s] true. So men are sanctified by the word
[31.0s] of God. But now brethren and sisters
[33.7s] listen to the book of
[35.4s] Maranatha page 231 is not in my slides.
[38.6s] I told you that not everything is given
[40.6s] in the
[41.5s] slides. Many times you stand in the
[44.0s] pulpit and God brings things for you to
[47.2s] teach. But again you have to prepare for
[49.8s] your lesson. Now the book of Marana page
[59.2s] 231 if someone is there let me read
[66.5s] 231
[69.8s] oh let's turn to paragraph number this
[71.8s] is paragraph number four I think 231
[74.9s] paragraph 4 sure
[76.8s] [Music]
[78.0s] the
[79.6s] tradication Now listen that true
[83.6s] sanctification is a Bible word that's
[86.9s] stop from there. Now what is true
[90.0s] sanctification is Bible doctree. So
[93.2s] until you understand the true Bible
[95.5s] doctree you can be
[97.6s] sanctified. What about if you don't
[99.9s] understand what is true Bible
[102.8s] doctree? It is very difficult for you to
[105.3s] be sanctified. Now what says that true
[108.6s] sanctification is a Bible
[111.7s] docty.
[113.3s] Then it says the Bible clearly teaches
[117.4s] what sanctification is and how it is to
[119.4s] be
[122.0s] attained. Sanctify them through truth.
[125.4s] Thy word is true. And Paul teaches that
[128.7s] believers are to be sanctified by the
[133.6s] word. Are you saying that is what I'm
[138.6s] teach that
[140.8s] believer and to be sanctified by
[143.8s] who? By the Holy Ghost. What is believe
[149.0s] that's a question that she asks? Jesus
[152.1s] told when he speak personality when he
[157.5s] is Christ a personality does Christ have
[160.5s] a
[161.6s] personality? Yes. Does Christ have a
[165.4s] spirit, a body? Henceforth is a
[169.2s] personality. Does God have a
[172.0s] spirit? Does God have a spirit, a body?
[176.9s] Yes, the person. What about angels? Does
[180.2s] angels have spirit? A
[183.2s] body. Hence, angels are apostles. What
[186.6s] about the Holy Spirit? Does the Holy
[189.1s] Spirit have a spirit?
[198.9s] Now she says what is the work of the
[201.3s] Holy Spirit? Jesus told his disciples
[204.2s] when he the spirit of truth is come he
[207.4s] will guide you into what John 16:3 I
[212.8s] think now Jesus tell his disciples
[216.5s] that when spirit of truth
[220.6s] comes this spirit of truth will guide
[224.0s] you into what what
[227.7s] truth now brothers if we study the Bible
[232.0s] and easy quotations. I've never seen
[235.2s] where God has just sent the spirit
[238.0s] itself to come and open the not to
[242.4s] reveal to prophets or even
[246.3s] apostles. And I think they have been
[248.3s] looking about even William Miller who
[251.3s] had led William Miller to study the
[256.8s] Bible. You are looking never read. Let's
[260.4s] turn to the Bali writings. Which page is
[262.2s] that?
[268.8s] Honey
[276.8s] writings. Which page is that? I'm
[278.9s] forgetting the
[281.2s] page about
[285.6s] William. Can someone check it?
[307.7s] Oh,
[318.4s] that's the story about William is in
[321.0s] which page
[322.1s] Think the teacher who was handling
[324.3s] church heritage can help us. Is he
[326.2s] around? Is he
[327.6s] around? Let's check page
[335.3s] 263. No, it is not page
[338.7s] 263
[342.3s] page. It is page 81.
[346.4s] Really? Let's see. 229. Yeah, sure. Page
[350.2s] 229. Thank
[351.5s] you. The quotation was like
[355.6s] what? Yeah. Paragraph number one. It
[359.0s] reads
[362.9s] [Music]
[364.2s] it. Now
[366.0s] listen. Christ says one when he the
[369.0s] spirit of truth is come he shall lead
[372.1s] you into all what.
[375.0s] Now listen when God is reliving uh
[378.2s] revealing messages to this farmer called
[380.9s] Miller. Now God is sending
[383.7s] who? Who is God
[386.0s] sending? But what did Christ say about
[388.9s] the spirit of
[390.1s] truth? That he will come and lead men
[393.0s] into all truth. But now when I went
[396.4s] right, he said that God sent his angel
[398.6s] to move upon the heart of a farmer who
[401.4s] had not believed the Bible to lead him
[404.7s] to search the prophecies. Angels of God
[407.9s] repeatedly visit visited that chosen one
[411.0s] to guide his mind and open his
[413.5s] understanding prophecies which had never
[415.7s] been dark to God's people. The
[418.5s] commencement of the chain of truth was
[420.4s] given to him.
[423.9s] Now when God reveals me to
[427.7s] Luke, God send his
[430.4s] angel. But now Christ says that when he
[433.4s] the spirit of truth is come, he shall
[435.5s] lead men into truth. But now here we see
[438.4s] that who is leading Miller into the
[440.4s] truth to study the scriptures and to
[443.0s] open to him the Bible. Whom did God
[447.2s] send? But Christ said that who was
[449.5s] supposed to come?
[453.0s] The spirit of what? The spirit of truth.
[456.9s] Now you need to understand a close
[459.9s] connection between the spirit and the
[464.2s] angels. If you don't understand, then
[466.6s] brother tell you you're going to be
[467.8s] confused. Turn to the book of
[470.3s] Ezekiel. The book of
[473.9s] Ezekiel chapter number 11:4.
[482.8s] Ezekiel Ezekiel chapter
[487.0s] 11. The verse is verse
[490.1s] 24. Now
[492.0s] listen, let me begin from verse 4 first,
[494.6s] then I jump to verse 24. Rather, the
[497.2s] Bible says, "Therefore prophesy against
[500.9s] them. Prophesy, oh son of man." Then
[504.1s] verse 5 says, "And the spirit of the
[507.3s] Lord fell upon me." Now listen, Ezekiel
[511.5s] says, "And the spirit of the
[514.3s] Lord upon me and said unto
[519.2s] me," how you explain that verse to a
[522.7s] trinitarian who believe that there's a
[524.3s] person called God the Holy Spirit and
[527.2s] you believe that the spirit is not a
[529.8s] person. Is that what you believe?
[534.9s] That is what you believe. You don't
[537.3s] believe in trinity. You believe that
[539.6s] there's one God the father.
[541.8s] Then Jesus Christ the son of God. Then
[545.5s] you believe that this the spirit of God
[548.2s] which is the spirit of the father and
[550.7s] the son. But now the Bible says and the
[554.2s] spirit of the lord fell upon me and said
[557.9s] unto me speak. Now who is
[562.9s] saying? Who is
[566.0s] saying it is the spirit
[568.7s] saying? Do we understand that verse? Who
[571.2s] is saying? Who is speaking in that
[573.2s] verse? Who is
[575.6s] speaking? Listen, I told you my English
[578.4s] is not that broad. But understand what
[580.5s] the Bible says. The Bible says, "And the
[583.8s] spirit of the Lord fell upon me and said
[586.2s] unto me, who is speaking?
[594.3s] And the spirit of fell upon me and said
[597.8s] unto me and evangelist came to the
[601.8s] pulpit and spoke to the church members
[604.6s] who was speaking. It is
[609.6s] another it is he that was speaking. Now
[612.9s] when the of the fell upon me and he said
[616.5s] who is
[620.8s] speaking and the spirit of the Lord fell
[623.5s] upon me said unto me
[626.9s] speak the Lord. Who is speaking? Someone
[630.0s] saying the Lord the spirit said that the
[634.5s] Lord is
[639.8s] reporting. Is that true?
[644.0s] I know I'm speaking to men who have gone
[646.1s] to universities and colleges and some of
[648.4s] it from four and I've done I don't know
[651.0s] linguistics and lage and what the Bible
[655.1s] says spirit of the lord be upon me and
[658.1s] said unto me speak the spirit
[662.4s] speak the lord that have said oh house
[666.3s] of Israel for I know the things that
[668.7s] come into your mind everyone
[671.7s] of them. Now brother, when you want to
[674.6s] understand the Bible, I told you last
[677.3s] time, you wish to look at the context of
[681.0s] which the Bible is
[682.6s] speaking because many of the
[684.6s] trinitarians will use this part to prove
[686.7s] you that the spirit is a person
[692.3s] being turn to Ezekiel chapter 2,
[694.9s] especially the book of Ezekiel.
[699.4s] Ezekiel chapter
[701.8s] 2 verse number
[706.4s] two. The Bible says, "And the spirit
[709.9s] entered into me and when he spake unto
[713.2s] me and said me upon my feet that I heard
[717.2s] him that spake to me another
[721.8s] spirit. Which spirit was taking their
[725.7s] prophets to vision?
[728.1s] Which spirit was taking the prospect to
[730.6s] vision? It's a question you have to ask
[732.4s] yourself. Which spirit was
[737.1s] that? Understand the book of
[740.2s] revelation. Turn to your Bibles. Turn to
[743.5s] your Bibles. I told you much of the
[745.6s] Bible. The Bible as the only
[748.4s] creed. You need to form your doctrine
[751.4s] from the Bible. Brother and sisters,
[753.5s] before you go to EG, understand what the
[756.4s] Bible speaks.
[759.2s] are written from the
[761.6s] Bible. The book of Revelation chapter
[764.5s] number
[765.4s] 17. Let's begin from verse one. The
[767.8s] Bible says, "There came one of the seven
[770.7s] angels which had seven vials and talked
[774.4s] with me, saying unto me, come hither, I
[778.0s] will show you unto thee the judgment of
[780.3s] the great who that siteth upon many
[783.1s] waters."
[785.1s] Now he's coming to John
[787.7s] here. Who has come to John? It is an
[791.1s] angel. Then verse three says, so he who
[795.4s] carried him in the
[798.2s] spirit, it is an angel. Now the Bible
[801.7s] says in verse three, so he carried me
[804.3s] away in the spirit into death. So which
[808.1s] spirit had carried John into the
[811.0s] wilderness?
[817.6s] Brethren, turn to the book of
[819.7s] Hebrews. Is someone being
[822.5s] confused? No, don't be confused. It is
[825.0s] very simple. Turn the book of Hebrews,
[827.3s] chapter
[833.8s] 1:14. Hebrews 1:14.
[837.4s] The Bible
[839.1s] reads, the Bible says, "And are they not
[843.2s] all
[844.3s] ministering?" Oh, let's begin from verse
[846.8s] 13. Says, "But to which of the angel
[849.9s] said he at any time, sit on my right
[853.4s] hand until I make thine enemies thy
[855.8s] foot?"
[859.0s] Then verse 14 says these angels still
[862.0s] the Bible still speaks of these angels
[863.8s] in verse 14. Are they not all
[867.3s] ministering
[869.1s] spirits? Now which spirit had carried
[872.2s] Ezel to
[873.8s] vision? It is angel. Thank
[879.8s] you. How when Ezekiel said, "And that
[882.5s] spirit spake unto me, thus say the Lord,
[885.2s] it was not the Holy Spirit that was
[887.0s] speaking literally, but it was an
[889.6s] angel speaking to
[891.7s] who?" To his
[894.5s] angel, but now angels don't speak their
[897.4s] own words, but they speak what belongs
[900.3s] to the father. When they are endured
[902.2s] with the Holy Spirit of
[904.4s] them, angels don't come down with their
[907.3s] own messages.
[909.0s] They come down with what they had given
[911.5s] from the
[913.5s] father. Are we
[916.1s] together? Now you have to you have to
[918.4s] understand the context of the spirit in
[920.3s] the
[921.2s] Bible because someone will still confuse
[924.5s] you. Let's take an example in the book
[927.4s] of Isaiah chapter
[929.5s] 59. You need to understand how the
[933.2s] Bible explains itself.
[936.4s] Turn to the book of Isaiah chapter 59
[939.4s] the vers number 19. It's a verse that
[941.4s] many of us always read. The Bible say
[944.2s] are you there? If you are there say
[947.3s] amen. Are you there? You know some come
[949.7s] to devotion without even carrying their
[951.4s] Bibles. Now they stare at you. What is
[953.4s] this man
[955.9s] saying? Also some come to sleep. I'm not
[959.4s] like the
[960.4s] other. Look this boy is sleeping. Now
[963.8s] the Bible says in verse 19 of chapter 59
[967.2s] of
[967.9s] Isaiah.
[969.4s] So are we
[971.3s] there? The Bible says, "So shall they
[975.1s] fear the name of the Lord from the west
[978.5s] and its glory from the rising of the
[981.0s] sun. When the king shall come like a
[984.1s] flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[987.1s] up the standard against
[989.0s] what?" Against him. the spirit of the
[991.9s] Lord shall lift up the standard against
[994.8s] him. Now the Bible says that that person
[998.2s] that is going to lift up the standard
[1000.0s] against him is
[1002.0s] what the spirit. Now turn to the
[1005.4s] quotations of Eite in for a man. You
[1010.1s] understand how was explaining herself.
[1014.0s] If you want to understand quotations,
[1016.9s] this is the principles. Let the
[1019.4s] quotations be the key to unlock another
[1024.3s] quotation. Then stick firm on the Bible
[1027.1s] verse
[1028.5s] principle.
[1030.2s] Amen. The book
[1032.4s] form that is manuscript releases volume
[1038.7s] 4 page
[1040.8s] 158. Let's check page
[1044.3s] 158. Then I think it's paragraph 4.
[1050.9s] form that is manuscript releases volume
[1054.8s] 4 page
[1057.3s] 158 paragraph number four. Now listen
[1060.2s] the Bible says in Isaiah which read in
[1063.4s] 59:1 19 so shall they appear the name of
[1065.8s] the Lord from the west and his glory
[1068.8s] from the rising of the sun when the
[1071.1s] enemy shall come in like a flood. The
[1073.1s] spirit of the Lord shall lift up the
[1075.0s] standard against what? Against him. Now
[1077.5s] listen to what EG says. You place
[1080.0s] yourself in positions and in a society
[1083.3s] of those who bring temptation upon
[1085.9s] you. And that is why God is giving us
[1088.4s] messages of country
[1091.2s] living to go and stay far away from the
[1093.9s] cities. Who can be a Christian in the
[1096.4s] city? Who can be a Christian in the
[1098.8s] city? There's none. Can ever cheat
[1101.8s] yourself that you can be a Christian in
[1103.1s] the city? Very impossible.
[1106.2s] Now the Bible the says you place
[1109.5s] yourself in positions and in a society
[1112.2s] of those who bring temptation upon what?
[1115.0s] Upon
[1116.0s] you. And you do not always resist
[1119.6s] temptation. But the first decided
[1122.7s] resistant will bring angels your side to
[1125.9s] strengthen you.
[1128.2s] When you present your petitions to God
[1130.5s] for help, an angel lift up the standard
[1135.3s] for you against the enemy in order that
[1138.7s] you may not be overcome. Who is lifting?
[1141.8s] Who is lifting up the stand?
[1144.3s] Standards. But now Isaiah says when the
[1147.7s] enemy shall come in like a flood, the
[1149.7s] spirit of
[1150.8s] what? The Lord shall lift up the
[1155.2s] standard against you. But now I says
[1158.8s] that when sister and brother and
[1161.1s] children who are listening to me when
[1163.5s] present petitions to God for help an
[1167.8s] angel was white drunkard were writing an
[1171.7s] angel.
[1174.0s] No are they not all
[1176.9s] ministering spirits.
[1180.0s] Now she says that when you present your
[1182.4s] petitions to to God for hell, an angel
[1186.2s] lift up the standard for you against
[1189.4s] what? The enemy in order that you may
[1192.1s] not be over
[1194.9s] overcome. That spirit that was taking
[1198.1s] the reference to see vision was
[1201.2s] angels. But now listen, as we come back
[1203.6s] to our laptops and
[1205.5s] projector that looked at yesterday,
[1208.0s] let's check this one here.
[1210.2s] Yeah, this one says that the great
[1212.3s] office work of what? The Holy Spirit is
[1215.6s] distinctly specified by our savior. Now,
[1219.1s] she says that it is the office work of
[1221.7s] the Holy
[1223.2s] Spirit. It is not the Holy Spirit
[1226.0s] itself. But this one is an office work.
[1228.5s] She speaks of an office work. Can I give
[1232.1s] you example? When governor says, I know
[1235.4s] many of you like crying for governors in
[1237.2s] your area.
[1239.8s] Then we tell the governor that
[1242.4s] governor
[1244.0s] is we vote for you and we know
[1246.6s] Christians should never take part in
[1247.8s] such things. But now just example
[1250.0s] man come and tell that man was saying
[1252.2s] that you go and vote. No even if you
[1254.6s] vote your vote will be of none effect to
[1256.7s] the
[1257.8s] governor. Now we start crying for the
[1260.5s] governor and tell the governor you know
[1261.9s] our place is leaking and we we need help
[1264.2s] from you. Then the governor says I will
[1267.5s] come and fix that thing. Then tomorrow
[1271.6s] he will see the governor wearing overall
[1274.0s] and gamuts and carrying hammers to come
[1276.6s] and fix it. Is that the
[1280.2s] thing? But the governor is going to send
[1282.6s] his office the delegates who are working
[1286.5s] with the name of that office. Is that
[1289.4s] true? Another example maybe those who
[1292.2s] work in the market places let me say
[1293.8s] like market the seages are everywhere
[1297.6s] then the governor says no don't worry
[1299.4s] brethren and sisters I will come and fix
[1302.2s] that
[1309.0s] thing but the governor says no just wait
[1311.5s] I will send my office there to fix what
[1315.0s] that
[1317.6s] thing are you with
[1325.5s] Thank
[1326.4s] you. Let me tell you another example.
[1329.1s] The president
[1338.4s] says literally the president seeing
[1342.9s] us but he says that I'm seeing you just
[1346.2s] miss there teaching things that are not
[1349.1s] there. I'm seeing you. Is the president
[1352.2s] seeing
[1353.2s] us? But why does he say he's seeing us?
[1356.9s] He has delegates in that office that are
[1359.4s] giving information to what? To
[1362.6s] him. Now she said that the great of his
[1366.4s] work of the Holy Spirit is distinctly
[1368.5s] specified by our savior and when he is
[1370.7s] come he will reprove the word of God.
[1373.1s] See Christ knew that this announcement
[1375.4s] was a wonderful
[1377.3s] truth to understand the great of his
[1379.9s] work of the holy spirit was a wonderful
[1381.8s] tool. So if you don't understand the of
[1384.1s] his work of the holy spirit then you are
[1385.6s] going to be lost. you are going to be
[1387.5s] still a
[1390.4s] trinitarian. He was nearing the close of
[1392.6s] his ministry upon this earth and he was
[1395.2s] standing in view of the cross with a
[1397.5s] full realization of the lot of guilt
[1399.6s] that was to be placed upon him as a sin
[1401.6s] bearer. Yet his greatest anxiety was for
[1404.1s] his disciples. He was speaking to find a
[1406.3s] solace for them and he told them
[1408.4s] nevertheless I will tell you the truth.
[1410.1s] It is expedient for me for for you that
[1412.6s] I go away. For if I go not away, the
[1415.3s] comforter will not come unto you. But if
[1418.3s] I depart, I will send him what? And you
[1421.4s] remember quotation. No one can grab the
[1424.2s] spirit of what? Another. We want the
[1427.6s] Holy Spirit,
[1429.5s] which Jesus Christ. Listen, brethren,
[1433.2s] harmonizing the quotations to page 337,
[1435.8s] paragraph 1. Jesus comes to you as the
[1438.2s] spirit of truth. Study the mind of the
[1440.2s] spirit. Consult your lord. Follow his
[1442.9s] way. If you will to the dictates of the
[1445.6s] mind and flesh, your spirit will lose
[1447.5s] its proper character and
[1449.4s] balance. And if you fail to discern and
[1451.9s] cannot appreciate moral power, then you
[1454.4s] will seek to carry out the maxims of
[1456.6s] worldlings. Leave alone
[1458.8s] that. Check this one. Still harmonizing
[1462.6s] in sermons and talks volume 2 page 136
[1466.7s] paragraph number six. The Lord
[1469.2s] says what this because he knows it is
[1473.0s] for our good. He will build a wall
[1475.5s] around us. The Lord will build what? A
[1478.3s] wall around us to keep us from
[1480.3s] transgression so that his blessing and
[1483.2s] love may be bestowed on us in rich
[1486.0s] measure. This is the reason we have
[1488.0s] established a school here. Listen, the
[1491.3s] Lord instructed us that this was the
[1493.5s] place in which we should locate and we
[1497.0s] have every reason to think that we are
[1499.2s] in the right what place. We have been
[1502.3s] brought together as a school. Now listen
[1504.2s] what she says that we have been together
[1507.0s] as what? As a school. Then we need to
[1510.7s] realize that the Holy Spirit who is
[1513.2s] what? As much a person as God is a
[1516.6s] person is walking through these what
[1519.5s] grounds unseen by human
[1522.8s] eyes. Now this person is walking in
[1525.3s] these grounds but unseen by what? Human
[1528.1s] eyes. That the Lord is our keeper and
[1529.7s] our helper. He hears every word
[1534.0s] we Christ says that he Christ only knows
[1537.6s] of four personalities. But now what? He
[1540.3s] says that the Holy Spirit is much a
[1542.1s] person as God is a person is doing
[1544.4s] what? He's walking.
[1546.8s] How? You need to understand how is some
[1550.7s] of you see this say where this thing
[1553.2s] was.
[1555.1s] No. She says that the Holy Spirit who is
[1559.2s] much a person as God is a person is
[1561.8s] walking through this what grounds and
[1564.7s] seen by what human eyes that the Lord is
[1568.4s] our keep and helper. He hears now again
[1571.1s] this Holy Spirit does a what a and he
[1575.8s] does
[1577.6s] what? He hears every word we are we
[1581.8s] utter and knows every thought of the m
[1585.4s] the
[1588.3s] mind. Are we
[1590.4s] together? Don't worry it is very easy to
[1595.0s] understand. Now listen again this
[1597.5s] quotation will bring confusion. She says
[1600.7s] in 7 BC 986 paragraph 10, all heaven is
[1604.6s] interested in our salvation. The angels
[1607.3s] of God are walking up and down the
[1610.3s] streets of these cities and marking the
[1613.0s] deeds of men. Now turn back to this
[1615.7s] quotation. She says that the Holy Spirit
[1618.5s] who is much a person as God is a person
[1620.7s] is working on what this
[1624.6s] grounds and think by human eyes that the
[1627.7s] Lord is our keep and helper. He hears
[1630.1s] every word we ut and knows every thought
[1632.6s] of the mind. Now listen to this one
[1634.4s] again. She speaks in review September 6
[1638.0s] of
[1639.0s] 1890 that all heaven is interested in
[1642.8s] our salvation. The angels of walking up
[1646.6s] and down of these cities and matching
[1648.7s] the deeds of what? Now he's
[1652.2s] walking who is walking it is the Holy
[1655.7s] Spirit or
[1658.0s] angels. No no no brother
[1661.8s] told you not everything is the phone.
[1663.2s] That is the book
[1665.1s] H. I want to give you three quotations
[1668.1s] and then tell me who is
[1672.4s] walking. So that when you meet someone
[1674.8s] telling you you see what says the Holy
[1677.8s] Spirit who is
[1679.0s] imaging tell him no what about angels
[1682.1s] now how many people are walking on this
[1683.8s] earth. If Christ is walking angels are
[1686.8s] walking holy spirit is walking. Now when
[1689.7s] angels are walking, what is the work of
[1691.2s] the Holy Spirit and how is he working?
[1694.0s] Now turn to a minister of healing. Page
[1700.2s] 107. Page
[1703.9s] 107. This page 107 or 207? Let me check.
[1708.2s] 107 paragraph
[1710.6s] 3. Yeah, 107 paragraph number two. She
[1715.8s] says today no curious multitudes flock
[1719.2s] to the desert places to see and hear
[1721.4s] Christ. Are we together? That today no
[1724.6s] curious multitude flock to the desert
[1726.5s] places to see and hear who the Christ.
[1729.4s] His voice is not heard in the busy
[1731.3s] street. No Christ comes from the
[1733.8s] wayside. Jesus of passes by. She says
[1737.9s] yet this word is true
[1740.8s] today. Now listen brother and sister.
[1744.0s] Today no curious multitude flow to the
[1746.6s] desert places to see and hear what
[1749.6s] Christ his voice is not heard in the
[1752.2s] busy streets no Christ from the wayside
[1755.8s] Jesus of Nazareth passed by yet this
[1759.0s] word is true to them Christ walks and
[1763.3s] sin
[1765.2s] what what how many are walking
[1769.3s] now the Holy Spirit is working angels
[1773.0s] walking Christ walking unseen. How many
[1776.2s] are walking? Now prove how many are
[1780.3s] walking? How many are
[1783.0s] walking? Now listen. He says rather she
[1787.3s] yet this word is true today. Christ
[1789.3s] walks and seen through our street with
[1792.0s] messengers of merc. He comes to our
[1794.1s] homes with all who are seeking to
[1796.3s] minister in his name. He waits to
[1798.3s] cooperate. He is the He is in the midst
[1800.7s] of us to heal and to bless if we will
[1803.7s] receive him. Christ walking and sins,
[1807.2s] angels
[1808.4s] walking, the Holy Spirit is walking. Now
[1811.8s] brother, let me ask you a question. When
[1813.8s] Christ is walking, if Christ is walking,
[1817.4s] literally you say that he is walking,
[1819.3s] he's walking and sin, who is now
[1820.6s] pleading for us in
[1824.7s] heaven? Who will be pleading for us?
[1828.3s] If Christ comes down and start walking
[1830.2s] and you see he's walking here Christ is
[1831.8s] walking he's unseen. No, how is he
[1839.1s] walking? Turn to the book of Matthew
[1841.4s] chapter
[1842.4s] 25. Listen this I told you this is the
[1846.1s] most easiest topic to handle than even
[1848.5s] health.
[1850.1s] See health you need to study a lot of
[1851.6s] anatomy and physiology and look at bones
[1853.9s] and I don't know fibul I don't know
[1857.0s] synovial fluid no this is direct from
[1860.6s] the
[1861.3s] scriptures very easy to understand the
[1864.6s] book of
[1865.6s] Matthew chapter
[1869.0s] 25 are in Matthew chapter
[1871.7s] 25 then let's turn to verse 31 the bible
[1875.7s] says when the son of man shall come in
[1878.3s] his glory and all the holy angels with
[1881.2s] him. Then he shall sit upon the throne
[1883.8s] of his what? Of his glory. And before
[1887.7s] him shall be gathered all nations, and
[1889.5s] he shall separate them one from another
[1892.3s] as shepher divideth his sheep from the
[1895.2s] goats. Ask yourself, where do you want
[1897.2s] to belong? Sheep or
[1899.2s] goat? Sheep or
[1901.2s] goat? Sheep or goat? Sheep. Amen. Who is
[1905.2s] the lamb of God? Christ himself. Verse
[1907.4s] 33 says, "And he shall take the sheep on
[1910.0s] the right hand on the right hand." So
[1913.3s] those who are going to be glorious and
[1915.8s] who are going to overcome sin will be
[1917.6s] upon the right hand of
[1919.2s] who? Of God. When Christ had overcome,
[1922.5s] where was he? Sitting at the right hand
[1925.4s] side of God. Verse 33 says, "And he
[1928.0s] shall set the sheep on his right hand,
[1930.1s] but the goat on the what? The left. Then
[1934.1s] shall the king say unto them on his
[1936.2s] right hand, come ye blessed of my
[1938.1s] father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
[1940.9s] you from the foundation of what? The
[1943.3s] world, for I was hungered and he gave me
[1946.3s] meat. I was thirsty and he gave me
[1948.6s] drink. I was a stranger and you took me
[1951.4s] in. Listen, Christ is saying that you
[1954.8s] who are sitting on my right hand come
[1956.6s] this kingdom belongs to you from the
[1958.0s] foundation of the earth. Now he says
[1960.2s] that when I cry was done what? Was
[1963.1s] hungry and he gave me meat. When I was
[1965.4s] thirsty and he gave me drink. I was a
[1968.2s] stranger and he took me in. Naked and he
[1970.8s] clothed me. I was sick and he visited
[1973.1s] me. I was in prison and he came unto me.
[1976.4s] What Christ? What are you saying? You
[1979.2s] are in
[1981.1s] prison. Or do you think the saints will
[1983.2s] not be like what? Where were you in
[1985.8s] prison? In verse 37 he says then shall
[1989.8s] the righteous answer him saying Lord
[1992.6s] when so we thee and hungered what
[1996.0s] Christ you were hungered somewhere one
[1998.6s] day I never saw
[2000.0s] you I think when sister will be there
[2002.4s] we'll be asking such a question what
[2005.2s] what are you saying Christ I thought you
[2007.3s] are bleeding for us in heaven and now
[2008.9s] you say you are and I've never seen
[2013.5s] anywhere and they will then they will
[2015.8s] say
[2016.9s] Then shall the Russian answer saying,
[2019.1s] Lord, when so we thee and hungered and
[2021.7s] fed thee all thirst and gave thee
[2024.8s] drink, when so we arrange and took thee
[2027.9s] in all naked and clothe thee, or when so
[2031.0s] the sick or in prison, and came unto
[2033.1s] thee, and the king shall answer and say
[2035.4s] unto them, verily, verily I say unto
[2037.0s] you, in as much as ye have done unto one
[2040.3s] of the least of these, my brethren, you
[2042.3s] have done it unto me.
[2045.7s] How is Christ walking?
[2050.9s] How is Christ
[2054.0s] walking? How is Christ
[2058.0s] walking? That if you have just done a
[2061.8s] charity work to someone who was in need,
[2065.7s] then that thing you did to who was
[2068.6s] Christ at that time
[2070.3s] walking? Yes.
[2073.4s] in the person of that person that you
[2075.1s] had to
[2078.1s] help. Turn to the book of Acts. I want
[2080.5s] you to understand. Turn to the book of
[2081.9s] Acts chapter
[2084.5s] 9. The book of Acts chapter
[2091.0s] 9. Are you in the book of Acts chapter
[2094.3s] 9? If you are there, say amen.
[2097.6s] The book of Acts chapter
[2099.6s] 9 verse number three says this is
[2102.9s] Saul and as he journeyied he came near
[2106.4s] Damascus and and suddenly there shine
[2109.4s] round about him a light from
[2111.3s] heaven and he fell on the earth and had
[2113.9s] a voice saying unto him soul soul why
[2116.1s] persecutest thou me? Who is speaking to
[2120.6s] Saul? Then Christ says, "Saul, Saul,
[2124.1s] why was Saul chasing Christ with pangas
[2127.3s] and
[2129.4s] swords?" Who was soul
[2133.9s] persecuting? Was Christ at that time
[2136.2s] walking on the grounds of
[2138.5s] earth? Was he
[2140.8s] walking?
[2143.8s] How? Through human agencies. Thank you,
[2146.2s] brother. You have used a nice English.
[2149.3s] through the human agency he was
[2154.7s] walking. Now he says, "Saul, Saul, why
[2157.6s] persecutest thou? Me?" Now listen verse
[2160.6s] five. And he said, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[2163.2s] And the Lord said, "I am Jesus whom thou
[2167.2s] persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick
[2169.8s] against the pricks." Now Jesus tells
[2171.4s] him, "No, it is me who thou
[2173.9s] perse Christ." What we read this in the
[2176.7s] night when the teacher of prophets was
[2178.5s] presenting that Christ was persecuted in
[2181.7s] the person of what? His saints, his
[2186.1s] people. Was Christ
[2188.5s] walking? Yes. But now Christ was not
[2191.4s] walking literally from
[2193.7s] heaven. But those who are imbued by the
[2196.5s] spirit of Christ when we when they
[2198.5s] persecuted and those who persecute them
[2200.5s] are persecuting Christ himself.
[2203.7s] Because when we receive the spirit of
[2205.5s] Christ, it is now Christ dwelling in
[2208.8s] us. Now Paul says that it is not I that
[2212.2s] live but who liveth in
[2217.6s] me. Amen. Yeah. Paul says that it is not
[2221.6s] me that now live. But now that life that
[2224.2s] is in me is the life of who? Christ. Now
[2227.1s] when he persecuted that person is not
[2229.5s] persecuting because of me I no longer
[2231.2s] lives but now Christ lives in me and
[2233.3s] when he persecutes me he persecute the
[2235.2s] owner of
[2236.0s] the is Christ
[2239.8s] himself. Now says that that word is
[2243.8s] still true because Christ still walks
[2246.6s] and
[2247.7s] seen. He can walk and sin through the
[2250.4s] person of his saints. He can walk and
[2253.0s] sin through his ministers.
[2255.8s] Now when a minister comes to your home
[2257.5s] to visit you and then you chase that
[2259.4s] minister away, whom are you chasing
[2262.2s] away? Whom are you chasing away? And
[2265.0s] then one day Christ was telling you that
[2266.4s] you know one day I came to your home and
[2268.2s] you just chased me away or what Christ
[2270.3s] did you come to my home I never saw
[2272.7s] you. No Christ is with us still in the
[2278.5s] person of his people.
[2281.9s] When I'm speaking here, I'm not speaking
[2283.8s] I myself, but I'm speaking I'm
[2285.8s] representing Christ
[2290.0s] himself. Listen this. We read last time
[2292.5s] when trials overshadow the soul.
[2293.8s] Remember the words of Christ. Remember
[2296.0s] that his unseen presence in the person
[2299.0s] of
[2299.8s] what? In the person of
[2302.3s] what? The Holy
[2305.0s] Spirit. 16 paragraph 2 is some quotation
[2307.8s] that last time. While Jesus minister in
[2310.1s] the heavenly above, he is still by his
[2312.2s] spirit the minister of church on what?
[2314.6s] On earth. How is Christ with
[2316.2s] us? Through his spirit. Listen to 70
[2319.2s] page 273 paragraph 1. As the divine
[2322.1s] endorment, the power of the Holy Spirit
[2324.6s] was given to the disciples. So it will
[2326.8s] today be given to all who seek a right.
[2329.4s] This power alone is able to make us wise
[2331.4s] unto salvation and to fit us for the
[2333.8s] courts above. Christ want us to Christ
[2336.8s] want to give us a blessing that will
[2338.7s] make us holy. These things have I spoken
[2341.0s] unto you says that my joy might remain
[2343.3s] in you and that your joy might be full.
[2346.6s] Joy in the Holy Spirit is healing.
[2350.3s] Giving lifegiving joy. In giving us his
[2354.0s] spirit, God gives us what is God giving
[2357.7s] us another
[2359.2s] God. But in giving us his spirit, God
[2362.4s] gives us what? himself. Now when we
[2365.7s] receive the spirit of God, we receive
[2367.8s] God himself. But now in the person of
[2371.0s] what? His spirit making himself a
[2374.2s] fountain of divine influence to give
[2375.8s] health and life to the world. Turn to
[2378.2s] the book of John chapter
[2380.8s] 14. I'm coming to the book of Acts. Then
[2383.3s] I finish up my study. My time is also
[2385.7s] coming to coming to an end. The book of
[2388.0s] which
[2389.0s] book?
[2391.1s] John chapter 14.
[2394.6s] Are you in chapter 14 of
[2397.4s] John? Yeah. Verse 23. The Bible says,
[2402.6s] "Jesus answered and said unto them, if a
[2404.9s] man love me, he will keep what? My
[2407.5s] words. And my father will love him and
[2409.9s] we will come unto him and make our body
[2412.1s] with him." How is that possible? Will
[2414.3s] God the Father come and be in our
[2416.7s] stomachs? Then Christ also come and say
[2419.0s] in our
[2420.8s] stomachs. How are they with
[2424.1s] us? By the
[2426.5s] spirit. Even when it says by God giving
[2429.2s] us his spirit, God gives us what?
[2432.0s] Himself. That's the end of my study. Say
[2435.2s] amen. No. Turn to your Bible. That is
[2437.6s] not the end of my
[2438.8s] study. Turn to your Bible.
[2442.9s] in the book
[2446.3s] of
[2449.4s] okay the book of acts chapter
[2452.3s] 5 the last
[2454.6s] verse I think we'll
[2457.3s] continue the book of acts chapter
[2460.4s] 5 I wanted you to realize the connection
[2463.7s] between the holy
[2465.8s] spirit and
[2467.7s] angels amen so that you understand when
[2471.1s] I say that the Holy Spirit is much a
[2473.9s] person as God is a person is walking
[2475.5s] this grounds. Then another place he says
[2478.4s] that angels of God are moving up and
[2481.2s] down in our streets. Then what did she
[2484.3s] mean? We need to understand how does God
[2487.1s] brings blessings to us is something that
[2489.9s] we need to understand because there are
[2491.6s] some ministries who teach something that
[2493.3s] is very
[2494.5s] weird. You see our prayers goes to God
[2497.8s] through osmosis. You know what is
[2499.3s] osmosis? When you pray your prayers just
[2501.7s] go to God through
[2503.4s] osmosis. They just
[2507.7s] go. You know what is osmosis? Those who
[2510.7s] those who are privileged to reach from
[2512.3s] two from
[2514.9s] one it just moves slowly from where it
[2518.2s] is concentrated slowly. That is what
[2521.0s] people
[2523.7s] teach. Now listen to the book of acts
[2526.2s] 5:20.
[2528.0s] Then I finish
[2531.6s] up 5:20 says, let's begin from verse 19.
[2535.4s] But the angel of the Lord by night
[2537.0s] opened the prison doors and brought them
[2540.0s] forth and said, who
[2542.7s] say? Who spake? The angel. He said what?
[2547.9s] Go stand and speak in the temple to the
[2550.8s] people or the words of what? Who is
[2554.1s] speaking there? Do you want to do you
[2556.9s] want to know what says about this
[2560.5s] verse? 1888
[2565.6s] materials. Open 1888 materials. My last
[2570.2s] quotation
[2572.9s] 1547 paragraph 2. Now who is speaking
[2576.4s] here? But the angel of the Lord by night
[2579.0s] opened the prison doors and brought them
[2581.0s] forth and said, "Go stand and speak to
[2584.5s] the temple to the people all the words
[2587.8s] of this world. Who has just commanded
[2590.6s] these people to
[2591.9s] speak?" The angels turn to 1888
[2595.5s] materials.
[2597.4s] I've said which
[2601.6s] paid 1547
[2604.7s] sorry paragraph number two listen
[2608.3s] brother sister she says but let us
[2611.4s] follow the history of the men whom the
[2614.1s] Jewish priests and rulers thought so
[2616.0s] dangerous because they were bringing in
[2618.4s] new and strange teaching on almost every
[2620.6s] theological subject that is the same as
[2622.7s] us today. You stand and teach people and
[2625.0s] people think that what what are you
[2626.8s] teaching that is not
[2629.8s] Adventism? See it
[2632.6s] says the command given by the Holy
[2635.7s] Spirit. What listen who gave the command
[2639.0s] in the
[2640.3s] Bible? But now in reports and tell us
[2644.0s] and she's not speaking her words but
[2646.6s] she's speaking what she's given by who?
[2650.6s] By God. She says the command given by
[2654.0s] the Holy Spirit, go stand and speak in
[2656.2s] the temple to the people. All the words
[2658.1s] of this life was obeyed by the apostles.
[2660.7s] Who gave the
[2661.9s] command? It is the Holy Spirit or the
[2664.7s] angel.
[2670.6s] Who gave the
[2673.4s] command? Who gave the command? Says the
[2676.2s] command was given by the Holy Spirit.
[2677.5s] The Bible says an angel. Now, how is
[2680.0s] that possible?
[2687.0s] How does the Holy Spirit speaks? I want
[2689.7s] to stop from there. How does the Holy
[2692.2s] Spirit walks and see? How does it speaks
[2695.2s] yet? It doesn't have a mouth and legs
[2697.0s] and hands. But the Bible says Egypt says
[2700.9s] and the Holy Ghost gave the command. We
[2704.6s] will still be looking at quotations in
[2706.3s] Egypt. There was a prophet in the book
[2709.0s] of verse called Agabas and the Bible has
[2713.1s] used him many times to explain how the
[2715.5s] holy spirit said but now may God help us
[2718.4s] understand as tomorrow we shall continue
[2720.9s] from there so we understand the office
[2724.1s] work of the holy spirit they are
[2725.6s] delegates who works in that office amen
[2729.4s] then don't believe some strange
[2731.0s] doctrines that our prayers goes to god
[2733.0s] through
[2734.0s] osmosis I don't know which ministry is
[2736.1s] that teaching that I've s ministries you
[2738.6s] know you just pray and your prayers come
[2741.4s] from the father through osmosis and then
[2743.0s] they are answered hey what's that
[2745.2s] man we shall look the ministration of
[2747.7s] all angels how do our prayers goes to
[2750.6s] the father you have to go back to
[2752.1s] Jacob's
[2753.3s] what Jacob's what learn and understand
[2757.2s] may God bless us all in Jesus
[2762.1s] name let's
[2776.0s] pray. We thank your precious father in
[2778.6s] heaven for this wonderful
[2781.1s] morning. We have opened thy word. You
[2783.5s] have led
[2784.4s] us. I myself am a weak
[2787.5s] vessel, not worthy to stand before thy
[2790.0s] people to present thy word. that because
[2791.5s] of thy mercies upon my
[2793.4s] life, you still grant me chances to
[2797.1s] teach thy word. How I pray that you help
[2800.2s] all of us God that
[2801.9s] indeed we need to know they are right
[2805.3s] and we need to be
[2807.8s] sanctified. We really facing much
[2810.0s] troubles as youths but this year you
[2812.9s] have called us to make a decision by our
[2815.0s] own self to serve thee.
[2817.8s] Help us to decide to serve thee as the
[2820.6s] only true
[2821.7s] God. Help us to decide that at the end
[2824.3s] of this convention,
[2825.9s] Father, we might go back and study our
[2828.5s] Bibles and understand who you are.
[2830.9s] Right? Give us the spirit of loving thy
[2834.0s] word. Give us the spirit of loving to
[2837.5s] study that father we may be build upon
[2840.1s] the platform of eternal truth. Thank you
[2842.7s] for the women who are kneeling down
[2844.0s] here, the men, the old men, the young
[2845.7s] men, the children. Give us strength,
[2849.2s] Father, that in these days of atonement,
[2851.3s] we might look upon our lives that where
[2854.6s] we are still not worthy, we may be
[2856.7s] afflicted and come to true
[2859.3s] repentance that Father, we may live a
[2861.5s] holy life. May you plant a spirit of
[2864.3s] hating sin in our life that we hate sin
[2866.5s] and don't love only righteousness.
[2868.9s] The duties of this day we commit upon
[2870.7s] your hand. Help us in everything. We
[2873.5s] know your presence is here and you are
[2875.5s] walking here with us. And each and every
[2878.3s] word we
[2879.5s] utter, each and every thought we we
[2883.1s] think of that is not worthy of thee,
[2884.9s] Father, we know you are noting them down
[2886.6s] through the ministration of the he
[2888.9s] angels. Help us to check our paths while
[2891.6s] thy spirit is leading us to only do the
[2894.7s] things which are right before thee.
[2897.1s] We pray that they will prevail as we are
[2899.4s] making decisions. Father, as
[2901.3s] youths, help us not to make decisions
[2903.8s] out of excitement of these
[2906.0s] truths. But help us to be convicted of
[2908.6s] the truth in the
[2910.4s] Bible. That as we come out of this
[2912.6s] convention, you may say that indeed this
[2914.4s] is the truth from the Bible. Because you
[2916.9s] know, after this, we are going to face
[2918.6s] persecutions. We are going to be
[2920.4s] separated from our friends. Those who
[2923.0s] are clinging upon are going to leave us
[2925.4s] and run away from us. But you know that
[2928.3s] when you are convicted of thy truth, we
[2930.5s] know that you are going to be with us.
[2932.7s] Guide each and every youth who is
[2934.2s] listening unto thy voice, the children.
[2936.9s] Father, help us. Provide for us ways. We
[2940.2s] know you promise us in the Bible that
[2941.8s] when we believe thy truth and when we
[2944.5s] are convicted of thy truth and decide to
[2946.3s] walk in the truth, you are going to
[2947.6s] provide ways for us to live in this
[2949.3s] earth. Let all prevail as we claim upon
[2952.3s] daily unto thy promises is our prayer by
[2955.1s] faith in Jesus holy name. Amen.
