FULL TRANSCRIPT:
My name is Matis. I'm from Germany. Um I'm with a very small ministry. We are called Salt of the Earth. I'm the only Bible worker we have. So you are far advanced with the young evangelist and I'm learning so much here. So thank you. And thank you also for the privilege to share with you. We didn't expect to have that privilege. That's why we came with this casual appearance. So please forgive us about that. Um I want to start with a question. Um who of you wants to be a teacher? Can I have a show of hands? Is there somebody who wants to be a teacher here? Okay. You see I I want to be a teacher. So that counts as well. Can somebody read for for us Hebrews 5:12? painful, for when for the time he ought to be teachers, ye have been that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracle of God and have become such a sub need of milk and not of strong meat. Thank you. So let me ask you again. Who of you wants to be a teacher? Okay, we learn from this verse that Paul wants us to be teacher, right? That's the progression. We we come to learn of the Lord and the Lord gives us gifts and we we get trained and after a while we should be able to teach others to train others and that's how um the church of God multiplies because everybody becomes a teacher and teaches others. So I think that's the vision of Christ. I think that's also the vision of the young evangelists, right? You want to get trained to train others. Um that's the biblical principle. So basically the Bible wants us to be teachers and Paul even rebukes them because they weren't teachers at that time and they shouldn't. Right? So the condition of a teacher should be position that should be acquired by anybody who's part of the church of Christ according to Paul. After a while everybody should be a teacher. So let's read James 3 verse one 3:1 James 3:1 my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. Thank you. My German Bible translates be not many teachers. Be not many teachers. It says in my German Bible. So that's interesting, right? Because Paul says you should be teach us by now. James has a, you know, can you teach us at least according to my wife. So what's right now? Either we get rebuked by uh Paul or by James. No, that's that's not a contradiction right here. But there are two ways of being a teacher and these are inherently different to each other. two ways of being a teacher. Let me tell you which two ways exist there. So there is the way of being a teacher which is all about service. And there's the way of being a teacher which is all about status. There's the way of being a teacher which is all about responsibility. And there's the way of being a teacher which is all about personal gain. There's the way being a teacher which is all about having joy about bringing others to the position of authority and there's the way of being a teacher of having joy in being in a position of authority yourself and those are completely different types being a teacher and since I learned that the young evangelists they are all about training and we want to become teachers and teach others Let us now look at one person in the Bible who was a teacher. But unfortunately at that point of time he wasn't the second character. He was on status. He was all about having authority himself and not bringing others to that position. He was not about responsibility but more about personal gain. Um and we read of that person in J uh John Gospel of John chapter 3. John chapter 3 and please read verse one. Bible read verse one. There was man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus of the Jews. Yes. Thank you. So what what do we learn here about this man Nicodemus? He was a what? Pharisees. Thank you. And what else do we learn of him? He was a ruler of Jesus. Thank you. So he was a Pharisee. He was a learned man. Pharisees. Pharisees usually knew many large parts of the scriptures by heart. He was very knowledgeable. He was also one of the leaders of the Jews probably part of the St. Israel. That is what we also learned from Ellen White. So he was not only a teacher, he was up there up there in the society of the Jews. And what we what we learn also from from the writings of Ellen White is that he had pride about that. He loved being a teacher. He loved having this status of being a teacher. And so it it came to pass that he met Christ. But this meeting back then this meeting it didn't turn out the way it should. Let us look at the another person uh just John chapter 4 and please uh re read for us um verse 7 verse seven there come the woman who married to draw water Jesus said unto her give me to drink what's the name of that woman Samaritan woman yes we know where she comes from but we We all know her name here with Nikas. It was different. We know his name. He was up there. Everybody knew his name. This is just one woman coming to the well. It's not only it's not any woman. She's a Samaritan. She's not even a Jew. She's there. She's not a man. She's a woman. She's a Samaritan. And further we learn that she had many men. So where is she in society? Down there. Right. So Nicodemus is up here and she is down there. When when did Nicodemus approach Jesus? Right. We we looking from from John 3 verse 2, the first part of the verse. Can you read it to us please? Says the same came to Jesus by night. Yes, Nicodemus came by night and it is in the spirit of prophecy that we learn it was around midnight when it is darkest. You know there's much symbolism in that. Can can we read also John 13:E8 please? But in verse 8, Peter said unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wish thee not, thou was not bad with me." Thank you, brother. Um um give me a second. That was the wrong verse. It's verse 30, right? Thank you, brother. It says he then having received the soul went immediately out and it was night. That was it. So this is about Judas and I find it interesting that John adds it was the night when Judas betrayed Jesus. So there's much symbolism in this. night is like there's no light and that was what the the the time when Nicodemus approached Jesus and the the interesting thing is in John 19 verse 39 maybe you can read it again for us brother 1939 the Bible reads and there came also Nicodemus which at the first came to Jesus by night and brought a mixture of Myra and others about 100 pound weight. So from this verse we learn that Nicodemus he changed. He changed and we praise God for that. But John adds here back then he came by night. Back then he was in darkness. So this is what he what what is the symbolism be behind Nicodemus approaching Jesus by night? Why did he come by night? Do you know? Do have you read in in the writings of Ellen White? Why did he come by night? It was his bride. He he didn't want to be seen with Jesus. So that's why he came to him by night. He didn't want to be associated with it was this pride of being a teacher and he didn't want to Yeah. He he had a wrong understanding of of his position as a teacher. Let's go back to the woman at the well. When when did she approach Jesus? John verse 4, I think. I don't know which verse it is, but let's just check it. It's verse six. Can you read it to us? Verse six. It reads, "Now Jacob said was there. Jesus therefore being weary with his giant sapph." Do you know what time it is in our time? 6th hour. Midday. Thank you. And when the sun is at the highest point, that's the biggest light. So dear brethren, there's there's a lot to learn from this. And what what I want to take away from this and I I also I want to be a teacher. I want to be a good teacher. But let's not be a teacher like Nicol Demos was back then. Somebody who thinks of himself highly who who wants to be in a position of authority. You know, authority is nothing we should look look for because if anything, responsibility is a burden. And well, it is necessary that some men have responsibility. But the true followers of Christ, they know the burden that it brings with with itself and and they feel that responsibility. And we know this also from from Moses and many many men they knew that after a while when they were young they didn't know that Moses did not know that but after a while he understood oh authority that that is a heavy heavy burden and it's not something I should try to get it's not a position that is so nice for me so good in a way and if if you think that's a position you want think again. So because responsibility and and authority comes together and there's so much pain connected with this. We we see this especially with Jesus. So I I don't say that we should fear responsibility because if God gives us responsibility, we are ready for it. But we ourselves, we should always try to well to to not to think too highly of ourselves, right? So yeah, that's that's the thought I I wanted to to give you on on your way as as missionaries. Let's let's let's be humble. Let's stay humble. And if God may may raise us to a position of authority, it should be his will. But we from ourselves we we are it's good for us to just think of ourselves and just use that authority that we have right now and not look to to get too much of it. Yes. So um let us pray and of course it will kneel with me. Our dear father in heaven, your church needs responsible men and men who are able for the office of authority. And I pray that many men of this kind will arise from this group. So that's why I pray before anything else for the spirit of humility, for humbleness, for honesty. Dear father, please give this spirit to this precious group of young people and please lead them that there may be many men will arise that um many many teachers will come to the position of authority but by your will dear father not by one's own will that we pray in the precious name of Jesus. Amen.

TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[0.1s] My name is Matis. I'm from Germany. Um
[3.9s] I'm with a very small ministry. We are
[6.4s] called Salt of the Earth. I'm the only
[8.9s] Bible worker we have. So you are far
[12.1s] advanced with the young evangelist and
[14.0s] I'm learning so much here. So thank you.
[17.1s] And thank you also for the privilege to
[19.0s] share with you. We didn't expect to have
[21.9s] that privilege. That's why we came with
[24.8s] this casual appearance. So please
[26.7s] forgive us about that.
[30.8s] Um I want to start with a question. Um
[33.8s] who of you wants to be a teacher? Can I
[35.8s] have a show of hands? Is there somebody
[37.8s] who wants to be a
[39.3s] teacher
[40.9s] here? Okay. You see I I want to be a
[44.3s] teacher. So that counts as well. Can
[46.4s] somebody read for for us Hebrews 5:12?
[65.1s] painful, for when for the time he ought
[67.5s] to be teachers, ye have been that one
[70.2s] teach you again which be the first
[72.2s] principles of the oracle of God and have
[75.0s] become such a sub need of milk and not
[77.4s] of strong meat.
[80.0s] Thank you. So let me ask you again. Who
[82.8s] of you wants to be a
[87.5s] teacher? Okay, we learn from this verse
[90.5s] that Paul wants us to be teacher,
[94.1s] right? That's the progression. We we
[97.4s] come to learn of the Lord and the Lord
[99.3s] gives us gifts and we we get trained and
[102.6s] after a while we should be able to teach
[104.9s] others to train others and that's how um
[108.8s] the church of God multiplies because
[111.4s] everybody becomes a teacher and teaches
[113.2s] others. So I think that's the vision of
[116.4s] Christ. I think that's also the vision
[118.6s] of the young evangelists, right? You
[121.5s] want to get trained to train others. Um
[125.3s] that's the biblical principle. So
[128.0s] basically the Bible wants us to be
[130.4s] teachers and Paul even rebukes them
[134.0s] because they weren't teachers at that
[135.9s] time and they
[137.1s] shouldn't.
[138.8s] Right? So the condition of a teacher
[142.2s] should be position that should be
[145.0s] acquired by anybody who's part of the
[148.1s] church of Christ according to Paul.
[151.1s] After a while everybody should be a
[153.3s] teacher.
[155.8s] So let's read James 3 verse one
[162.9s] 3:1 James
[165.3s] 3:1 my brethren be not many masters
[169.6s] knowing that we shall receive the
[171.1s] greater condemnation.
[173.3s] Thank you. My German Bible translates be
[177.4s] not many
[179.2s] teachers. Be not many teachers. It says
[182.2s] in my German
[183.5s] Bible. So that's interesting, right?
[186.6s] Because Paul says you should be teach us
[188.8s] by now. James has a, you know, can you
[191.8s] teach us at least according to my
[194.7s] wife. So what's right now? Either we get
[198.1s] rebuked by uh Paul or by
[201.6s] James. No, that's that's not a
[203.9s] contradiction right here. But there are
[205.8s] two ways of being a teacher and these
[208.7s] are inherently different to each other.
[211.4s] two ways of being a
[213.3s] teacher. Let me tell you which two ways
[217.0s] exist there. So there is the way of
[221.1s] being a teacher which is all about
[224.4s] service. And there's the way of being a
[226.6s] teacher which is all about status.
[230.1s] There's the way of being a teacher which
[232.5s] is all about
[235.1s] responsibility. And there's the way of
[237.1s] being a teacher which is all about
[239.0s] personal gain.
[241.0s] There's the way being a teacher which is
[244.2s] all about having joy about bringing
[246.9s] others to the position of authority and
[249.9s] there's the way of being a teacher of
[252.2s] having joy in being in a position of
[255.3s] authority
[257.0s] yourself and those are completely
[259.8s] different types being a teacher and
[262.9s] since I learned that the young
[265.2s] evangelists they are all about training
[267.4s] and we want to become teachers and teach
[269.6s] others
[271.0s] Let us now look at one person in the
[274.8s] Bible who was a teacher. But
[277.3s] unfortunately at that point of time he
[280.4s] wasn't the second
[282.0s] character. He was on status. He was all
[286.6s] about having authority himself and not
[289.4s] bringing others to that position. He was
[292.5s] not about responsibility but more about
[295.2s] personal gain.
[298.0s] Um and we read of that person in J uh
[302.6s] John Gospel of John chapter 3.
[309.6s] John chapter 3 and please read verse
[312.6s] one. Bible read verse
[314.8s] one. There was man of the Pharisees
[317.9s] named
[318.8s] Nicodemus of the Jews.
[322.5s] Yes. Thank you.
[325.4s] So what what do we learn here about this
[328.4s] man
[330.7s] Nicodemus? He was a what? Pharisees.
[334.2s] Thank you. And what else do we learn of
[336.4s] him? He was a ruler of Jesus. Thank you.
[341.6s] So he was a Pharisee. He was a learned
[343.8s] man. Pharisees. Pharisees usually knew
[347.0s] many large parts of the scriptures by
[349.7s] heart. He was very knowledgeable.
[354.8s] He was also one of the leaders of the
[357.9s] Jews probably part of the St.
[360.9s] Israel. That is what we also learned
[363.4s] from Ellen White. So he was not only a
[367.1s] teacher, he was up
[370.0s] there up there in the society of the
[373.5s] Jews. And what we what we learn also
[376.6s] from from the writings of Ellen White is
[378.6s] that he had pride about that.
[381.5s] He loved being a teacher. He loved
[384.9s] having this status of being a teacher.
[388.4s] And so it it came to pass that he met
[391.9s] Christ. But this
[393.9s] meeting back then this meeting it didn't
[397.7s] turn out the way it should.
[401.4s] Let us look at the another person uh
[404.7s] just John chapter
[407.2s] 4 and please uh re read for us um verse
[412.6s] 7 verse seven there come the woman who
[416.5s] married to draw water Jesus said unto
[419.1s] her give me to drink
[423.8s] what's the name of that woman
[426.9s] Samaritan woman yes we know where she
[429.4s] comes from but we We all know her name
[432.1s] here with Nikas. It was different. We
[435.4s] know his name. He was up there.
[437.9s] Everybody knew his name. This is just
[441.4s] one woman coming to the
[444.6s] well. It's not only it's not any woman.
[448.0s] She's a
[449.1s] Samaritan. She's not even a Jew. She's
[451.8s] there. She's not a man. She's a
[454.7s] woman. She's a Samaritan.
[457.6s] And further we learn that she had many
[461.1s] men. So where is she in society? Down
[464.7s] there. Right. So Nicodemus is up here
[468.2s] and she is down
[470.9s] there. When when did Nicodemus approach
[475.0s] Jesus? Right. We we looking from from
[478.4s] John 3 verse 2, the first part of the
[481.7s] verse. Can you read it to us please?
[483.2s] Says the same came to Jesus by night.
[487.2s] Yes, Nicodemus came by night and it is
[491.3s] in the spirit of prophecy that we learn
[493.0s] it was around midnight when it is
[499.2s] darkest. You know there's much symbolism
[501.9s] in that. Can can we read also John 13:E8
[506.0s] please?
[507.8s] But in verse
[511.7s] 8, Peter said unto him, "Thou shalt
[515.2s] never wash my feet." Jesus answered him,
[518.2s] "If I wish thee not, thou was not bad
[521.1s] with
[522.8s] me." Thank you, brother. Um
[529.1s] um give me a second. That was the wrong
[531.0s] verse.
[533.6s] It's verse 30, right? Thank you,
[536.5s] brother. It says he then having received
[539.5s] the soul went immediately out and it was
[542.6s] night.
[544.2s] That was it. So this is about Judas and
[548.5s] I find it
[550.0s] interesting that John adds it was the
[553.4s] night when Judas betrayed Jesus. So
[556.6s] there's much symbolism in this. night is
[559.7s] like there's no light and that was what
[564.4s] the the the time when Nicodemus
[568.0s] approached Jesus and the the interesting
[571.8s] thing is in John 19 verse 39 maybe you
[576.3s] can read it again for us brother
[580.8s] 1939 the Bible reads and there came also
[584.6s] Nicodemus which at the first came to
[586.6s] Jesus by night and brought a mixture of
[589.0s] Myra and others about 100 pound weight.
[594.2s] So from this verse we learn that
[596.7s] Nicodemus he changed. He changed and we
[599.3s] praise God for that. But John adds here
[603.6s] back then he came by
[606.0s] night. Back then he was in darkness.
[611.3s] So this is what he what what is the
[615.0s] symbolism be behind Nicodemus
[617.8s] approaching Jesus by night? Why did he
[620.0s] come by night? Do you know?
[625.1s] Do have you read in in the writings of
[627.0s] Ellen White? Why did he come by
[630.0s] night? It was his bride. He he didn't
[633.4s] want to be seen with
[635.4s] Jesus. So that's why he came to him by
[639.2s] night. He didn't want to be associated
[643.1s] with it was this pride of being a
[645.8s] teacher and he didn't want to Yeah. He
[649.1s] he had a wrong understanding of of his
[651.2s] position as a
[652.8s] teacher. Let's go back to the woman at
[655.2s] the well. When when did she approach
[657.5s] Jesus? John verse 4, I think. I don't
[661.0s] know which verse it is, but let's just
[663.6s] check it.
[671.4s] It's verse six. Can you read it to us?
[673.5s] Verse six. It reads, "Now Jacob said was
[677.1s] there. Jesus therefore being weary with
[679.9s] his giant sapph."
[684.2s] Do you know what time it is in our time?
[686.3s] 6th hour. Midday. Thank you. And when
[690.4s] the sun is at the highest
[693.0s] point, that's the biggest light.
[697.1s] So dear brethren, there's there's a lot
[699.4s] to learn from this. And what what I want
[701.7s] to take away from this and I I also I
[705.4s] want to be a teacher. I want to be a
[706.7s] good teacher. But let's not be a teacher
[709.5s] like Nicol Demos was back then. Somebody
[712.9s] who thinks of himself highly who who
[716.3s] wants to be in a position of authority.
[718.8s] You know, authority is nothing we should
[721.6s] look look for because if anything,
[725.7s] responsibility is a burden. And well, it
[729.4s] is necessary that some men have
[732.7s] responsibility. But the true followers
[737.0s] of Christ, they know the burden that it
[740.0s] brings with with itself and and they
[743.1s] feel that responsibility. And we know
[745.0s] this also from from Moses and many many
[747.5s] men they knew that after a while when
[751.8s] they were young they didn't know that
[753.8s] Moses did not know that but after a
[756.9s] while he understood oh authority that
[759.7s] that is a heavy heavy burden and it's
[763.1s] not something I should try to get it's
[766.6s] not a position that is so nice for me so
[769.6s] good in a way and if if you think that's
[773.2s] a position you
[775.1s] want think
[776.9s] again. So because responsibility and and
[782.4s] authority comes together and there's so
[785.8s] much pain connected with this. We we see
[789.0s] this especially with Jesus. So I I don't
[792.4s] say that we should fear responsibility
[794.6s] because if God gives us responsibility,
[797.4s] we are ready for it. But we ourselves,
[800.8s] we should always try
[804.0s] to well to to not to think too highly of
[807.9s] ourselves, right? So yeah, that's that's
[811.7s] the thought I I wanted to to give you on
[814.6s] on your way as as missionaries. Let's
[817.8s] let's let's be humble. Let's stay
[819.7s] humble. And if God may may raise us to a
[823.1s] position of authority, it should be his
[825.5s] will. But we from ourselves we we are
[830.3s] it's good for us to just think of
[833.8s] ourselves and just use that authority
[837.0s] that we have right now and not look to
[839.1s] to get too much of it. Yes. So um let us
[845.4s] pray and of course it will kneel with
[861.1s] me.
[862.9s] Our dear father in
[865.8s] heaven, your church needs responsible
[869.1s] men and men who are able for the office
[872.8s] of
[873.8s] authority. And I pray that many men of
[877.4s] this kind will arise from this
[879.9s] group. So that's why I pray before
[883.4s] anything else for the spirit of
[886.9s] humility, for
[888.8s] humbleness, for honesty. Dear father,
[892.6s] please give this spirit to this precious
[895.9s] group of young
[897.4s] people and please lead them that there
[901.0s] may be many men will arise that um many
[906.4s] many teachers will
[908.4s] come to the position of authority but by
[911.8s] your will dear father not by one's own
[914.6s] will that we pray in the precious name
[917.1s] of Jesus. Amen.
