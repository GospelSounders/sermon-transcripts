FULL TRANSCRIPT:
yes welcome back we're going to see just just what is entailed in uh the history of the Jews when God called them other people to represent him and his character in the whole world in order to understand the truth as it is in Jesus let us see just what we are supposed to do we are seeing we are reading from the book The salvages and this is based on religion you must take your Bible and confirm if this is true or false go to history and find out for yourself I'm not putting this for you so that I might grind you up and force it into your thought drink it or to swallow it please check into your history and find out if you are supposed to understand the truths for this time I'm going to read from the book called These are of Ages the foundation of Education in Israel we are going to see if education was necessary in Israel was it a true education or was it absent did we have an education system we're going to see let us read from the sort of page number 69 paragraph two you think from the earliest times the faithful the faithful in Israel had given much care to the education of the youth the faithful had given much care in the education of the youth okay the Lord had directed that even from babyhood the children should be taught of his goodness and his greatness all right the CH the from babyhood the children should be taught of his goodness and his greatness especially as revealed in his law the first education was to teach children from babyhood his law God's law okay and shown in the history of Israel okay I think especially as revealed in his his law and shown in the history of Israel how he used to deal with the Israelite he's saying song and prayer and lesson from the scriptures were to be adapted to the opening mind all right song and prayer to in the heat the history of Israelites this is just what happened they used to teach their children through education based on true education they used to teach their children through education God's goodness based in his law then it is going on these are overages page 69 paragraph two chain all right the Lord who had directed that even from baby who the children should be taught of his goodness and his greatness especially as it revealed in his law and shown in the history of Israel song and prayer and lessons from the scriptures were to be adapted to the opening mind fathers and mothers who are to instruct their children that the law of God is an expression of his character all right the law of God was an expression of his character then he's saying and that as they receive the principles of the law into the heart the image of God was stressed on mind and soul that is the essence as to why Jesus came to die on the cross to restore the image of God in man all right both in the mind and in the soul much of the teaching was oral but the youth also learned to read the Hebrew writing they learn how to read and write in short not it is not essential to read Hebrew in order to understand faith in Jesus it is an emphasis of on writing and reading in order to convey a message so we are told but the youth also learned to read the Hebrew writings and the parchment roles of the Old Testament the scriptures were open to their study paragraph three page 69 deservages in the days of Christ the town or city that did not provide for the religious instruction of the young was regarded as Under The Curse Of God yet the teaching had become formal so in a education just as today people required regard those who did not receive education as low right now we can see it just this similarly with we read it it was in Israel so we are reading it's saying yet the teaching had become formal teaching had become so tradition had in a great degree supplanted the scripture tradition had supplanted the scripture okay so tradition what tradition will always approved through education just watch as false education is spreading in the land the True Church of God is going to spread in the land with tradition of men putting on skirts anyway well just going on we are told tradition had in a great degree Supply in the scriptures true education will lead the youth to seek the Lord what seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him acts 17 verse 27 and quote but the Jewish teachers gave the attention to the matters of ceremony the mind was crowded with material all right so we are told that education was in Israel let us see just what happened that education in Israel during the time of Jesus got corrupt got corrupted uh before we read that I'm going to open with a scripture that says John 7 verse number John 7. verse number uh verse 10 it's saying but when his Brethren were gone up then when he was up and to the fists not openly but as it were in secret then verse 11 then the Jesus sought him at the feast and said where is he and verse 12 and he and there was much murmuring among the Jews concerning him for some said he is a good man others saying no but he deceived the people all right so through education versus false education let's see verse number 14 verse 13 John 7 13 how we eat no man speak openly of him for fear of the Jews all right they feared because he had the true education and the Jews had adopted another education we will see if it is true or false we're going to read just from our resources we're saying verse 14. now about the midst of the Feast of in the Middle East of the feast in the Middle East of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught so people are not taught these things so he went up in the middies of the Fists in the middle when it is climax he went to teach the doctrine of true education he went to teach according to True education that God had directed so this let's go and see what he thought how he thought verse 15 and the Jews Marvel saying how no this man let us having never learned I don't know this man let us having never learned so Jesus never went to the school of the Jews so as we read in the set of Ages page 80 that Jesus the rabbits knew Jesus never attended their schools as now we are going to see just how Jesus taught ah this is the services page 70.1 it is saying the Child Jesus did not receive instruction in the synagogue schools never why we are going to find out a lot much much more he's saying his mother was his first human teacher from her lips and from the Scrolls of the prophet he learned of heavenly things the very Words which he himself had spoken to Moses for Israel was for Israel he was now taught at his mother's knee okay so Jesus is receiving the true education home schooling homeschooling all right so he's saying he was now taught at his mother's knee as he Advanced from childhood to youth he did not seek the schools of the rabbis all right as he Advanced from childhoods to youth he did not seek the schools of the rabies he needed not the education to be obtained from such sources okay for God was his instructor all right now those are that is the spirit of true Reformation Spirit of Tourism our schools are teaching religion from the East and some parents are not aware of this we are parents we are not even checking the books our children are learning baptism infant baptism those are pagan Pagan things that are inherited by the Catholicism called Catholic but that is Pagan Pagan my friend they are learning how to communicate with the Dead how to communicate with Spirits they call it Spirits have you have you checked those books we are going to open those books line upon line I'm going to screen them up and to bring them up in the as facilities are going to be brought in God is going to send servants who are going to serve in different capacity machines are going to be here and we're going to expose all that whatever achieving and learning now we are in in the book The salvages page number 70.1 it ends and says I see advance from childhood to youth he did not seek the school of the rabbis he needed not the education to be obtained from such sausage for God was this instruction the question asked during the same the savior's Ministry how now is this man let us having Never Land does not indicate that Jesus was unable to read but merely that he had not received a rabbinical education they never saw Jesus in their schools because in that time as in the previous video that I just gave out was the kingdom of the Greeks the Greeks had colonized the old Earth and the old Earth had been hellenized it has the Earth had received a Greek education with its tradition and and rights but then we are going to see how Israelites had made an alliance with the Fallen Nation Greek and Roman Empire let's go and see we are going to understand events that transpire in the time of Jesus foreshadowed the time of the 144 we are going to see if these things show just our duties it continues how nice this does not indicate that Jesus was unable to read me but merely that he had received he had not received merely he had not received a rabbinical education John 17 7 verse 15. since he gained knowledge as we may do his intimate intimate acquaintance with the scripture shows how diligently his early years were given to the study of God's word okay okay and spread out before him was The Great Library of God's created works all right he who had made all things started the lessons which is on hand had written in art and sky under sky and and sea and sky apart from the Unholy ways of the world he gathered stones of scientific knowledge from nature he studied the life of plants and animals and the life of man from his earliest year he was possessed of one purpose he lived to bless others for this he found resources in nature for this he found resources in nature new ideas of ways and means flushed into his mind as he studied plant as he studied the plant all right um so it is a study plan for this he found resources in nature new ideas of ways and means flashed into his mind as he studied plant life and animal life continually he was seeking to draw from things sin illustration by which he presents the living Oracles of God how to teach the truth of Heaven he had to learn he had to learn as a human he had to see just what human beings are acquainted to in order to teach them the things of heaven then he said continually he was seeking to draw something seen illustration by which he to present the living Oracles of God linking the Heavenly things with the Earthly Jesus had to take time with that in order to know our weaknesses he had to take all that time all three years of ministration to finalize everything he's God my friend but all of us combined we can't finish studying these art actually recently the scientists started discovering some other organism in under the sea that had been existing so it it is not even in reckon they are already putting it in the record so that finding out new on new things yet Jesus took three years to teach the Oracle of heaven so we are told this okay he studied plant life fast forward The Parables by which during his ministry he loved to teach his lessons of Truth show how open his Spirit was to the influences of Nature and how he had gathered the spiritual teaching from the surrounding of his daily life so we see Jesus have obtaining true education in nature right now as you are watching as you have seen just right around us this is nature we are planning and we are already in the ground breaking the ground in order that the this place may be viable for True education and for you you can see we had already begun a modern toilet this is a building of a modern toilet it is under construction and right in front of you on the other side of me you can see we had a structure a simple structure The Lord Is Us directing us to make simple structure for True education we are told as we make two we make ground for True education the Lord will send help let those who have meetings bring their means in order to glorify God to see just what we have to do in this last day and how we should know that these things are taking place are to take place read the signs of the time and knowing the time Romans chapter 13 11 knowing the time that that day is so closer then we should allow arise from let's not sleep for the sleeping virgins to arise they must know the time in which they are living in so we are just uh seeing the education system that Jesus did not receive and the education system which is true that Jesus received as a young alien boy so let me go fast forward to see just what the education the type of education that Jesus received the same same book these are of Ages we are going to sing the book called Desire of Ages page 86 paragraph two the type of education was it a lower education style was it a middle education or was it a higher education and what is high education let's see uh the surveys page number 86 paragraph two it goes saying his brothers are the sons of Joseph were called sided with the rabbis they insisted that the tradition must be heated as if they were the requirements of God they even regarded the precepts of men more highly than the word of God and they were greatly annoyed at the clear penetration of Jesus in distinguishing between the false and the true all right so true education enables you to distinguish true and false his strict obedience to the law of God they condemned as stubbornness that was a reformer my friend that was a reformer they were surprised at the knowledge and wisdom he showed in answering the rubbish they knew that he had not received instruction from the wise men yet they could not but see that he was an instructor to them okay so he was an instructor why because of the education system which he had learned from his babyhood to his manhood through his youthful uh alive he's saying the chain from the wife yet they could not but see that he was an instructor to them to the rabbis they recognized that his education was of a higher time than their own all right they recognized that his education was of a higher type than their own but they did not decide that he had access to the Tree of Life okay so there is something known as the Tree of Life yesterday as we are doing our series we realized that in the Garden of Eden there was a tree fast the tree of knowledge second the tree of life so we have the tree of false and true and we have the tree of pain that perpetuates life so we are seeing that the book The the that in the garden of Heaven had Eden we see that there was a section of instruction Where Angels often Revisited in order to instruct Adam and Eve then we can understand all the prophetic patterns are exact and all striking at the same level just as we are in order to inherit life we have to avoid the mixed education that is mixed true and false and we have to go straight to the Tree of Life which represented Christ Jesus all right so we are seeing but they did not discern that he had access to the Tree of Life a source of knowledge of which they were ignorant okay so Christ was not exclusive and he had given special offense to the Pharisees by departing in his respect from their rigid rules he found the domain of religion fans in by high walls of seclusion as to Sacred a matter for everyday life these words of petition he overthrew true education will overthrow petition okay was of petition or self-service true education will not serve serve true education will serve others the nation will be rid of bribery rib of corruption even your own child will not bribe you therefore you will have fruits of true education the Treaty of life we love we love its bearing upon a nation like this let us see just what true education did in the life of Jesus we want to see just what it was okay uh we are seeing from the book called The sarovated the Simpson book uh seeing the type uh the education system of Jesus what it did to him and others all right was it self-service of others the Jewish that is deserve Ages page 317 paragraph three it is saying this way it is saying the Jews had been instructed from childhood concerning the work of the Messiah all right so true education she will teach you the work of Jesus the work of Salvation the true service the work in which your soul and mind is to be saved like likewise we are seeing the Jews were taught from childhood concerning the work of the Mississauga they inspired utterances so Patrick and Prophets and the symbolic teaching of the sacrificial service had been theirs they were learning in the symbolic teaching in this in the synagogue I mean or in the temple here we are told in the temple they were learning all these sacrificial service so this object lesson about the Messiah but they had disregarded the light and now they saw in Jesus nothing to be desired but the Centurion burning Hedonism Centurion was born in Hidden can you see that Centurion the Centurion we know that the Sanhedrin was full of leaders who were given for self-service now here at the side of which shows us that the Centurion burning Hedonism educated in the idolatry of Imperial Ron all right so they were indicated by the Roman trained as a soldier seemingly cut off from spiritual life by his education and surroundings and still further shot out by the begoty of the Jews and by the content of his own countrymen for the people of Israel this man perceived the truth to which the children of Abraham were blinded so there was a Roman Centurion this Roman Centurion was he learned from a hidden background his background is based on Hedonism therefore what happened he did not wait to see whether he the Jews themselves will receive the one who claimed to be their Messiah so the question is we want to see that the true what true education imparted in the life of Jesus we are seeing that in his life he had to impact the Tree of Life to others through understanding true education like was even unto us we have to impart the light unto the World by understanding just what true education can do to us and our own children if our children received to education that will be true love cry but if they receive no true education they will fail in the courts when they will they shall be summoned before the loyal before the Great Men of the Earth so this Centurion we are told that the Centurion accessed Jesus he did not care whether they use themselves will receive the one who claimed to be their Messer as the light which lighted every man that coming into the world John 1 9. had shown upon him he had though far off the Sun the glory of the Son of God so Jesus reflected the glory of his father okay to the lost the Centurion was a Roman soldier at a capacity of centurion this is a capacity the title of centurion uh sorry I just blinded it as if it was a sun heading but Centurion was the class of I mean it was a category of soldiers who had their duty to be done and they were called Centurion there were those who were called uh other names but now this is a centurion okay okay so we are told that Jesus Jesus a type of education had been that of imparting the blessings of Heaven so what is higher education what does the spiritual prophecy describe as higher education we at all in the book called this Center of Ages page 464 paragraph four it goes on and says that was the True Light which lighted every man that cometh into the world quote the world had the world has had its great teachers men of giant elect and wonderful research men whose utterances have stimulated thought and open to view fast fields of knowledge and this men have been honored as guides and many factors of their race okay like isocrine like soaked like Aristotle glotto this man their words tear star our thoughts into new Fields okay so we are tall in this way but there is one who stands higher than they why don't you go to the one Higher good as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God God no man had seen God at any time they only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he had declared him John 1 12 and verse 18. we can trace the line of the world's great teachers as far back as human record extends okay we can trace back the line okay and see there was great teachers as far back as human records extend but the light was before them so the Highlight was before before them okay and we're told as the moon and the stars of the solar system Shine by The reflected light of the Sun so as far as their teaching is truth do the world's great thinkers reflect the Rays of the son of righteousness okay all of them got their knowledge and wisdom from the one who is higher just like the sun reflects its rays are bounces Rays upon the solar system so we are told that every Gem of thought every flash of the intellect is from the light of the world in these days we hear much about higher education the true higher education is that impacted by him in whom are heed all Treasures of the with of the will of wisdom and knowledge in him was life and the life was the highlight of men Colossians 2 3 and John chapter 1 verse 4. could he that followeth me would say Jesus shall not work in darkness but shall have the light of life and quote the server is 464 paragraph four we are told that true education is to be established in the last days through education medical missionaries centers of influence must be established in the last days in order for you and me to overcome the Beast and the image please scroll the wall of my that Facebook you will see a study on how to overcome the Beast and how to overcome His Image and how to overcome his name and the number of his name plus himself how to overcome him you must understand

has loved us and has brought us to his side how did he do that that is to the to be the question of to education thank you be welcome in all capacity support the work and send in your means it is

[10.7s] character in the whole world in order to
[12.8s] understand the truth as it is in Jesus
[15.3s] let us see just what we are supposed to

[48.8s] the foundation of Education in Israel we
[52.3s] are going to see if education was
[54.2s] necessary in Israel was it a true
[56.5s] education or was it absent did we have
[59.6s] an education system we're going to see
[61.8s] let us read from the sort of page number
[64.4s] 69 paragraph two you think from the
[67.1s] earliest times the faithful the faithful
[70.0s] in Israel had given much care to the
[72.6s] education of the youth the faithful had
[75.6s] given much care in the education of the
[78.5s] youth okay
[80.5s] the Lord had directed that even from
[83.0s] babyhood the children should be taught
[85.0s] of his goodness and his greatness all
[88.1s] right the CH the from babyhood the
[90.7s] children should be taught of his
[91.8s] goodness and his greatness especially as
[94.5s] revealed in his law the first education
[97.4s] was to teach children from babyhood his
[101.5s] law God's law okay and shown in the
[104.2s] history of Israel okay
[107.5s] I think especially as revealed in his
[110.3s] his law and shown in the history of
[113.3s] Israel how he used to deal with the
[115.3s] Israelite he's saying song and prayer
[117.3s] and lesson from the scriptures were to
[119.8s] be adapted to the opening mind all right
[122.3s] song and prayer to in the heat the
[125.1s] history of Israelites this is just what
[126.8s] happened they used to teach their
[128.6s] children through education based on true
[132.2s] education they used to teach their
[134.1s] children through education God's
[136.2s] goodness based in his law then it is
[138.7s] going on these are overages page 69
[141.3s] paragraph two chain all right
[144.5s] the Lord who had directed that even from
[146.7s] baby who the children should be taught
[148.3s] of his goodness and his greatness
[150.1s] especially as it revealed in his law and
[153.1s] shown in the history of Israel song and
[155.6s] prayer and lessons from the scriptures
[157.4s] were to be adapted to the opening mind
[160.0s] fathers and mothers who are to instruct
[162.4s] their children that the law of God is an
[165.5s] expression of his character all right
[167.6s] the law of God was an expression of his
[171.1s] character then he's saying and that as
[173.5s] they receive the principles of the law
[175.3s] into the heart the image of God was
[177.7s] stressed on mind and soul
[180.2s] that is the essence as to why Jesus came
[183.1s] to die on the cross to restore the image
[186.2s] of God in man all right
[190.0s] both in the mind and in the soul much of
[192.5s] the teaching was oral but the youth also
[195.4s] learned to read the Hebrew writing they
[199.1s] learn how to read and write in short not
[201.5s] it is not essential to read
[203.6s] Hebrew in order to understand faith in
[205.6s] Jesus
[206.5s] it is an emphasis of on writing and
[210.2s] reading in order to convey a message so
[212.3s] we are told but the youth also learned
[215.0s] to read the Hebrew writings and the
[217.3s] parchment roles of the Old Testament the
[219.2s] scriptures were open to their study
[222.4s] paragraph three page 69 deservages in
[225.4s] the days of Christ the town or city that
[228.2s] did not provide for the religious
[229.6s] instruction of the young was regarded as
[231.8s] Under The Curse Of God yet the teaching
[234.0s] had become formal so in a education just
[237.5s] as today people required regard those
[239.8s] who did not receive education as low
[242.3s] right now we can see it just this
[245.3s] similarly with we read it it was in
[248.3s] Israel so we are reading it's saying yet
[251.0s] the teaching had become formal teaching
[253.2s] had become so tradition had in a great
[256.2s] degree supplanted the scripture
[258.2s] tradition had supplanted the scripture
[261.4s] okay so tradition what tradition will
[265.0s] always approved through education just
[268.1s] watch as false education is spreading in
[271.1s] the land the True Church of God is going
[272.9s] to spread in the land with tradition of
[275.0s] men putting on skirts anyway well just
[277.9s] going on
[279.0s] we are told tradition had in a great
[281.4s] degree Supply in the scriptures true
[282.9s] education will lead the youth to seek
[285.2s] the Lord what seek the Lord if happily
[287.6s] they might feel after him and find him
[289.7s] acts 17 verse 27 and quote but the
[293.0s] Jewish teachers gave the attention to
[294.9s] the matters of ceremony the mind was
[297.1s] crowded with material all right so we
[300.2s] are told that education was in Israel
[304.4s] let us see just what happened
[307.9s] that education in Israel during the time
[311.4s] of Jesus got corrupt got corrupted uh
[314.8s] before we read that I'm going to open
[316.5s] with a scripture that says John 7 verse
[319.0s] number John 7. verse number
[322.2s] uh verse 10 it's saying but when his
[326.3s] Brethren were gone up then when he was
[328.6s] up and to the fists not openly but as it
[331.4s] were in secret then verse 11 then the
[333.7s] Jesus sought him at the feast and said
[335.3s] where is he and verse 12 and he
[338.9s] and there was much murmuring among the
[340.9s] Jews concerning him for some said he is
[343.7s] a good man others saying no but he
[346.0s] deceived the people all right so through
[347.9s] education versus false education let's
[350.6s] see verse number 14 verse 13 John 7 13
[353.5s] how we eat no man speak openly of him
[356.8s] for fear of the Jews all right they
[358.6s] feared because he had the true education
[360.5s] and the Jews had adopted another
[363.1s] education we will see if it is true or
[365.4s] false we're going to read just from our
[367.1s] resources we're saying verse 14. now
[369.8s] about the midst of the Feast of in the
[372.3s] Middle East of the feast in the Middle
[374.0s] East of the feast Jesus went up into the
[376.9s] temple and taught
[378.5s] so people are not taught these things so
[381.1s] he went up in the middies of the Fists
[383.5s] in the middle when it is climax he went
[386.9s] to teach
[388.0s] the doctrine of true education he went
[390.9s] to teach according to True education
[393.3s] that God had directed so this let's go
[397.1s] and see what he thought how he thought
[400.0s] verse 15 and the Jews Marvel saying how
[402.2s] no this man let us having never learned
[405.4s] I don't know this man let us having
[407.5s] never learned so Jesus
[409.4s] never went to the school of the Jews so
[413.0s] as we read in the set of Ages page 80
[415.4s] that Jesus the rabbits knew Jesus never
[418.4s] attended their schools as now we are
[421.0s] going to see just how Jesus taught
[425.9s] ah this is the services page 70.1 it is
[430.0s] saying the Child Jesus did not receive
[431.5s] instruction in the synagogue schools
[433.6s] never
[434.8s] why we are going to find out
[437.5s] a lot much much more he's saying
[440.6s] his mother was his first human teacher
[442.7s] from her lips and from the Scrolls of
[444.7s] the prophet he learned of heavenly
[446.8s] things the very Words which he himself
[448.9s] had spoken to Moses for Israel was for
[451.7s] Israel he was now taught at his mother's
[454.7s] knee okay so Jesus is receiving the true
[457.4s] education home schooling
[459.5s] homeschooling
[461.1s] all right so he's saying he was now
[463.4s] taught at his mother's knee as he
[465.5s] Advanced from childhood to youth he did
[467.7s] not seek the schools of the rabbis all
[470.2s] right as he Advanced from childhoods to
[472.4s] youth he did not seek the schools of the
[474.7s] rabies he needed not the education to be
[476.8s] obtained from such sources okay for God
[479.8s] was his instructor all right now those
[483.1s] are that is the spirit of true
[485.3s] Reformation
[486.8s] Spirit of Tourism our schools are
[489.2s] teaching religion from the East
[492.3s] and some parents are not aware of this
[494.7s] we are parents we are not even checking
[496.8s] the books our children are learning
[498.8s] baptism infant baptism those are pagan
[502.2s] Pagan things that are inherited by the
[505.0s] Catholicism called Catholic but that is
[507.4s] Pagan Pagan my friend they are learning
[510.8s] how to communicate with the Dead how to
[513.1s] communicate with Spirits they call it
[515.5s] Spirits have you have you checked those
[517.5s] books we are going to open those books
[520.8s] line upon line I'm going to screen them
[523.9s] up and to bring them up in the as
[526.4s] facilities are going to be brought in
[529.1s] God is going to send servants who are
[531.9s] going to serve in different capacity
[534.5s] machines are going to be here and we're
[537.0s] going to expose all that whatever
[539.0s] achieving and learning now we are in in
[541.6s] the book The salvages page number 70.1
[544.8s] it ends and says I see advance from
[547.1s] childhood to youth he did not seek the
[549.2s] school of the rabbis he needed not the
[551.2s] education to be obtained from such
[553.5s] sausage for God was this instruction
[556.4s] the question asked during the same the
[558.8s] savior's Ministry
[565.2s] how now is this man let us having Never
[567.4s] Land does not indicate that Jesus was
[569.4s] unable to read but merely that he had
[571.7s] not received a rabbinical education they
[573.8s] never saw Jesus in their schools because
[576.2s] in that time as in the previous video
[578.8s] that I just gave out was the kingdom of
[582.0s] the Greeks the Greeks had colonized the
[584.0s] old Earth and the old Earth had been
[585.6s] hellenized it has the Earth had received
[588.3s] a Greek education with its tradition and
[591.2s] and rights but then we are going to see
[594.6s] how Israelites had made an alliance with
[598.6s] the Fallen Nation Greek and Roman Empire
[601.8s] let's go and see we are going to
[603.9s] understand events that transpire in the
[606.5s] time of Jesus
[608.0s] foreshadowed the time of the 144 we are
[611.8s] going to see if these things
[614.6s] show just our duties
[617.5s] it continues how nice this does not
[620.2s] indicate that Jesus was unable to read
[621.9s] me but merely that he had received he
[624.2s] had not received merely he had not
[626.5s] received a rabbinical education John 17
[629.1s] 7 verse 15. since he gained knowledge as
[632.8s] we may do his intimate intimate
[635.5s] acquaintance with the scripture shows
[637.7s] how diligently his early years were
[640.7s] given to the study of God's word okay
[643.1s] okay and spread out before him was The
[646.7s] Great Library of God's created works all
[649.5s] right he who had made all things started
[652.1s] the lessons which is on hand had written
[654.4s] in art and sky under sky and and sea and
[657.3s] sky apart from the Unholy ways of the
[660.4s] world he gathered stones of scientific
[662.4s] knowledge from nature he studied the
[665.3s] life of plants and animals and the life
[668.0s] of man from his earliest year he was
[670.9s] possessed of one purpose he lived to
[674.2s] bless others for this he found resources
[677.0s] in nature for this he found resources in
[680.9s] nature new ideas of ways and means
[683.3s] flushed into his mind as he studied
[685.9s] plant as he studied the plant all right
[690.1s] um so it is a study plan for this he
[692.5s] found resources in nature new ideas of
[694.2s] ways and means flashed into his mind as
[696.4s] he studied plant life and animal life
[698.1s] continually he was seeking to draw from
[700.9s] things sin illustration by which he
[704.4s] presents the living Oracles of God how
[707.0s] to teach the truth of Heaven he had to
[709.0s] learn he had to learn as a human he had
[711.5s] to see just what human beings are
[714.2s] acquainted to in order to teach them the
[717.7s] things of heaven then he said
[719.0s] continually he was seeking to draw
[720.6s] something seen illustration by which he
[723.2s] to present the living Oracles of God
[725.2s] linking the Heavenly things with the
[728.0s] Earthly Jesus had to take time with that
[730.7s] in order to know our weaknesses he had
[733.3s] to take all that time
[736.2s] all three years of ministration
[739.5s] to finalize everything he's God my
[743.0s] friend but all of us combined we can't
[746.5s] finish studying these art actually
[748.4s] recently the scientists started
[750.7s] discovering some other organism in under
[752.9s] the sea that had been existing so it it
[756.2s] is not even in reckon they are already
[758.2s] putting it in the record so that finding
[760.1s] out new on new things yet Jesus took
[762.7s] three years to teach
[764.2s] the Oracle of heaven so we are told this
[768.3s] okay he studied plant life fast forward
[771.2s] The Parables by which during his
[773.4s] ministry he loved to teach his lessons
[775.7s] of Truth show how open his Spirit was to
[778.5s] the influences of Nature and how he had
[780.8s] gathered the spiritual teaching from the
[783.0s] surrounding of his daily life so we see
[785.5s] Jesus have obtaining true education in
[789.7s] nature right now as you are watching as
[792.4s] you have seen just right around us this
[796.1s] is nature we are planning and we are
[798.8s] already in the ground breaking the
[801.0s] ground in order that the this place may
[803.9s] be viable for True education and for you
[808.4s] you can see we had already begun a
[812.0s] modern toilet this is a building of a
[815.8s] modern toilet it is under construction
[817.8s] and right in front of you on the other
[821.5s] side of me you can see we had a
[824.3s] structure a simple structure The Lord Is
[827.2s] Us directing us to make simple structure
[832.1s] for True education we are told as we
[835.0s] make two we make ground for True
[837.2s] education the Lord will send help let
[839.6s] those who have meetings bring their
[841.9s] means in order to glorify God to see
[844.3s] just what we have to do in this last day
[848.2s] and how we should know that these things
[851.5s] are taking place are to take place read
[854.9s] the signs of the time and knowing the
[857.1s] time Romans chapter 13 11 knowing the
[860.9s] time that that day is so closer
[864.4s] then we should allow arise from let's
[868.9s] not sleep for the sleeping virgins to
[871.7s] arise they must know the time in which
[873.4s] they are living in so
[875.6s] we are just uh seeing the education
[878.6s] system that Jesus did not receive and
[882.4s] the education system which is true that
[885.4s] Jesus received as a young alien boy
[890.1s] so let me go fast forward to see
[895.0s] just what the education the type of
[898.3s] education that Jesus received the same
[900.8s] same book these are of Ages we are going
[903.5s] to sing the book called Desire of Ages
[906.4s] page 86 paragraph two
[910.0s] the type of education was it a lower
[913.4s] education style was it a middle
[916.9s] education or was it a higher education
[919.4s] and what is high education let's see uh
[923.1s] the surveys page number 86 paragraph two
[926.5s] it goes saying his brothers are the sons
[929.4s] of Joseph were called sided with the
[931.6s] rabbis they insisted that the tradition
[933.5s] must be heated as if they were the
[935.9s] requirements of God they even regarded
[937.9s] the precepts of men more highly than the
[939.8s] word of God and they were greatly
[941.6s] annoyed at the clear penetration of
[943.2s] Jesus in distinguishing between the
[945.3s] false and the true all right so true
[947.2s] education enables you to distinguish
[949.0s] true and false his strict obedience to
[951.7s] the law of God they condemned as
[953.6s] stubbornness that was a reformer my
[955.5s] friend that was a reformer
[957.5s] they were surprised at the knowledge and
[959.7s] wisdom he showed in answering the
[961.5s] rubbish they knew that he had not
[963.3s] received instruction from the wise men
[965.2s] yet they could not but see that he was
[967.9s] an instructor to them okay so he was an
[970.7s] instructor why because of the education
[973.4s] system which he had learned from his
[976.3s] babyhood to his manhood
[979.4s] through his youthful uh alive he's
[982.7s] saying
[985.4s] the chain from the wife yet they could
[988.4s] not but see that he was an instructor to
[990.4s] them to the rabbis they recognized that
[993.1s] his education was of a higher time
[995.9s] than their own
[997.9s] all right they recognized that his
[1001.6s] education was of a higher type than
[1004.6s] their own but they did not decide that
[1007.0s] he had access to the Tree of Life okay
[1010.9s] so there is something known as the Tree
[1013.7s] of Life yesterday as we are doing our
[1015.7s] series we realized that in the Garden of
[1017.9s] Eden there was a tree fast the tree of
[1020.6s] knowledge second the tree of life so we
[1023.5s] have the tree of false and true and we
[1027.0s] have the tree of pain that perpetuates
[1030.0s] life so we are seeing that the book The
[1032.6s] the that in the garden of Heaven had
[1034.9s] Eden we see that there was a section of
[1038.5s] instruction Where Angels often Revisited
[1041.2s] in order to instruct Adam and Eve then
[1043.9s] we can understand all the prophetic
[1046.5s] patterns are exact and
[1050.3s] all striking at the same level just as
[1054.0s] we are in order to inherit life we have
[1056.6s] to avoid the mixed education that is
[1060.3s] mixed true and false and we have to go
[1063.7s] straight to the Tree of Life which
[1066.0s] represented Christ Jesus all right so we
[1069.7s] are seeing but they did not discern that
[1072.3s] he had access to the Tree of Life a
[1074.2s] source of knowledge of which they were
[1076.0s] ignorant okay so Christ was not
[1079.0s] exclusive and he had given special
[1081.4s] offense to the Pharisees by departing in
[1084.0s] his respect from their rigid rules he
[1086.7s] found the domain of religion fans in by
[1089.3s] high walls of seclusion as to Sacred a
[1091.6s] matter for everyday life these words of
[1093.8s] petition he overthrew true education
[1096.3s] will overthrow petition okay was of
[1100.9s] petition or self-service true education
[1104.3s] will not serve serve true education will
[1106.9s] serve others the nation will be rid of
[1111.7s] bribery rib of corruption even your own
[1114.3s] child will not bribe you therefore you
[1117.1s] will have
[1118.6s] fruits of true education the Treaty of
[1121.5s] life we love we love its bearing upon a
[1124.1s] nation like this
[1126.2s] let us see just what true education did
[1129.5s] in the life of Jesus we want to see just
[1132.3s] what it was okay uh we are seeing from
[1136.6s] the book called The sarovated the
[1138.6s] Simpson book
[1141.1s] uh seeing
[1143.2s] the type uh the education system of
[1145.9s] Jesus what it did to him and others all
[1149.4s] right was it self-service of others
[1152.1s] the Jewish that is deserve Ages page 317
[1156.3s] paragraph three it is saying this way it
[1159.0s] is saying the Jews had been instructed
[1160.9s] from childhood concerning the work of
[1162.7s] the Messiah all right so true education
[1165.1s] she will teach you the work of Jesus the
[1169.0s] work of Salvation the true service the
[1172.0s] work in which your soul and mind is to
[1175.2s] be saved like likewise we are seeing the
[1177.9s] Jews were taught from childhood
[1179.3s] concerning the work of the Mississauga
[1181.2s] they inspired utterances so Patrick and
[1183.8s] Prophets and the symbolic teaching of
[1185.5s] the sacrificial service had been theirs
[1188.0s] they were learning in the symbolic
[1189.8s] teaching in this in the synagogue I mean
[1193.0s] or in the temple here we are told in the
[1195.6s] temple they were learning all these
[1197.8s] sacrificial service
[1199.6s] so this object lesson about the Messiah
[1202.6s] but they had disregarded the light and
[1206.4s] now they saw in Jesus nothing to be
[1208.6s] desired but the Centurion burning
[1211.3s] Hedonism Centurion was born in Hidden
[1214.3s] can you see that Centurion the Centurion
[1217.7s] we know that the Sanhedrin was full of
[1221.1s] leaders who were given for self-service
[1224.8s] now here at the side of which shows us
[1227.7s] that the Centurion burning Hedonism
[1230.7s] educated in the idolatry of Imperial Ron
[1234.1s] all right so they were indicated by the
[1236.1s] Roman trained as a soldier seemingly cut
[1239.2s] off from spiritual life by his education
[1241.2s] and surroundings and still further shot
[1243.3s] out by the begoty of the Jews and by the
[1245.8s] content of his own countrymen for the
[1248.1s] people of Israel this man
[1250.2s] perceived the truth to which the
[1253.2s] children of Abraham were blinded so
[1255.2s] there was a Roman Centurion this Roman
[1257.5s] Centurion was
[1259.2s] he learned from a hidden background his
[1263.6s] background is based on Hedonism
[1265.5s] therefore what happened he did not wait
[1268.4s] to see whether he the Jews themselves
[1270.7s] will receive the one who claimed to be
[1272.9s] their Messiah so the question is we want
[1275.1s] to see that the true what true education
[1278.0s] imparted in the life of Jesus we are
[1280.0s] seeing that in his life he had to impact
[1282.7s] the Tree of Life to others through
[1285.1s] understanding true education like was
[1288.2s] even unto us we have to impart the light
[1290.4s] unto the World by understanding just
[1293.2s] what true education can do to us and our
[1296.0s] own children if our children received to
[1298.0s] education that will be true love cry but
[1301.1s] if they receive no true education they
[1303.4s] will fail in the courts when they will
[1305.8s] they shall be summoned before the loyal
[1308.2s] before the Great Men of the Earth
[1311.4s] so this Centurion we are told that the
[1313.8s] Centurion accessed Jesus he did not care
[1317.2s] whether they use themselves will receive
[1319.3s] the one who claimed to be their Messer
[1321.1s] as the light which lighted every man
[1323.5s] that coming into the world John 1 9. had
[1326.9s] shown upon him he had though far off the
[1329.9s] Sun the glory of the Son of God so Jesus
[1332.2s] reflected the glory
[1334.3s] of his father okay to the lost the
[1337.8s] Centurion was a Roman soldier at a
[1340.6s] capacity of centurion this is a capacity
[1343.2s] the title of centurion uh sorry I just
[1346.9s] blinded it as if it was a sun heading
[1349.3s] but Centurion was the class of I mean it
[1354.1s] was a category of soldiers who had their
[1356.6s] duty to be done and they were called
[1358.3s] Centurion there were those who were
[1359.7s] called uh other names but now this is a
[1362.2s] centurion okay okay so we are told that
[1364.8s] Jesus
[1366.4s] Jesus a type of education had been that
[1370.6s] of imparting the blessings of Heaven
[1374.7s] so what is higher education what does
[1377.5s] the spiritual prophecy describe as
[1379.5s] higher education we at all in the book
[1381.9s] called this Center of Ages page 464
[1385.0s] paragraph four it goes on and says that
[1388.4s] was the True Light which lighted every
[1390.5s] man that cometh into the world quote the
[1393.5s] world had the world has had its great
[1396.0s] teachers men of giant elect and
[1398.1s] wonderful research men whose utterances
[1400.2s] have stimulated thought and open to view
[1402.1s] fast fields of knowledge and this men
[1404.5s] have been honored as guides and many
[1406.6s] factors of their race okay
[1409.3s] like isocrine like soaked like Aristotle
[1413.6s] glotto
[1415.2s] this man their words tear star our
[1418.9s] thoughts
[1419.8s] into new Fields okay so we are tall in
[1423.2s] this way but there is one who stands
[1425.4s] higher than they why don't you go to the
[1427.5s] one Higher
[1429.2s] good as many as received him to them
[1431.5s] gave he power to become the sons of God
[1433.2s] God no man had seen God at any time they
[1436.3s] only begotten son which is in the bosom
[1437.9s] of the father he had declared him John 1
[1440.6s] 12 and verse 18.
[1443.8s] we can trace the line of the world's
[1445.6s] great teachers as far back as human
[1447.1s] record extends okay we can trace back
[1451.4s] the line
[1453.3s] okay
[1454.8s] and see there was great teachers as far
[1456.9s] back as human records extend but the
[1458.4s] light was before them
[1459.9s] so the Highlight was before before them
[1462.7s] okay
[1465.0s] and we're told as the moon and the stars
[1468.8s] of the solar system Shine by The
[1470.2s] reflected light of the Sun so as far as
[1472.7s] their teaching is truth do the world's
[1474.7s] great thinkers reflect the Rays of the
[1476.5s] son of righteousness
[1477.9s] okay all of them got their knowledge and
[1481.5s] wisdom from the one who is higher just
[1484.2s] like the sun reflects its rays are
[1486.9s] bounces Rays upon the solar system so we
[1489.7s] are told that every Gem of thought every
[1492.1s] flash of the intellect is from the light
[1493.7s] of the world in these days we hear much
[1496.3s] about higher education the true higher
[1498.8s] education is that impacted by him in
[1501.1s] whom are heed all Treasures of the with
[1502.9s] of the will of wisdom and knowledge in
[1505.3s] him was life and the life was the
[1507.2s] highlight of men Colossians 2 3 and John
[1509.8s] chapter 1 verse 4.
[1511.8s] could he that followeth me would say
[1514.8s] Jesus shall not work in darkness but
[1516.6s] shall have the light of life and quote
[1518.2s] the server is 464 paragraph four we are
[1521.7s] told that true education is to be
[1526.1s] established in the last days
[1529.1s] through education
[1531.1s] medical missionaries
[1533.2s] centers of influence must be established
[1535.7s] in the last days in order

[1572.6s] has brought us
[1574.3s] to his side
[1576.1s] how did he do that
