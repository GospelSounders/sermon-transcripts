the truth but who feel no special burden to reveal corresponding works will be like that servant who knew his master's will but did it not messika foreign [Music] foreign desire of ages desire of aegis page 36 paragraph two desire of edges that six point two in the same are the people whom god had called to the to be the pillar and ground of truth had become representatives of satan they were doing the work that he desired them to do taking a course to misrepresent the character of god and caused the world to look upon him as a tyrant the very priests who ministered in the temple had lost sight of the significance of the service if they performed they had ceased to look beyond the symbol to the things signified in presenting the sacrificial offerings they were as actors in a play the ordinances which god himself had appointed were made the means of blinding the mind and hardening the heart god could do no more for man through these channels the whole system must be swept away in a s i want to link them with this parable which we are studying another parable about it soma verse 12. they had healed themselves systems that could no longer hold water now a certain man held a great supper just happened now this is one of the parables i'm going to link israel in the seventh day adventism at the end of time one of the parables i'm going to link israel in the seventh day adventism yes in in in in parables trying to link those who shall live at the end of time tonight luke chapter 14. luke chapter 14 jesus gave another parable to link these happenings and occurrences luke chapter 14 verses number 16 luke chapter 14 verses number 16 amen amen a certain man made a great supper this is not breakfast this is not lunch hour call this is supper time now on a somatic chapter 20 that great clock began early hour in the morning until the 11th hour labourers that is nearing the supper time the 11th hour 9 11. no no it begins at early morning breakfast the great advent millerite movement the sixth hour laborers and then when it's nearing supper time just before the 11th hour laborers are called in that is where luke chapter 14 features because this parable is mentioning the great supper that has been beaten to call people in okay this is a special message for god's people who have been given much light at the end of time so this message is god gives another final bid to them first listen to this a certain man made a great supper not a great breakfast not a great lunch hour meal it is a great supper so this parable must be put in its proper location high tomorrow then he called and sent his servant at supper time supper time not breakfast supper time when it's it is nearing the 11th hour in upper caribbean when it is nearing the supper time put these things in your mind i come to mom tomorrow cool at great supper time i wanna all things are ready come to the supper time all things are ready my friends the bible teaches that god has prepared a message at suppertime for seventh-day adventism god intends to bring this message to god's people moon attacker quality what god is talking about the bible says i have bought a piece of field it must needs that i go and see it fast okay that is the first group i have bought a field the first group the second group of individuals they have bought oxen they must go and see them and test them i pray forgive me i am not coming to the great supper this message is preached first to adventism it is not it is not preached to the world at first within jerusalem okay these are three categories of people in adventism a letter message yes [Music] in another parable let's just expound on the field that is being brought here they have volta field they must go and see the field and how it is prospering i have no time for that message okay the field that is brought luke chapter number 12. okay luke chapter number luke chapter number 12 verses number two verses from versus number 16 luke chapter 12 verses number 16. the first group of individuals have bought a field okay so they don't see the great invitation at supper time okay there is a great message just before the crisis just before the loud cry of the third angel goes forth god brings this sort of message as supper time but the first group of individuals on a semano we have just bought a field these are the first group of individuals in adventism because what shall i do sit down my soul relax eat and drink your grounds has brought a lot of increase you are rich and increased with goods satan has blinded their eyes to the things of the world they cannot appreciate the things that are of eternal interest at supper time okay and it's not just any other message god will bring in the message that will arouse god's people to go back to their foundational truths you see jesus was the foundation of the whole jewish economy but the israelites why would you come qatar yes their foundation they had rejected him and they remained to be fig trees with the leaves and without without fruits meat for repentance so how i wanted look at luke chapter 12 verse 21 it continues to say devio um verses number 24 the bible says the billionaire seymour luke chapter 12 those who lay up treasures on earth and they are not uh they are not rich towards god we must be very keen that this invitation comes between the ninth and the eleventh hour there is a message that god must bring to his people just to arouse them just to show them that it is time to prepare for the loud cry of the third angel but the first group of individuals on a semapana sisi took on amalia dunya okay took on amalia dunya okay the bible says in luke chapter 21 verse 34. luke 21 verses number 34 luke 21 verse 34 in a semester take heed unto yourselves jesus said that your hearts may not be overcharged with the suffering drunkenness and the things of this earth that that day shall come upon you unawares for us as near shall it come upon all that dwell upon the earth in adventism we are told okay in the book in the book ali writings writings in the book early writings we are told early writings amen early writings in the book ali writings or spiritual gifts we are told page 267 ali writings 267 paragraph number 266 paragraph 1 early writings 266 paragraph 1 i saw that satan baby's angels lay their snares especially for those who are looking for christ's second appearing and keeping all the commandments of god satan told his angels that the churches were asleep what the churches were asleep he would increase his power and lying wonders and he could hold them but he said the sect of sabbath keep us we hate they are continuously working against us and taking from us our subjects to keep the hated law of god look at what satan does go make the processes of lands and money drunk with the chaos if you can make them place their affections upon these things we shall have them yet they may profess what they please only make them care for money than for the success of christ's kingdom or the spread of the truth we hate present the world before them in the most attractive light that they may love and idolize it we must keep in our ranks all the means of which we can gain control the more means the followers of christ devote to his service the more will they injure our kingdom by getting our subjects that one disqualifies them from the great supper and that specific message about a moon on a letter at supper time it is a message to revive and reform god's people let's go back to the book of matthew chapter 14. to build on this matthew chapter 14 remember this is part one of the topic nominal adventism or the remnant takuya conglomerate part two i'm just building luke chapter 14 verses matthew 14 sorry versus number 23 at suppertime there is a message to arouse the people in the ship and jesus went to arouse the people in the boat that lacked faith in that particular ship now on a suffering america jesus had to come to them and why that is why we see ellen white writing in the book last day events page 210 paragraph one let me just read it again to connect supper time a message that will give the baron fig tree hope of not being cut spare it this year also the fourth year is the probationary the fourth message that fourth angel must arrive in history to give hope to god's people and to arouse them from their spiritual liturgy last day events page 210 paragraph one last events page 210 lde page 210 paragraph 1 then we'll go to those who have married a wife and then we'll build our topic from there as to why israel must be cut if it does not produce fruits meat for repentance last day events page 210 paragraph number one paragraph okay lde to 10 209 i say sorry lde 209 oh sorry i had ticked a book early writings let me just untick first yes last day events to 10 lde to 10.1 what is the message that god must bring here at the end of time it says it's also from review and herald in a talk review and herald may 27 1890 okay she says there is to be in the seventh-day adventist churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of god and but it will not move upon those who have not humbled themselves before the lord and opened the door of the heart by confession and repentance she says in the manifestation of that power which lightens the earth with the glory of god they will see only something which in their blindness they think dangerous something which will arouse their fears and they will brace themselves to resist it because the law does not work in accordance to their ideas and expectations they will oppose the work why they say should we not know the spirit of god when we have been in the work for so many years then listens she says anasema the third angel's message will not be comprehended the light which will lighten the earth with its glory will be called a false light by those who refuse to walk in its advancing glory sasa there is a message that is to come at supper time but the rich and increased with the goods on assam associated the other category of individuals these three categories of individuals they will continue to show the green leaves look at the third group of individuals we go back to luke chapter 14. we are reached and increased with good and have need of nothing we don't want that invitation to take that is the problem with laodicea you see it is fatal blindness nasa's spiritual prophet and we put things in order luke chapter 14 look at the third group of individuals in adventism is what is hindering the third group of individuals from heeding that invitation that jesus has suddenly come to his temple to arouse them that is disqualifying them [Music] from becoming partakers of this particular message okay let us build this from the bible revelation 14 verse 4. revelation chapter 14. revelation 14 concerning god's people in the last days the bible teaches others these are they which are not defiled with women for they are virgins they profess a pure holy faith they cannot be married to the women of the land this has been a problem in all ages and this is one of the reasons as to why at supper time some will forfeit the invitation and they will disqualify themselves in giving the third angel's message marrying wives strange women in the bible we see people doing that solomon loved many strange women he disqualified himself and god questioned him we see israel doing the same in the times of ezra let's build this in the bible let's build this in the bible we see it happen in the times of ezra the bible teaches that they marry strange women i've just quoted king solomon in in first kings chapter 11 verse 1. that is king solomon and again we see in the times of ezra nehemiah in the times of ezra nehemiah we see the holy seed mingling itself with strange women we are in the book of ezra now uniforte visuri the third group is saying we have married wives we have just married ezra chapter 9 verses 1 and 2. this has been repeated over and over and over and over in the history of god's people marrying women strange wives ezra chapter nine moon ezra chapter nine the bahrain fig tree is it nominal adventist or the remnant first samuel second samuel first king second kings ezra nehemiah we are in the book of ezra second kings i am handling first kings first second kings first chronicles second chronicles then ezra ezra chapter nine amen to kopali mandika and i say my a entered into an abomination of marrying the wives of the land in the parable of luke chapter 4 14 the third group says we have married wives they have joined themselves into apostate protestantism and they have accepted their doctrines they have accepted to be one with them you see bibliona and get this very carefully is one of the reasons as to why god must raise the people to give the loud cry of the third angel it's one of the reasons you see we are told we are told in testimonies for the church volume 4 page 2 11 paragraph 2 testimonies 40 testimonies for the church volume 4 page number 211 paragraph number two we are told we are told we are told and listen very carefully we are told i'm beginning from paragraph number one it is satan's plan to weaken the faith of god's people in the testimonies next follows skepticism in regard to the vital points of our faith the pillars of our positions then doubted us to the holy scriptures and then the downward march to perdition when the testimonies which were once believed are doubted and given up satan knows the deceived ones will not stop at this and redoubles its efforts till he launches them into an open rebellion which becomes incurable and ends into destruction satan gained marked advantage in because the people of god have not guarded the outposts the very men whose labors god has signified that he would accept if they were fully concentrated have been the ones to be deceived to fail in their duties and to prove a terrible burden and discouragement instead of the help and blessing that they should have been these men who have been trusted to keep the fought have well now betrayed it into the hands of the enemy that awaited us betrayal they have betrayed god into the hands of the enemy they have opened the gates to a willie four enemy who has sought to destroy them men of experience have seen stealthy hands sleeping the balls that satan might enter yet they have held their peace with apparent indifference as to the results some have been glad to see this as it seemed an extenuation of their past neglect which made it a necessity to call for others to fill the posts of responsibility that they had abused or neglected they have betrayed to the enemy they have married themselves to the wives wives testimonies volume 8. near the fallen churches it makes adventists to become nominal wannabe representatives hawana they have nothing that can show totally that these are god's people they remain in name wakanda append testimonies testimonies volume 8 80 page 249 ht page 249 paragraph number three testimonies volume 8 page 249 paragraph 3 in a sema the heavenly teachers inquire what stronger delusion can beguile the mind than the pretence that that you are building on the route right foundation and that god accepts your works when in reality you are working out many things are called according to worldly policy and are sinning against jehovah oh it is a great deception amen they are saying they have married okay it is a great deception a fanaticism a fascinating delusion that takes possessions of the mind when men who have once known the truth must take the form of godliness for the spirit and power thereof when they suppose that they are rich and increased with goods and in need of nothing while in reality they are in need of everything god has not changed toward his faithful servants who are keeping their garments spotless but many are crying peace and safety while sudden destruction is coming upon them shaw kai mayweak or conomit unless there is a thorough repentance unless men humble their hearts by confession and receiving the truth as it is in jesus they will never enter heaven who can truthfully say our gold is tried in the fire our garments are unspotted by the world i saw our instructor pointing to the garments of so-called self-righteousness stripping them off he laid bare the defilement beneath then he said to me can you not see how they are potentially pretentiously covered up the defilement and rottenness of character how is the faithful city become unharlot my father's house is made a house of mechanized a place once the divine presence and glory have departed for this cause there is weakness and strength is lacking what we lack power and strength that cometh from heaven great controversy page 536 great controversy page 536 foreign makatika science of the times february 19 1894

scriptures the great i am as decided what shall be shall constitute the rule of faith and doctrine and he has designed that the bible shall be a household book the church that holds to the word of god is irreconcilably irreconcilably separated from rome protestants were once thus apart from this great church of apostasy but they have approached more nearly to her and are still in the path of reconciliation to the church of rome rome never changes her principles have not altered in the in the list she has not lessened the breach between herself and protestants they have done all the advancing but what does this argue for the protestantism of this day it is the rejection of bible truth which makes man approach to infidelity it is a backsliding church that lessens the distance between itself and the papacy i'm a distance it is about sliding church s is barren however we are not to enter into any core in any nato in uh coalitions with the fallen churches of the world nadia nona kartika statements that are the nominal adventists will unite with the fallen churches early writings page 270 paragraph 2 early writings page 2 170 aloft to read good early writings page 270 paragraph number two it says uh sorry it's 261.1 all the writings page 261 amen early writings page 261 paragraph one listen to this she says she says this is one of the profound statements in the spirit of prophecy i saw that god has honest children among the nominal adventists and the fallen churches i saw that god has honest children among nominal adventists and the fallen churches could have fallen churches nominal adventists and before the plagues shall be poured out ministers and the people will be called out from these churches and will gladly receive the truth satan knows this and before the loud cry of the third angel is given he raises an excitement in these religious bodies that those who have rejected the truth may think that god is with them he hopes to deceive the honest and lead them to think that god is still working for the churches but the light will shine and all who are honest will leave the fallen churches and take their stand with the remnant fallen churches the nominal adventists the fallen churches or the remnant in early ratings 261 paragraph one early ratings 261.1 nominal adventists the remnant because we are looking at the parable of the fig tree and we are seeing that in is it nominal adventism or is it the remnant the bar in fig tree why would you say look at these people in fact they are barren they are dry one kawka na it's a great deception these people jesus said they were terms they used to to to to paint the tombs white the sepulchers okay john chapter 8 from verse 40 41 and 42 john chapter 8 from verses number 40 continuing amen as we continue with part one is it nominal adventists of the remnant the parable of the bahrain fig tree john chapter 8 verses number 40 ekiti the bible says let me let me let me read from verses number uh 37 yes verses 8-10 ezekiel chapter 5 verses 8 to 10 manabi mese ezekiel chapter 5 verses 8 to 10 this is part 1 part 2 will follow shortly ezekiel chapter 5 verses 1 verses 8 to 10. upon thee even the entire world will be amazed because of the abominations ambassador mephania thou has forsaken me the fountain of water and thou has healed myself systems that cannot hold water jeremiah chapter 11 verse 9 to 13 continues as we prepare to wind up this part one tuna pujianda jeremiah 11. jeremiah chapter 11 [Music] verses 9 to verses number 13 amen secretary they have brought evil upon themselves they have forsaken the covenant that i made with their fathers they have were gone into the worship of other gods they have forsaken me i will bring evil upon these people you see john says to the children of israel the ax is laid upon the root when we come back we are going to begin reading in testimonies volume a to see when the tree is going to be cut down officially let me finish by reading one more statement from the spirit of prophecy desire of ages a common statement in deserved ages deserve ages uh page page number 232 these are vegas 232 ages 232 the three groups of adventists that have rejected the light at supper time then god says go in fact we are finishing off back in luke chapter 14 sorry so that the foundation is lied well for the next study it will come from singular of zuri ana if they lead us in israel deserve ages 231 paragraph three if the leaders in israel had received christ he would have honored them as his messengers to carry the gospel to the world to them faust was given the opportunity to become heralds of the kingdom of grace of god but israel knew not the time of her visitation the jealousy and distrust of the jewish leaders had ripened into open hatred and the hearts of the people were turned away from jesus who heard the truth the sanhedrin had rejected christ's message and was bent upon his death therefore jesus departed from jerusalem from the priests the temple the religious leaders the people who had been instructed in the law and turned to another class to proclaim his message and to gather out those who should carry the gospel to the other nations let's go back to matthew chapter 14 as we wind up matthew chapter 14 luke chapter 14 sorry luke chapter 14 what happened the second work is to be done in the same city not outside the city the same city leave the rich and those who are increased with the goods in the same city go and bring those who feel they need the truth what angazia wants you these are the common people the truth of the bible and the spirit of prophets where we are living in prophetic history the first group of individuals shall never taste the supper so the loud cry goes outside but what are the steps let them be aroused to go back to their foundational truths okay the righteousness of christ and the power tell them conferences conference foreign [Music] for part two amen amen

[1781.5s] offerings they were as actors in a play
[1785.1s] the ordinances which god himself had

[2311.3s] they must go and see the field and how
[2313.2s] it is prospering i have no

[2345.3s] the first group of individuals have
[2347.4s] bought a field
[2349.3s] okay
[2350.7s] so
[2356.6s] they don't see the great invitation at
[2359.1s] supper time
[2360.6s] okay there is a great message
[2366.6s] just before the crisis
[2368.7s] just before the loud cry of the third
[2370.6s] angel
[2371.8s] goes forth
[2373.0s] god brings this sort of message as
[2375.0s] supper time
[2376.4s] but the first group of individuals on a
[2378.3s] semano we have just bought a field
[2386.7s] these are the first group of individuals
[2389.2s] in adventism

[2437.7s] your grounds has brought a lot of
[2439.4s] increase you are rich and increased with
[2441.9s] goods

[2447.8s] things of the world they cannot
[2449.5s] appreciate the things that are of
[2451.8s] eternal interest
[2456.6s] at supper time
[2458.2s] okay and it's not just any other message
[2461.1s] god will bring in the message that will
[2464.2s] arouse god's people to go back to their
[2466.5s] foundational truths
[2468.6s] you see jesus was the foundation of the
[2470.5s] whole jewish economy
[2472.2s] but the israelites why would you come
[2474.2s] qatar yes their foundation they had
[2477.4s] rejected him
[2479.1s] and they remained to be
[2481.3s] fig trees with the leaves
[2483.1s] and without
[2485.3s] without fruits meat for repentance
[2488.2s] so how i wanted
[2506.1s] look at luke chapter 12 verse 21
[2509.8s] it continues to say

[2544.2s] we must be very keen
[2546.3s] that this invitation comes between the
[2548.9s] ninth and the eleventh hour there is a
[2550.8s] message that god must bring to his
[2552.5s] people
[2555.2s] just to arouse them
[2557.3s] just to show them
[2559.2s] that it is time
[2561.0s] to prepare
[2562.8s] for the loud cry of the third angel
[2565.2s] but the first group of individuals on a

[2575.4s] okay
[2576.7s] the bible says in luke
[2581.0s] chapter 21 verse 34.
[2584.6s] luke 21 verses number 34
[2588.9s] luke 21 verse 34 in a semester
[2610.0s] take heed unto yourselves jesus said
[2612.4s] that your hearts may not be overcharged
[2615.0s] with the suffering drunkenness and the
[2617.8s] things of this earth that that day shall
[2620.6s] come upon you unawares
[2622.7s] for us as near shall it come upon all
[2626.1s] that dwell upon the earth
[2645.8s] in adventism
[2669.8s] we are told
[2672.2s] okay
[2674.8s] in the book
[2677.3s] in the book ali writings
[2679.9s] writings
[2681.7s] in the book early writings we are told
[2684.7s] early writings
[2686.3s] amen
[2689.2s] early writings
[2692.0s] in the book ali writings or spiritual
[2694.2s] gifts
[2695.5s] we are told page 267
[2698.4s] ali writings 267
[2701.1s] paragraph number 266 paragraph 1 early
[2704.9s] writings 266 paragraph 1
[2707.7s] i saw that satan baby's angels lay their
[2710.5s] snares especially for those who are
[2712.1s] looking for christ's second appearing
[2714.3s] and keeping all the commandments of god
[2717.0s] satan told his angels that the churches
[2719.4s] were asleep what
[2721.5s] the churches were asleep
[2723.2s] he would increase his power and lying
[2725.4s] wonders and he could hold them but
[2730.3s] he said
[2731.6s] the sect of sabbath keep us we hate
[2734.7s] they are continuously working against us
[2737.6s] and taking from us our subjects to keep
[2741.0s] the hated law of god look at what satan
[2743.6s] does
[2744.7s] go
[2745.5s] make the processes of lands and money
[2748.4s] drunk with the chaos
[2750.6s] if you can make them place their
[2752.3s] affections upon these things
[2754.4s] we shall have them yet they may profess
[2758.3s] what they please only make them care for
[2761.0s] money than for the success of christ's
[2763.5s] kingdom or the spread of the truth we
[2766.2s] hate
[2767.0s] present the world before them in the
[2769.1s] most attractive light that they may love
[2772.6s] and idolize it
[2774.5s] we must keep in our ranks
[2777.3s] all the means
[2778.8s] of which we can gain control the more
[2782.1s] means the followers of christ devote to
[2783.9s] his service the more will they injure
[2785.9s] our kingdom by getting our subjects
[2803.0s] that one disqualifies them from the
[2805.4s] great supper and that specific message
[2809.4s] about a moon on a letter at supper time
[2811.4s] it is a message to revive and reform
[2813.8s] god's people let's go back to the book
[2815.4s] of matthew chapter 14.
[2817.6s] to build on this matthew chapter 14
[2819.7s] remember this is part one
[2822.2s] of the topic
[2823.9s] nominal adventism or the remnant takuya
[2826.6s] conglomerate part two i'm just building
[2829.8s] luke chapter 14 verses matthew 14 sorry
[2832.7s] versus number 23
[2835.5s] at suppertime there is a message to
[2837.6s] arouse the people in the ship
[2842.6s] and
[2903.9s] jesus went to arouse the people in the
[2906.2s] boat that
[2907.3s] lacked faith
[2909.0s] in that particular ship now on a
[2911.1s] suffering america jesus had to come to
[2913.8s] them
[2915.2s] and why that is why we see ellen white
[2917.3s] writing in the book last day events page
[2919.3s] 210 paragraph one let me just read it
[2921.0s] again to connect supper time
[2923.7s] a message that will give the baron fig
[2926.2s] tree hope
[2927.8s] of not being cut
[2932.8s] spare it this year also the fourth year
[2937.0s] is the probationary the fourth message
[2940.6s] that fourth angel must arrive in history
[2944.2s] to give hope to god's people and to
[2946.3s] arouse them
[2947.8s] from their spiritual liturgy
[2950.6s] last day events page 210 paragraph one
[2954.7s] last events
[2956.6s] page 210 lde
[2960.3s] page 210
[2962.6s] paragraph 1 then we'll go to those who
[2965.1s] have married a wife
[2967.1s] and then we'll build our topic from
[2968.8s] there as to why israel must be cut
[2972.7s] if it does not produce fruits meat for
[2975.1s] repentance
[2976.7s] last day events page 210
[2979.0s] paragraph number one

[3000.6s] yes last day events to 10
[3004.4s] lde to 10.1
[3007.6s] what is the message
[3009.2s] that god must bring
[3012.3s] here at the end of time it says it's
[3014.2s] also from review and herald in a talk
[3016.2s] review and herald
[3017.7s] may 27 1890
[3020.8s] okay
[3022.6s] she says
[3026.4s] there is to be in the seventh-day
[3028.2s] adventist churches a wonderful
[3029.8s] manifestation of the power of god
[3032.5s] and but it will not move upon those who
[3035.2s] have not humbled themselves before the
[3037.1s] lord and opened the door of the heart by
[3039.2s] confession
[3040.4s] and repentance
[3041.9s] she says
[3043.2s] in the manifestation of that power which
[3046.2s] lightens the earth with the glory of god
[3048.9s] they will see only something which in
[3050.8s] their blindness they think dangerous
[3053.3s] something which will arouse their fears
[3055.8s] and they will brace themselves to resist
[3057.6s] it because the law does not work in
[3059.6s] accordance to their ideas and
[3061.1s] expectations they will oppose the work
[3063.8s] why they say should we not know the
[3066.2s] spirit of god when we have been in the
[3068.4s] work for so many years then listens
[3071.8s] she says anasema the third angel's
[3074.2s] message will not be comprehended the
[3076.2s] light which will lighten the earth with
[3077.8s] its glory will be called a false light
[3079.8s] by those who refuse to walk in its
[3081.5s] advancing glory
[3083.4s] sasa
[3085.4s] there is a message that is to come at
[3087.0s] supper time
[3088.6s] but the rich and increased with the
[3091.0s] goods on assam associated
[3093.5s] the other category of individuals
[3098.2s] these three categories of individuals
[3100.7s] they will continue to show the green
[3102.5s] leaves
[3112.4s] look at the third group of individuals
[3116.2s] we go back to luke chapter 14.
[3127.8s] we are reached and increased with good
[3130.6s] and have need of nothing we don't want
[3133.6s] that invitation
[3135.6s] to take
[3137.8s] that is the problem with laodicea you
[3139.5s] see
[3140.4s] it is fatal blindness nasa's
[3143.3s] spiritual prophet
[3144.9s] and we put things in order
[3148.2s] luke chapter 14
[3150.1s] look at the third group of individuals
[3152.6s] in adventism
[3163.0s] is
[3169.3s] what is hindering the third group of
[3172.2s] individuals
[3173.6s] from heeding that invitation
[3176.7s] that jesus has suddenly come to his
[3179.2s] temple to arouse them
[3210.4s] that is disqualifying them
[3212.3s] [Music]
[3213.7s] from
[3215.8s] becoming
[3217.1s] partakers of this
[3219.1s] particular message
[3221.3s] okay
[3229.4s] let us build this from the bible
[3230.9s] revelation 14 verse 4.
[3234.1s] revelation chapter 14.
[3238.6s] revelation 14
[3240.5s] concerning god's people in the last days
[3242.4s] the bible teaches
[3247.0s] others
[3256.9s] these are they which are not defiled
[3260.2s] with women for they are virgins
[3263.0s] they profess a pure holy faith
[3266.1s] they cannot be married to the women of
[3268.3s] the land this has been a problem in all
[3271.0s] ages and this is one of the reasons as
[3273.4s] to why at supper time
[3275.1s] some will forfeit the invitation and
[3278.2s] they will disqualify themselves in

[3522.8s] the third group says we have married
[3525.2s] wives
[3526.2s] they have joined themselves into
[3528.9s] apostate protestantism and they have
[3531.4s] accepted their doctrines they have
[3533.8s] accepted to be one with them you see
[3537.4s] bibliona
[3538.5s] and
[3539.1s] get this very carefully
[3541.7s] is one of the reasons as to why god
[3545.3s] must raise the people to give the loud
[3547.0s] cry of the third angel
[3549.0s] it's one
[3550.4s] of the reasons
[3552.3s] you see

[3586.5s] we are told
[3588.5s] and listen very carefully
[3592.2s] we are told i'm beginning from paragraph
[3594.6s] number one it is satan's plan to weaken
[3596.9s] the faith of god's people in the
[3598.2s] testimonies
[3599.8s] next follows skepticism in regard to the
[3602.0s] vital points of our faith
[3604.1s] the pillars of our positions then
[3605.8s] doubted us to the holy scriptures
[3608.0s] and then the downward march to perdition
[3610.7s] when the testimonies which were once
[3612.6s] believed are doubted
[3614.6s] and given up satan knows the deceived
[3617.8s] ones will not stop at this
[3619.8s] and redoubles its efforts
[3621.9s] till he launches them into an open
[3624.5s] rebellion which becomes incurable and
[3627.7s] ends into destruction
[3629.8s] satan gained marked advantage
[3633.4s] in
[3634.6s] because the people of god have not
[3636.6s] guarded the outposts
[3638.5s] the very men whose labors god has
[3640.5s] signified that he would accept if they
[3642.9s] were fully concentrated have been the
[3645.0s] ones to be deceived
[3646.9s] to fail in their duties and to prove a
[3649.5s] terrible burden and discouragement
[3652.6s] instead of the help and blessing that
[3654.6s] they should have been these men
[3657.7s] who have been trusted to keep the fought
[3660.9s] have well now betrayed it into the hands
[3664.4s] of the enemy that awaited us
[3672.7s] betrayal they have betrayed god into the
[3675.7s] hands of the enemy
[3677.9s] they have opened the gates to a willie
[3680.8s] four enemy who has sought to destroy
[3683.9s] them
[3687.0s] men of experience have seen stealthy
[3689.4s] hands sleeping the balls that satan
[3691.8s] might enter yet they have held their
[3694.4s] peace with apparent indifference as to
[3697.1s] the results some have been glad to see
[3700.2s] this as it seemed an extenuation of
[3703.8s] their past neglect which made it a
[3706.1s] necessity to call for others to fill the
[3708.4s] posts of
[3709.4s] responsibility that they had abused or
[3711.9s] neglected
[3715.9s] they have betrayed
[3718.8s] to the enemy

[3859.8s] okay it is a great deception a
[3862.2s] fanaticism
[3864.3s] a fascinating delusion that takes
[3866.5s] possessions of the mind when men who
[3869.0s] have once known the truth must take the
[3871.0s] form of godliness for the spirit and
[3872.6s] power thereof
[3874.2s] when they suppose that they are rich and
[3876.0s] increased with goods
[3877.5s] and in need of nothing while in reality
[3879.9s] they are in need of everything
[3881.8s] god has not changed toward his faithful
