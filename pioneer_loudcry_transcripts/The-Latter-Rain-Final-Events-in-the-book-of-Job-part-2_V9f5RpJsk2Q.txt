temporal deliverance from the roman yoke and they could not tolerate the thought that he in whom all their hopes centered should suffer an ignominious death the words which they needed to remember were banished from their minds and when the time of trial came it found them unprepared the death of jesus was foolish for has fully destroyed their hopes as if he had not forwarded them so in the prophecies of the future the future is opened before us as plainly as it was opened to the disciples by the words of christ the events connected with the clause of probation and the work of preparation for the time of trouble are clearly presented but multitudes have no more understanding of these important truths than if they had never been revealed satan watches to catch away every impression that would make them wise unto salvation and that's the time of trouble will find them and ready for our adventist events connected with the close of probation and the work of preparation
