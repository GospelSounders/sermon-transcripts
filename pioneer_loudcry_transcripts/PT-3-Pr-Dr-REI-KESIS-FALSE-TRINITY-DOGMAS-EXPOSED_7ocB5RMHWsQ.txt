[148.8s] God Romans
[158.7s] 1 Romans chapter
[161.7s] 1 they are without
[176.0s] excuse for the invisible things of him
[180.2s] referring to God from the creation of
[183.6s] the world are clearly seen being
[186.5s] understood by the things that are
[193.5s] made even eternal power and godhead so
[198.9s] that they are without
[200.8s] excuse the term
[203.6s] godhead the Divinity of God the Divine
[208.7s] being
[220.0s] he is a Divine being his
[224.0s] divinity is clearly sh and his power
[229.4s] godhead
[231.1s] Divinity Divine being divine nature the
[235.7s] divine nature and his
[238.7s] power
[252.4s] unknown God in act
[262.7s] 17:23 verse 29 for as much then as we

[298.6s] Father
[300.4s] there is one
[302.3s] God the Father the Son and the Holy
[305.7s] Spirit are unity of three Eternal
[320.1s] persons that is the difference between
[322.8s] godhead which is Divinity and The
[328.1s] Trinity which is
[330.0s] a Unity of three Eternal persons that
[333.9s] make up one
[337.1s] God Trinity is godhead and godhead is
