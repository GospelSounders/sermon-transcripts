FULL TRANSCRIPT:
friends the world is getting ready Satan is gathering his forces we have been presenting the message of the New World Order according to the scriptures the final agenda of Satan to rule the world through the New World Order final attempt to overthrow the kingdom of God and to set up the mark of the beast the Bible says in Revelation 17: number 12 concerning the New World Order it is written and the 10 horns which thou swest are 10 Kings which have received no Kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with the Beast these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast this shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings the Bible shows the final agenda but Jesus will reign supreme many people do not understand where the world is heading Bible prophecies clear Satan had an agenda in heaven before he was thrown out of Heaven he had five strategic plans which he had suggested and the angels of heaven were deceived a third of them who fell together with him the Bible says in Isaiah chapter number 14 and vers number 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did is weaken the Nations the nations are weakened for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend unto Heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sights of the north I will Ascend above the highs of the clouds and finally he said I I will be like the most high so if the church and the Christians who are true to the Bible and the scriptures and the voice of God will be quiet then the stones will pick it up from there we have done our part the United Nations has set Vision 2030 everyone is watching some are not clear of what is going to happen the nations of the Earth are being taken captives the religious world is silent take a listen to what is happening to the nations of the earth including our own country Kenya I want you to listen to what the stones are saying these may not be necessarily Christians but these are faithful citizens of this country listen to what they saying and then we'll come back fellow Kenyans uh Steve mooa now basically I just wanted to touch on few issues uh um I'm one person who believes that you can never find a solution to any problem you're going through as a country if you don't understand the root cause of these problems now you'll agree with me that uh the entire country is in shambles in terms of people's emotions and uh the feelings you know people feel betrayed people feel uh the cost of living is gone up you know they were promised so much and they're not getting anything and it's it's very important for Kenyans to understand what is really happening in this country uh without doubt and fear of contradiction I'll tell you that the entire Kenyan systems from the political to the economic I'll say even probably the social uh systems have been taken over by the globalists today as we speak the globalists control our entire political system policy systems and the economic systems when I talk of the globalist I'm talking of the IMF I'm talking of the World Bank I'm talking of the world economic forum and we have to understand what these people are and what their intentions are in the long run now I'll take you briefly uh towards the history so that you understand where I'm coming from remember all these people work through serious organizations like the United Nations the United Nations was created immediately after the second world war that was in 1946 in the 13th of February 1946 the United Nations formulated a document called the United Nations Charter in the charter it states clearly that its key objective is to break down the sovereign ities of countries and create a one world government that is very clear and as I've said I'm not here to propagate anything this is information that is out there go to the net go to the web look for the United Nation chter and you'll find this information it states it's it states down everything all the regulations all all all all all all the advantages that the UN will have which is their agenda now during the that time with this big agenda and remember even before the second world war the great leaders for example the likes of uh the likes of Hitler the likes of Stalin they all had the similar objective of controlling the whole world but they failed because with them they resulted to using Force which didn't work now after the formulation of the UN these organizations were were run by a group of cabals or bosses or globalists known as the build thebad Group which later on changed its name in 1971 to the world economic Forum now led by a German Economist called Cloud show up later on during this period the world was experiencing what to call the Cold War so immediately the Cold War ended in 1991 the club of Rome started accelerating this idea of the new world order or the world world uh One World Government remember it is even evident they did a book there's a book called the first Global Revolution if you have time go online look for that book read that book that book States clearly that the biggest enemy of the world is Humanity itself in 1992 more than 166 country countries met under the UN and signed and agreed that the biggest problem the world is experiencing is overpopulation and that they should create and formulate ways on how to depopulate the world and I'm telling you Kenyans this is information that is out there you can go out there research read and get to understand the acceleration started and they formulated a document under the world economic Forum if you read if you go and read about the world economic Forum this is an umbrella of the globalist the rich people of the world they meet in a place called Davos every year in Switzerland and they decide the way forward you know this year we'll invest in this we'll put these laws we'll put this formulate this policies in these countries and so forth create this and create that destabilize this and stabilize that that is they they they they are in quotes the bosses of the world to me I believe you're all equal but that's their mentality which they have a right to believe the what whatever they believe in their strategy of depopulation and control in order to create the One World Government they picked on few issues to tackle number one the basic thing to do to control Mankind and also to depopulate mankind is control the food you control the food you control Humanity so they've been putting in place enforcing leaders whom they control in all these countries to create policies that at the end of the day will frustrate the citizens will create food shortages and will end up creating hunger starvation hence depopulation will be there either in the form of malnutrition or lack of food and these things are coming I'm not joking you want to take it for granted it's up to you since no leader is talking about this since no leader understands what's going on I have taken this mantle to talk to Kenyans so that let us discuss the real issues let us discuss what is ailing this country if we can solve that problem I'm telling you our problem is not money our problem is not economy those are things we can solve we've done it before kibaki did it before without help from anyone we have best brains in this country but we have to understand that our president has been held captive and it did not start with Ruto if you look at all these policies all these policies the implementations started during uru time I was in odm I was an neck member and I'll tell you 101% and any neck member including R oinga himself will confirm I am the only person who left and told them there's a game being played and I guaranteed and even if you go to our walls before they remove me from the group go to the walls of the neck my last message was we will go to elections in the next two years and uru will never take Raa to gay live alone Mount Kenya as much as uru does not like rut he had no option these were conditions given to him and they knew they cannot control R odinga that's why he had to pass the mantle to Ruto let no one lie to you they might have their own personal differences they don't like each other but they they all are were and are controlled by the same system that that one you can take it to the bank now I'll speak of the few things that we've seen in this country that are being formulated after told you the New World Order agenda aims to control the whole world by creating a One World Government when I talk of a One World Government I'm talking of one government one president one Army one Judicial System you know and it trickles down for them to do that they came with a formulation document number one control the food number two identity and that's when they came with the new idea of the digital identity through the help of it so that they can be able to control and know each and every movement of each and every person on Earth these things are real these things are coming now let me let let me touch on let me touch on food how how how how are they going to do it it's through formulation of policies they came up with the agenda of climate change what does climate change has to do with agriculture number one with the climate change formulation policy it says agriculture in itself is what is creating the changes in climate number one they're bringing in restrictions on nitrogen fertilizers number two we have seen in Kenya here even from kinu time when he formulated what we call the strategy document when he was the minister today it is illegal to share seeds so even organic seeds if I'm to give my neighbor for him to plant in his 100 acres it is illegal we created policies to allow foreign companies to come and patent their seeds here which you're not supposed to buy from anyone else apart from them and Mark you majority of these seeds are genetically modified seeds which number one are very expensive to buy Al there you go on Google Kenyans just check the price of tomato seeds GMO tomato seeds the cheapest you'll get is about 10 million Shillings per kilo the best quality is about 50 60 million Shillings a kilo of tomato seeds so what does that mean if you're forcing me to buy these seeds as a normal farmer and I can't afford 10 million what what is the next thing I'll do I'll abandon farming and that's what is happening they brought in laws on on on uh potato Farmers they brought in funny funny laws on farming just to break down the farmers and ensure you're no longer in the industry same as livestock farming what does the climate change policy say on climate far uh livestock farming it says livestock farming releases um greenhouse gases which release nitrogen in the air hence affect the climate so they're saying now you have to register if you have cows if you have cattle if you have poultry and if you don't there are Hefty fines up to millions of shillings to scare you all these things are done by Design because they want to control the food remember I have told you in the world economic Forum in the New World Order agenda they St very well that the idea is no one should own anything the entire land the entire farming should be owned by the corporations so my friend when you're busy talking about this housing project housing project the housing projects is a must for rut to do them because he's been told he must do them simply because in the two next few years there's no farmer who will be able to farm in this country and the next thing they'll do they'll give you offers they'll offer you money for your farm once you hand over your farm they'll give you an offer they'll tell you by the way we have an apartment which you can get at a better price you've heard words even from the president himself where he says I think it is time people should leave rural areas and come to urban areas we need to free up space for farming free up space for farming you know some words like building back better you know building back better go on YouTube just type build back better go on Twitter build back better you'll see the people who mention that word and what they say they're all aligned to this agenda they call them sustainable development goals it's not sustainable my friend all they want is total control I will tell you as a Kenyan as a patriot someone who cannot be bought and it's sad no leader is seeing the angle in which this thing is being uh directed so my friends stop asking about the housing projects and all that all those houses are meant for all those who will lose their land that's why there's no structure that's why even the mes that's why even the the Attorney General comes and says he knew nothing about this housing thing you know because it is above his level it is being done by the cabals and it is through policies MPS please I know how they control you but please before you amend and pass these bills read them read them when you go to the United Nations Charter most of the countries in the world have even signed that they're going to surrender 30% of the land to the UN for the purpose of Conservancy to preserve climate today in Kenya laws are coming you know read laws are coming to give the Government powers for compulsory acquisition of land you know they come to kitui and say now the entire kitu we need to do some Conservancy here so you people have to leave compulsory acquisition and you're offering 10 Shillings per acre or 10 million per acre or 1 million or or or or three you know it's government my friend so these things are there and it's the UN saying it they're giving them the the way forward the the path is being created by them now once you control the food it means hunger will come people will be frustrated you've controlled the food number two control their economy frustrate them economically look at this country for the last 10 years when did you hear when did you last hear of a success story there's a businessman who started a business and is doing well you can't do well because the system have been made to break us completely who formulated the law that you can't withdraw 1 million or or deposit more than 1 million Shillings when Ruto was campaigning he said he will make sure he opens up that LW why has it not changed why is it the one who was in charge of Treasury during uhuru's time and the one who was in charge of of of of Central Bank why is it the same people who we sa and cast them that they've brought down our economy why is it that when Ruto came in they didn't bring in new people they just SWA them to went the other side and Jog went to the other side there only two reasons why you'll do that number one it's either to control information or number two to continue doing what they were doing which we I you and I know is breaking the system number three now once you create all these people die of stress you know many people look at look at the the the mental cases going on in the country look at look at the diseases look look at the pressure people are going through economically people are frustrated people are you know it's like people are going crazy now you cannot even Farm there's no food there's nothing what next now that we we've started dealing with the numbers we now need to control them how do we control them we control them through the digital ID remember very soon this entire economic system the dollar system the world Reserve System is going to collapse there's going to be an introduction of the new cbdc they called the Central Bank digital currencies we are all going digital it's like the Bitcoins you know and the digital currency will be attached to your digital identity so my friend you break the rules like you say things against the government for example what I'm saying you can't use your digital currency anywhere you go to a shop to buy skuma you're told so you understand what I mean you know you can't travel you can't move you're told you can't leave Nairobi out of Nairobi my friend your your digital currency cannot work so you cannot survive so those are the things that are coming and how will they do it it's very simple how do you do it you create chaos how do you create chaos to make people adapt the the digital ID because some countries people will Rebel so what do you do open the borders free Visa open the borders because you know the moment I open the Border all that will come in in an expectation in a year or so chaos will erupt then the government now will come as a Good Samaritan and tell you oh please uh because there's so much crime in this country we now need compulsory acquisition of digital IDs to everyone so that we can know each and everyone and my friends you will get that digital ID and once you get that digital ID you are in jail slavery is coming back and this is real I'm saying it from the bottom of my heart and I'm saying I'm not propagating anything this is is information that is out there go read about the Davos agenda go read about the world economic Forum go read about the New World Order go read about the UN Charter and you'll understand where we are heading to that is what is happening my friends that is what is happening not once not twice not Thrice your president himself he's told even his leaders I watched when they had the the PG at state house he said my hands are tied now he's the senior most civil servant in the country he's the boss who else can tie his hand and he's the boss of all bosses in this country it is the globalists and they've taken over and I think he needs help I think he needs help you know we should not just we should not just uh Ambush him I think that man is suffering and he needs help because it's a point of no return today you've seen yesterday they were in Uganda R is opting out and remember the last one of the last interviews Raa did he said I've realized it's not true to who stole my elections my elections were stolen by some people who have interests now it's me telling you because they're always scared to say they're always scared to mention those names because the few leaders who mentioned you know you know you know the story of our neighboring presidents who died finally you know you go yeah we know them you know them you go against them they they deal with you anyway people like us personally I'm not scared of anything the worst thing in life is there's there's one old man who told me the richest place on Earth is the grave because beneath the grave lies so many ideas lies so many eye openers that did not utilize the time when they were alive so I decide to use this time just to talk to to my fellow Kenyans the worst thing is when our kids will grow up and find such we live a beautiful country like this where our forefathers died poured blood for us to have this slavery this beautiful country and we leaving it to the dogs you know it's it's so sad you know when our kids will be asking us daddy mommy where were you when all this was happening we have to start speaking now the media focus on the right issues the media don't be scared what we are saying is let us talk about the fundamental let's Cascade down to the roots and know the real causes of our problems and that's when we'll find a solution the few leaders who've been there and been been trying I want to to to to appla one ok omata but you seem not to to recognize him you know because he's a nobody we are meant to believe that in opposition it is so and so he supposed to talk and so and so he supposed to talk my friend hey every Kenyan has something to say even a beggar on the road can save your life information is power and knowledge is king So Kenyans I urge you and the media from today start researching start reading about all these agenda the New World Order agenda the agenda 2030 the world economic Forum read about the UN Charter read about the globalist agenda and you'll understand what is happening in Kenya it's the same thing that has been happening all over today for the whole of last two weeks you've seen farmers in Germany in Spain in Holland they were all demonstrating why were they demonstrating because of similar policies land is being taken from them now it's being owned by the globalists they said policies where they snatch the land from them and that is what is coming in this country it is coming so are you ready the question is are you ready anyway if there's any leader any person who disputes what I'm saying I'm ready call me for an interview anywhere CNN BBC Al jaaz K call me one onone two on two even the president himself I'm ready to sit with you challenge me I challenge you I'm doing this for Kenya Kenya is my business and my business is Kenya thank you Kenyans Kaz

[43.4s] Beast these have one mind and shall give
[46.6s] their power and strength unto the
[50.7s] Beast this shall make war with the lamb
[53.4s] and the lamb shall overcome them for he
[55.4s] is Lord of lords and King of Kings the
[58.0s] Bible shows the final agenda
[61.0s] but Jesus will reign
[63.9s] supreme many people do not understand
[66.8s] where the world is heading Bible
[68.5s] prophecies clear Satan had an agenda in
[71.3s] heaven before he was thrown out of
[75.2s] Heaven he had five strategic
[78.3s] plans which he had suggested and the
[81.1s] angels of heaven were deceived a third
[83.2s] of them who fell together with him the
[87.4s] Bible says in Isaiah chapter number 14
[89.7s] and vers number 12 how art thou fallen
[93.1s] from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the
[95.0s] morning how art thou cut down to the
[97.7s] ground which did is weaken the Nations

[117.5s] clouds and finally he said I I will be
[121.1s] like the most
[122.8s] high
[124.4s] so if the church and the Christians who
[127.6s] are true to the Bible and the scriptures
[129.8s] and the voice of God will be quiet then
[132.9s] the stones will pick it up from there we
[135.7s] have done our part the United Nations
[138.6s] has set Vision 2030 everyone is watching
[142.7s] some are not clear of what is going to
[145.0s] happen the nations of the Earth are
[146.7s] being taken captives the religious world
[149.2s] is silent
[150.7s] take a listen to what is happening to
[152.5s] the nations of the earth including our
[154.7s] own country Kenya I want you to listen
[157.1s] to what the stones are saying these may
[159.3s] not be necessarily Christians but these
[161.7s] are faithful citizens of this country
[164.2s] listen to what they saying and then
[166.2s] we'll come
[169.5s] back fellow
[172.6s] Kenyans uh Steve
[175.9s] mooa now basically I just wanted to
[178.2s] touch on few issues uh um I'm one person
[181.7s] who believes
[183.1s] that you can never find a solution to
[186.2s] any problem you're going through as a
[187.7s] country if you don't
[190.2s] understand the root cause of these
[193.0s] problems now you'll agree with me that
[196.0s] uh the entire
[199.4s] country is in shambles in terms of
[203.2s] people's emotions and uh the feelings
[206.6s] you know people feel betrayed people
[208.6s] feel uh the cost of living is gone up
[212.0s] you know they were promised so much and
[213.6s] they're not getting anything and it's
[216.3s] it's very important for Kenyans to
[218.4s] understand what is really happening in
[219.8s] this
[220.8s] country uh without doubt and fear of
[224.4s] contradiction I'll tell you that the
[226.5s] entire Kenyan systems from the political
[229.4s] to the economic I'll say even probably
[231.9s] the
[232.7s] social uh systems have been taken over
[236.1s] by the globalists today as we speak
[240.2s] the globalists control our entire
[242.6s] political system policy systems and the
[245.9s] economic systems when I talk of the
[247.8s] globalist I'm talking of the IMF I'm
[249.4s] talking of the World Bank I'm talking of
[250.8s] the world economic forum and we have to
[253.9s] understand what these people are and
[257.5s] what their intentions are in the long
[259.9s] run now I'll take you
[263.2s] briefly uh towards the history so that
[266.3s] you understand where I'm coming from
[269.0s] remember
[270.4s] all these people work through serious
[273.2s] organizations like the United Nations
[275.9s] the United Nations was created
[280.4s] immediately after the second world war
[282.2s] that was in 1946 in the 13th of February
[285.8s] 1946 the United Nations formulated a
[289.7s] document called the United Nations
[291.6s] Charter in the charter it states clearly
[294.8s] that its key
[296.5s] objective is to break down the sovereign
[299.7s] ities of countries and create a one
[302.6s] world government that is very clear and
[305.3s] as I've said I'm not here to propagate
[307.1s] anything this is information that is out
[309.7s] there go to the net go to the web look
[312.7s] for the United Nation chter and you'll
[314.9s] find this information it states it's it
[318.1s] states down everything all the
[320.2s] regulations all all all all all all the
[324.2s] advantages that the UN will have which
[326.9s] is their agenda now during the that time
[331.1s] with this big agenda and remember even
[333.4s] before the second world war the great
[335.1s] leaders for example the likes of uh the
[339.2s] likes of Hitler the likes of Stalin they
[342.5s] all had the similar objective of
[345.9s] controlling the whole world but they
[347.8s] failed because with them they resulted
[350.7s] to using Force which didn't
[353.2s] work now after the formulation of the
[356.4s] UN these
[358.4s] organizations were were run by a group
[361.0s] of cabals or bosses or globalists known
[365.7s] as the build thebad Group which later on
[369.1s] changed its name in 1971 to the world
[372.5s] economic Forum now led by a German
[374.8s] Economist called Cloud show
[377.8s] up later on during this period the world
[382.0s] was experiencing what to call the Cold
[383.6s] War so immediately the Cold War ended in
[387.8s] 1991 the club of Rome
[390.8s] started
[392.9s] accelerating this idea of the new world
[395.4s] order or the world world uh One World
[399.0s] Government remember it is even evident
[402.7s] they did a book there's a book called
[405.4s] the
[406.7s] first Global Revolution if you have time
[410.8s] go online look for that book read that
[412.7s] book that book States clearly that the
[414.6s] biggest enemy of the world is Humanity
[418.3s] itself in 1992 more than 166 country
[423.0s] countries met under the UN and signed
[426.8s] and agreed that the biggest problem the
[428.8s] world is experiencing is overpopulation
[431.6s] and that they should create and
[433.8s] formulate ways on how to depopulate the
[438.6s] world and I'm telling you Kenyans this
[441.0s] is information that is out there you can
[442.6s] go out there research read and get to
[448.3s] understand the acceleration started and
[452.0s] they formulated a document under the
[454.8s] world economic Forum if you read if you
[456.8s] go and read about the world economic
[458.3s] Forum this is an umbrella of the
[459.6s] globalist the rich people of the world
[461.5s] they meet in a place called Davos every
[463.4s] year in Switzerland and they decide the
[466.5s] way forward you know this year we'll
[468.6s] invest in this we'll put these laws
[470.5s] we'll put this formulate this policies
[472.6s] in these countries and so forth create
[474.9s] this and create that destabilize this
[476.5s] and stabilize that that is they they
[480.0s] they they are in quotes the bosses of
[482.7s] the world to me I believe you're all
[484.4s] equal but that's their mentality which
[487.0s] they have a right to believe the what
[488.6s] whatever they
[490.8s] believe in their strategy of
[494.5s] depopulation and
[498.0s] control in order to create the One World
[501.7s] Government they picked on few issues to
[505.6s] tackle number one the basic thing to do
[508.8s] to control Mankind and also to
[511.9s] depopulate mankind is control the food
[514.4s] you control the food you
[516.6s] control
[518.8s] Humanity so they've been putting in
[522.4s] place enforcing leaders whom they
[525.6s] control in all these
[527.3s] countries to create policies that at the
[530.6s] end of the
[532.7s] day will frustrate the citizens will
[535.9s] create food shortages and will end up
[539.6s] creating hunger starvation hence
[542.6s] depopulation will be there either in the
[545.0s] form of malnutrition or lack of food and
[547.6s] these things are coming I'm not joking
[549.4s] you want to take it for granted it's up
[550.9s] to you since no leader is talking about
[553.1s] this since no leader understands what's
[555.6s] going on I have taken this mantle to
[557.7s] talk to Kenyans so that let us discuss
[560.0s] the real issues let us discuss what is
[562.2s] ailing this country if we can solve that
[565.0s] problem I'm telling you our problem is
[566.6s] not money our problem is not economy
[569.4s] those are things we can solve we've done
[571.6s] it before kibaki did it
[573.8s] before without help from anyone we have
[577.2s] best brains in this country but we have
[579.8s] to understand that our president has
[581.5s] been held captive and it did not start
[584.4s] with
[585.5s] Ruto if you look at all these
[589.1s] policies all these policies the
[591.5s] implementations started during uru
[595.6s] time I was in odm I was an neck member
[598.8s] and I'll tell you
[600.5s] 101% and any neck member including R
[603.6s] oinga himself will
[605.1s] confirm I am the only person who left
[608.5s] and told them there's a game being
[610.9s] played and I guaranteed and even if you
[613.8s] go to our walls before they remove me
[615.6s] from the group go to the walls of the
[617.6s] neck my last message was we will go to
[620.9s] elections in the next two years and uru
[623.1s] will never take Raa to gay live alone
[626.1s] Mount Kenya as much as uru does not like
[629.0s] rut he had no option these were
[632.0s] conditions given to him and they knew
[634.4s] they cannot control R odinga that's why
[637.4s] he had to pass the mantle to Ruto let no
[640.0s] one lie to you they might have their own
[641.9s] personal differences they don't like
[643.6s] each other but they they
[647.4s] all are were and are controlled by the
[650.8s] same system that that one you can take
[653.1s] it to the bank now I'll speak of the few
[655.6s] things that we've seen in this country
[657.4s] that are being formulated after told you
[660.9s] the New World Order agenda aims to
[664.6s] control the whole world by creating a
[667.8s] One World Government when I talk of a
[669.4s] One World Government I'm talking of one
[671.5s] government one president one Army one
[674.4s] Judicial System you know and it trickles
[679.4s] down for them to do that they came with
[682.2s] a formulation document number one
[683.9s] control the food number
[687.1s] two identity
[689.9s] and that's when they came with the new
[691.9s] idea of the digital identity through the
[694.2s] help of it so that they can be able to
[697.1s] control and know each and every movement
[700.4s] of each and every person on Earth these
[703.4s] things are real these things are coming
[705.6s] now let me let let me touch on let me
[707.9s] touch on
[709.5s] food how how how how are they going to
[712.1s] do it it's through formulation of
[714.4s] policies they came up with the agenda of
[716.7s] climate change what does climate change
[720.2s] has to do with agriculture number one
[722.8s] with the climate change formulation
[724.7s] policy it says agriculture in itself is
[728.5s] what is creating the changes in
[731.7s] climate number one they're bringing in
[734.8s] restrictions on nitrogen fertilizers
[737.7s] number two we have seen in Kenya
[741.4s] here even from kinu time when he
[744.4s] formulated what we call the strategy
[746.1s] document when he was the minister today
[749.4s] it is illegal to share seeds so even
[752.3s] organic seeds if I'm to give my neighbor
[754.2s] for him to plant in his 100 acres it is
[756.3s] illegal we created policies to allow
[759.4s] foreign companies to come and patent
[761.3s] their seeds here which you're not
[763.7s] supposed to buy from anyone else apart
[765.5s] from them and Mark you majority of these
[768.3s] seeds are genetically modified seeds
[770.9s] which number one are very expensive to
[773.1s] buy Al there you go on Google Kenyans
[776.5s] just check the price of tomato seeds GMO
[780.1s] tomato seeds the cheapest you'll get is
[782.2s] about 10 million Shillings per
[784.9s] kilo the best quality is about 50 60
[787.6s] million Shillings a kilo of tomato seeds
[789.9s] so what does that mean if you're forcing
[791.9s] me to buy these seeds as a normal farmer
[794.3s] and I can't afford 10 million what what
[796.5s] is the next thing I'll do I'll abandon
[798.3s] farming and that's what is happening
[800.4s] they brought in laws on on on uh potato
[803.7s] Farmers they brought in funny funny laws
[807.0s] on farming just to break down the
[809.9s] farmers and ensure you're no longer in
[812.1s] the industry same as livestock farming
[814.3s] what does the climate change policy say
[815.8s] on climate far uh livestock farming it
[818.0s] says livestock farming
[820.2s] releases um greenhouse gases which
[824.5s] release nitrogen in the air hence affect
[827.4s] the climate so they're saying now you
[829.9s] have to register if you have cows if you
[831.6s] have cattle if you have poultry and if
[833.6s] you don't there are Hefty fines up to
[835.4s] millions of shillings to scare you all
[838.2s] these things are done by Design because
[840.2s] they want to control the food remember I
[842.2s] have told you in the world economic
[844.3s] Forum in the New World Order agenda they
[846.9s] St very well that the idea is no one
[850.9s] should own anything the entire land the
[854.0s] entire farming should be owned by the
[857.7s] corporations so my friend when you're
[860.6s] busy talking about this housing project
[862.2s] housing project the housing projects is
[866.0s] a must for rut to do them because he's
[867.9s] been told he must do them simply because
[871.0s] in the two next few years there's no
[873.4s] farmer who will be able to farm in this
[874.9s] country and the next thing they'll do
[877.0s] they'll give you offers they'll offer
[878.4s] you money for your farm once you hand
[881.2s] over your
[882.3s] farm they'll give you an offer they'll
[884.3s] tell you by the way we have an apartment
[886.2s] which you can get at a better price
[888.1s] you've heard words even from the
[890.0s] president himself where he says I think
[891.9s] it is time people should leave rural
[893.4s] areas and come to urban areas we need to
[895.5s] free up space for farming free up space
[897.7s] for farming you know some words like
[899.7s] building back better you know building
[901.7s] back better go on YouTube just type
[904.2s] build back better go on Twitter build
[906.6s] back better you'll see the people who
[908.2s] mention that word and what they say
[910.2s] they're all aligned to this agenda they
[912.7s] call them sustainable development goals
[914.9s] it's not sustainable my friend all they
[916.6s] want is total control I will tell you as
[918.9s] a Kenyan as a patriot someone who cannot
[920.6s] be bought and it's sad no leader is
[923.3s] seeing the angle in which this thing is
[926.0s] being uh directed so my friends stop
[929.6s] asking about the housing projects and
[931.5s] all that all those houses are meant for
[933.0s] all those who will lose their land
[934.7s] that's why there's no structure that's
[936.3s] why even the mes that's why even the the
[938.6s] Attorney General comes and says he knew
[940.5s] nothing about this housing thing you
[942.3s] know because it is above his level it is
[945.2s] being done by the cabals and it is
[947.9s] through policies MPS please I know how
[951.4s] they control you but please before you
[953.8s] amend and pass these bills read them
[957.2s] read them when you go to the United
[959.9s] Nations
[961.0s] Charter most of the countries in the
[963.0s] world have even signed that they're
[965.5s] going to surrender 30% of the
[969.1s] land to the UN for the purpose of
[971.6s] Conservancy to preserve
[974.8s] climate today in Kenya laws are coming
[978.9s] you know read laws are coming to give
[981.9s] the Government powers for compulsory
[984.1s] acquisition of land you know they come
[986.4s] to kitui and say now the entire kitu we
[989.2s] need to do some Conservancy here so you
[992.8s] people have to leave compulsory
[994.8s] acquisition and you're offering 10
[996.6s] Shillings per acre or 10 million per
[998.6s] acre or 1 million or or or or three you
[1001.9s] know it's government my friend so these
[1004.2s] things are there and it's the UN saying
[1005.8s] it they're giving them the the way
[1008.2s] forward the the path is being created by
[1012.2s] them
[1013.8s] now once you control the food it means
[1018.2s] hunger will come
[1019.4s] people will be frustrated you've
[1021.0s] controlled the food number two control
[1024.2s] their economy frustrate them
[1026.2s] economically look at this country for
[1028.2s] the last 10 years when did you hear when
[1031.2s] did you last hear of a success story
[1033.1s] there's a businessman who started a
[1034.4s] business and is doing well you can't do
[1037.2s] well because the system have been made
[1040.0s] to break us
[1043.6s] completely who formulated the law that
[1046.2s] you can't withdraw 1 million or or
[1048.3s] deposit more than 1 million
[1050.6s] Shillings when Ruto was campaigning he
[1053.5s] said he will make sure he opens up that
[1055.5s] LW why has it not
[1057.1s] changed why is
[1059.5s] it the one who was in charge of Treasury
[1062.5s] during uhuru's time and the one who was
[1065.1s] in charge of of of of Central
[1068.5s] Bank why is it the same people who we sa
[1072.4s] and cast them that they've brought down
[1074.5s] our economy why is it that when Ruto
[1076.8s] came in they didn't bring in new people
[1078.6s] they just SWA them to went the other
[1080.6s] side and Jog went to the other side
[1083.1s] there only two reasons why you'll do
[1084.7s] that number one it's either to control
[1087.2s] information or number two to continue
[1089.6s] doing what they were doing which we I
[1092.2s] you and I know is breaking the
[1096.8s] system number
[1098.7s] three now once you create all these
[1101.7s] people die of stress you know many
[1103.4s] people look at look at the the the
[1105.2s] mental cases going on in the country
[1107.2s] look at look at the diseases look look
[1108.9s] at the pressure people are going through
[1110.8s] economically people are frustrated
[1112.5s] people are you know it's like people are
[1114.2s] going crazy now you cannot even Farm
[1116.4s] there's no food there's nothing what
[1120.2s] next now that we we've started dealing
[1123.0s] with the numbers we now need to control
[1125.0s] them how do we control them we control
[1126.9s] them through the digital ID remember
[1129.9s] very soon this entire economic system
[1132.9s] the dollar system the world Reserve
[1134.5s] System is going to collapse there's
[1136.6s] going to be an introduction of the new
[1138.2s] cbdc they called the Central Bank
[1140.1s] digital currencies we are all going
[1142.2s] digital it's like the Bitcoins you know
[1144.8s] and the digital currency will be
[1147.4s] attached to your digital identity so my
[1151.3s] friend you break the rules like you say
[1154.9s] things against the government for
[1156.0s] example what I'm saying you can't use
[1158.9s] your digital currency anywhere you go to
[1160.7s] a shop to buy skuma you're
[1164.0s] told so you understand what I mean you
[1167.0s] know you can't travel you can't move
[1169.0s] you're told you can't leave Nairobi out
[1170.8s] of Nairobi my friend your your digital
[1173.6s] currency cannot work so you cannot
[1175.4s] survive so those are the things that are
[1177.6s] coming and how will they do it it's very
[1179.9s] simple how do you do it you create chaos
[1183.2s] how do you create chaos to make people
[1185.9s] adapt the the digital ID because some
[1189.2s] countries people will Rebel so what do
[1191.2s] you do open the borders free
[1194.3s] Visa open the borders because you know
[1196.8s] the moment I open the Border all that
[1199.2s] will come
[1200.8s] in in an expectation in a year or so
[1204.2s] chaos will erupt then the government now
[1207.2s] will come as a Good Samaritan and tell
[1208.8s] you oh please uh because there's so much
[1211.5s] crime in this country we now need
[1214.7s] compulsory acquisition of digital IDs to
[1218.1s] everyone so that we can know each and
[1220.4s] everyone and my friends you will get
[1222.4s] that digital ID and once you get that
[1224.3s] digital ID you are in jail slavery is
[1227.3s] coming back and this is real I'm saying
[1229.4s] it from the bottom of my heart and I'm
[1230.6s] saying I'm not propagating anything this
[1232.7s] is is information that is out there go
[1235.0s] read about the Davos agenda go read
[1237.0s] about the world economic Forum go read
[1238.9s] about the New World Order go read about
[1240.8s] the UN Charter and you'll understand
[1242.6s] where we are heading
[1245.9s] to that is what is happening my
[1249.0s] friends that is what is
[1252.0s] happening not once not twice not Thrice
[1254.7s] your president himself he's told even
[1256.6s] his leaders I watched when they had the
[1258.6s] the PG at state house he said my hands
[1261.8s] are
[1262.6s] tied now he's the senior most civil
[1265.2s] servant in the country he's the boss who
[1267.8s] else can tie his
[1270.4s] hand and he's the boss of all bosses in
[1273.4s] this country it is the globalists and
[1276.2s] they've taken over and I think he needs
[1278.9s] help I think he needs help you know we
[1281.8s] should not just we should not just uh
[1284.8s] Ambush him I think that man is suffering
[1287.7s] and he needs help
[1289.5s] because it's a point of no return today
[1291.7s] you've seen yesterday they were in
[1293.3s] Uganda R is opting out and remember the
[1298.1s] last one of the last interviews Raa did
[1300.2s] he said I've realized it's not true to
[1302.0s] who stole my elections my elections were
[1304.1s] stolen by some people who have interests
[1305.9s] now it's me telling you because they're
[1307.4s] always scared to say they're always
[1310.0s] scared to mention those names because
[1311.9s] the few leaders who mentioned you know
[1313.7s] you know you know the story of our
[1315.3s] neighboring presidents who died finally
[1317.6s] you know you go yeah we know them you
[1319.4s] know them you go against them they they
[1321.8s] deal with you
[1324.2s] anyway people like us personally I'm not
[1326.6s] scared of anything the worst thing in
[1329.1s] life is there's there's one old man who
[1331.5s] told me the richest place on Earth is
[1333.6s] the grave because beneath the grave lies
[1336.8s] so many ideas lies so many eye openers
[1340.0s] that did not utilize the time when they
[1343.3s] were
[1344.2s] alive so I decide to use this time just
[1348.1s] to talk to to my fellow Kenyans the
[1350.2s] worst thing is when our kids will grow
[1352.8s] up and find such we live a beautiful
[1356.9s] country like this where our forefathers
[1358.7s] died poured blood for us to have this
[1361.1s] slavery this beautiful country and we
[1363.4s] leaving it to the dogs you know it's
[1365.2s] it's so sad you know when our kids will
[1366.9s] be asking us daddy mommy where were you
[1368.8s] when all this was happening we have to
[1370.6s] start speaking now the media focus on
[1373.1s] the right issues the media don't be
[1375.9s] scared what we are saying is let us talk
[1380.0s] about the fundamental let's Cascade down
[1382.2s] to the roots and know the real causes of
[1385.3s] our problems and that's when we'll find
[1387.6s] a
[1390.0s] solution the few leaders who've been
[1392.2s] there and been been trying I want to to
[1394.9s] to to appla one ok
[1397.1s] omata but you seem not to to recognize
[1400.2s] him you know because he's a nobody we
[1401.8s] are meant to believe that in opposition
[1403.7s] it is so and so he supposed to talk and
[1405.8s] so and so he supposed to talk my friend
[1408.3s] hey every Kenyan has something to say
[1410.4s] even a beggar on the road can save your
[1412.9s] life information is power and knowledge
[1415.3s] is
[1416.0s] king So Kenyans I urge you and the media
[1420.0s] from today start researching start
[1423.2s] reading about all these agenda the New
[1425.4s] World Order agenda the agenda 2030 the
[1428.0s] world economic Forum read about the UN
[1430.4s] Charter read about the globalist agenda
[1434.4s] and you'll understand what is happening
[1436.0s] in Kenya it's the same thing that has
[1437.8s] been happening
[1439.0s] all over today for the whole of last two
[1441.8s] weeks you've seen farmers in Germany in
[1444.0s] Spain in Holland they were all
[1446.2s] demonstrating why were they
[1447.6s] demonstrating because of similar
[1449.6s] policies land is being taken from them
[1452.0s] now it's being owned by the globalists
[1453.9s] they said policies where they snatch the
[1455.6s] land from them and that is what is
[1457.2s] coming in this country it is coming so
