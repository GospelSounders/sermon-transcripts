TIMESTAMPED TRANSCRIPT:
[1.6s] good uh evening friends let us listen to
[5.0s] The General Conference president as he
[7.6s] tries to explain about God the mystical
[14.0s] understandings
[25.1s] conference it is a deception of the
[27.8s] highest order and I want to
[37.0s] listen God of Babylon trying to explain
[40.6s] a
[41.4s] mystery which the Roman papacy claims to
[44.2s] be a
[45.2s] mystery I want us to listen very
[53.2s] carefully is an interesting substance it
[56.8s] can Cascade down thundering waterfall
[59.9s] Falls filling lakes and rivers that flow
[63.5s] into the Mighty Sea it can be frozen
[65.8s] solid turning into ice that covers the
[68.8s] poles of the earth and it can rise as a
[72.8s] vapor icy cold or steaming hot three
[77.6s] forms liquid solid and vapor and yet all
[82.7s] are one substance
[85.4s] water perhaps God is a bit like that we
[90.4s] can't specifically indicate everything
[93.8s] about God absolutely sure but perhaps
[97.9s] he's a bit like this one God yet three
[100.8s] distinct persons with unique
[104.2s] characteristics and roles all working
[107.8s] together to save as many as possible for
[112.7s] eternity after listening to the
[114.8s] president of the General Conference
[118.8s] SDA
[121.2s] what does the spirit of Prophecy say the
[124.5s] mystical understandings trying to
[127.1s] explain
[128.3s] God of the Trinity to
[132.3s] adventism we are told in manuscripts and
[135.8s] letters series number
[138.0s] 21 of 1906 paragraph
[141.4s] 9 Ellen White said I am instructed to
[144.8s] say the sentiments of those who are
[148.0s] searching for advanced science ien ific
[150.5s] ideas are not to be
[153.0s] trusted such representations as the
[155.8s] following are made the father is as the
[158.6s] light invisible the son is as the light
[161.8s] embodied the spirit as the light shed
[164.9s] abroad the father is like the de
[168.3s] invisible ma Vapor the son is like the
[172.4s] de
[178.8s] gathered form the spirit is like the de
[181.9s] Fallen to the seat of Life another
[185.4s] representation the father is like the
[187.4s] invisible
[189.0s] Vapor the sun is like the laden Cloud
[192.8s] the spirit is rainf fallen and working
[195.2s] in refreshing power all these
[198.2s] spiritualistic
[199.9s] representations are simply
[203.3s] nothingness they are imperfect and true
[206.8s] they weaken and diminish the Majesty
[209.8s] which no earthly likeness can be
[211.4s] compared to God cannot be compared with
[214.7s] the things his hand have made these are
[219.0s] mere Earthly things suffering Under The
[221.6s] Curse Of God because of the sins of man
[224.8s] the father cannot be described by the
[227.6s] things of Earth the father is all the
[230.3s] fullness of the godhead bodily and is
[233.0s] invisible to Mortal sight General
[236.3s] Conference
[238.7s] president
[265.6s] spiritualism general conference is in
[268.6s] apostasy
[283.6s] this is the greatest
[286.8s] apostasy blowing the trumpets and
[290.0s] letting the people know that the new
[292.3s] organization general conference is in
[294.9s] apostasy it is not the Church of God
[298.7s] because they have removed God and Ellen
[302.2s] White said in selected messages book two
[305.1s] page 204 paragraph 2 that they will
[308.6s] remove God God will be removed a new
[312.0s] organization will be
[313.9s] established our religion would be
[316.8s] changed and then she says but God being
[320.4s] removed they will place their dependence
[323.0s] upon human power which without God is
[326.0s] worthless so they have removed God they
[328.8s] have brought the God of Babylon letter
[331.7s] and now they try to explain the Trinity
[333.7s] God of Babylon to us using nature which
[336.8s] is contrary to the spirit of Prophecy
[340.0s] that is a new God in adventism and we
[343.6s] say strongly
[355.2s] to
[357.1s] amen
