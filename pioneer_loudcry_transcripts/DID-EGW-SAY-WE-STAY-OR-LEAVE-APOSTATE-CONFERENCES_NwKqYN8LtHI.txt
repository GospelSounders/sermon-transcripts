FULL TRANSCRIPT:
good afternoon or let's saw Neil at this time a father in Heaven we're grateful for the blessings you have bestowed upon us today We Gather here this afternoon to dig deep into your words to bring clarity to the controversies all around us blessed us for these few moments grant us Heavenly I Salve that we may discern truth that we may also identify error under any guise bless us now we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen I want to turn your attention to Luke Chapter 12. let's turn there Luke chapter 12. how many of you are anxious for tomorrow's service beginning of this final seven days on Earth experience seven Sanctuary feasts are you ready for it friends I'm ready by God's grace now this evening as we spend a few moments addressing these controversies I'm going to ask you kindly to get a writing instrument notepads and the questions that come to your mind as we go throughout this by God's grace at the end I will accommodate those questions I'm going to get my iPad by God's grace and those of you online can also tune in and send in your questions let's turn quickly to Luke chapter 12 and today we're going to continue from where we left off on this morning I was blessed this morning how about you were those points clear as we looked at the sanctuary you see friends everything that we profess to believe as Seventh-day Adventist we believe we can prove those truths from the Bible from the sanctuary am I right yes so what about the logo the actual brand of this church should we be able to prove that also from the sanctuary yes and that's why we are addressing this all-important subject that's not what God plays on his Tabernacle is that what he put dear friends some individuals have taken this logo and actually stated that apparent cross is actually inverted and inverted crosses are connected to witchcraft just follow the top end of that so-called cross when God speaks does he speak plainly and the churches with this and these logos on them if those Tabernacles were in the time of Moses and God inspired a sinner to bring his lamb what Christ have led that sinner to these Tabernacles why wrong address wrong address wrong symbol wrong address they call these three lines Three Angels they call that cherubims that is a disgrace to God there it is friends ecumenical ecumenical straight from Babylon now what if here at safe to serve one day you walked into the church and I had two logos in the front two logos in the center two logos on the walls The Three Angels on one side and the flickering Flame over a so-called book and a cross on the other side what would you think what would you think talk to me what what would come to your mind but I said you do not know what would have come to my mind you don't want to hear it what what would come to your mind if I lost my mind am I insane have I stepped off the platform what else am I confused do you know you have churches out there that claim to believe in present truth claim to be preaching the sermons and the messages for the hour and they have two logos why why would they have two logos The Three Angels on one side or maybe on a website that they oversee but at the actual church building they have that the flickering Flame from Babylon why would they do that what now double-minded want to please everybody that's called compromise one is of god Bible one is of Babylon of Satan that's compromise what would Elijah say if God be God serve him but if bail serve him how long hold you between two opinions not six friends that's called compromise that's called hypocrisy why because if you connect yourself with this organization they want to make sure you have that logo no there's several things I want to say here how many of you remember those days you went to some Churches especially if you are second third fourth generation SDA do you remember uh pardon me not that uh do you remember this logo here or even a rendition of it on the buildings the glass thin windows uh maybe I I took it out that the true logo right there in the center the true logo on the glass stand windows some Churches still had the logo there do you know why they have they have not gotten around to it yet to remodel it but soon they will and others may still have the logo but the message has changed the experience has changed am I right or wrong you know I'm speaking the truth as God lives and as you think about it as they have removed the logo they've also removed the message let's take a look at the first angel what says that first cherubim of chapter 14 of the Revelation verse 7 fear God right say it with me fear God give glory to him why the our office judgment is calm and worship him who made Heaven Earth sea and The Fountains of waters what's number one fear God what does it mean to fear God fear God fear God Victor overseen to despise and hate evil Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 13 the fear of the Lord is to hate evil Pride arrogancy how do we know they have changed the message are they not preaching we will never get victory over sin we'll be sinning until Christ comes what does that mean not only has the logo change but what the message has changed then comes give Glory what does that mean to give Glory Health reform dress reform tempering they are thrown out Health reform just reform Temperance what about judgment they've rejected October 22nd 1844. what about worship God on the seventh day Sabbath have you not heard do you not remember the actual cry that we want to hold Sabbath surfaces on Sunday mornings for those who have to work on Sabbath and cannot come to church on God's Sabbath day Sabbath you can come on Sunday mornings and our church why the logo has changed the merchandise has also changed that's it it would it would be weird as I said bizarre as I said this morning you walk into a Bed Bath and Beyond store and you see no what do they sell inside there so clothing they sell soap okay bath soap right okay and what else Etc you walk inside there and what are they selling watermelon cantaloupe come on now it's it's it's it's it's fall season okay broccoli collards right you would say where am I the sign is correct but the merchandise is incorrect or they don't have the sign and don't have the message Luke chapter 12 go to verse 1. it says be weary after laughing of whom the Pharisees which is what friends hypocrisy hypocrisy and that's why this morning I spent time on this this is God's true sign past that won't spend time on this okay everybody read the red words with me I was told that men will employ every policy to make less prominent the difference between the faith our Seventh-Day Adventists and those who observe the first day of the week past that all right friends okay now notice again they will say we must remove the banner or sign the banner or sign and what sign that God put on his building what sign is on new Jerusalem's Tabernacle the Angels at the gates on the Tabernacle gate and Tabernacle past that won't spend time on that okay I saw some reaching out their hands to remove the banner and to obscure fix that and to obscure its significance I don't want to keep you here too long all right let's move on from this we cannot know and what they want to say friends those who are standing faithful to God in observing the true message and the true logo that they are the ones who have started a new organization now I I wish I had something here on what side of the four corners or four sides of the sanctuary it was the good place on what side East Side so they traveled from where East to where West so what what direction did the Angels cherubims fly east to west from the gate to where the door of the Tabernacle holy Place inner Veil and then most holy is traveling we're east to west and that's why by God's grace we turn our logo with the angels with trumpets not going right to left but what not going left to right but what right to left East to West so when someone sees safe to serve's logo they'll ask a question why are your angels flying right to left what will you say let's go to the sanctuary these cherubims fly how right to left East to West will you say Amen friends we have to make sure we come as close to scripture as possible it's a sign what if someone says come meet me here and remove you remember we were going to evangelize and evangelist John Ryan sent me this uh the direction and instead of putting let's say other member of the address instead of putting uh John's Road he put John's Avenue well here we have John 1 and John's Avenue I'm looking for John's Avenue when it should be John's Road but John is correct but what's incorrect Avenue or road is it important now which direction you're flying or brothers and sisters is it important all right let's move on from that there it is friends you know what let's turn the first Timothy chapter three go there with me and First Timothy chapter three and verse number 16 God's word says uh without controversy great is the mystery of godliness greatest watch Friends the mystery of godliness and there is a controversy going on right now and that controversy is stay in the SDA churches versus come out of apostasy is that clear friends and those who give the latter cry come out of apostasy those in the former group who say you're calling people out of the SDA Church that's what they say that's hypocrisy that's not correct they are creating what we call a straw man because Andrew Enriquez yours truly have never said come out of SDA churches you have ordered me what have I always say come out of what a past State local SDA churches as well as come out of a prostate non-conference churches it goes both ways but when they preach and teach they're calling you to church organization volume 4 page two go to Isaiah chapter one where are you going to my friends Isaiah chapter one what makes our Seventh-day Adventist one more time red words notice how sister white quoted in the blue words the Three Angels messages of course she mentioned first and second that's present truth then she said a red word those who pass through these experiences are to be as firm as a rock to the principles that have made us what everybody Seventh Day Adventist volume what's that volume nine testimonies for the church volume 9 page 48 says let ministers and people bear in mind there may affect that their names are registered on the church's books will not save them oh but I thought if your name is not on a local conference SDA Church you're not going to be saved that was volume nine what page I gave you page 48 pass this won't spend time on that I covered that this morning we cannot now enter into any new Organization for this would mean a pass to see from the word everybody apostasy from the truth now watch this watch Carefree that is the the direction foreign come to me which which slideshow is this it looks weird it looks strange preacher let's see now does this day evening that was from you evangelist Ryan all right let's go to John chapter 15 why do you get that straight preacher preacher that's what I was looking for which direction are the Angels flying we're going to talk afterwards amen preacher come now let's reason and now I use the rod and the staff to comfort you amen they're flying away right to left East to West that's it yeah amen I'm like what's going on here amen all right let's pass this let's let's move past this friend let's go to where we're going now all right east to west amen amen all right watch this now beloved this is uh who is he by the way who is he of where down the show 10 of Three Angels Broadcast Network 3abn several days ago he did a presentation entitled if not now then when how should God's Church deal with homo and what else my friends infanticide and feet decide now notice Danny shoten lay down my he was protesting he was crying aloud he was spearing not no I didn't watch the video all of it I just saw the first portion I want to share with you a clip right here and I want you to tell me what you think about this clip in light off what has transpired with the logo controversy either from the world or should we be using the logo from the Bible no question does anybody know when they voted to change our logo hmm I was in New York City somewhere in 97 98 I'm not sure if my mother recalls that and a letter came to the home from the conference and we saw a small uh five by seven uh pamphlet and in it was described the changing of the logo now who who recalls the date when they voted to change the logo anybody so who changed it who gave them the authority to do so who voted and what reasons did they give to change it what Bible what Spirit of Prophecy and if I'm going to change something you know what they say if it's not broken come on finish it yeah so what's wrong with the Three Angels why do you want to change it who asked those pertinent questions by the way if you're alive and you had the answers just send in that comment there email me let's talk about it friends back to this preacher here Mr protester hear what he said in light of the logo listen so today for those who think I'm paranoid now I'm gonna get into some really heavy stuff right now for those of you who think I'm paranoid or just homophobic let me first give you a few real life examples of deceptions affecting the leadership even in this church I love this church I love this church I never intend to to leave this church right that's not my intentions if if if they start teaching things as a church as a body if we start teaching things it's not biblical I'm going to leave I'm leaving because my loyalty is to God where's your loyalty he's leaving where's he going look at what is situated on the bottom right of the screen what is that a logo what is that how many of you recall the first three ABN logo was that it come on what's that it was that it what is that imagine God saying sinner come to this Tabernacle with cherubims and he walks up and you see three lines where is the sign so he may need to pack his bags right but where is he going and the Very sins he's protesting against in Loma Linda elsewhere have been supported by leadership in the general conference why do I say that the mere fact that there are moaned and silent on the point it means that they're complicit with the same apostasis am I clear all the points playing let's pray for The Elder here let's move on my friends watch this this is a controversial statement that has been floating around seventh day adventism and normally in Sabbath afternoons this time around after evangelism we will go into question and answer question and answer so this question was posed was posed this statement is found on the white eg1 estate of egy writings all right friends now this red box two small paragraphs I'm gonna magnify those two paragraphs okay it was written in 1901 September 24th okay and many use this statement to say it doesn't matter what's happening in the church stay in the churches now watch there's no qualification given so if there's apostasy in that local church stay right there say right there supported supported we I don't teach that wherever apostasy is among leadership after you pray with after you consult with if they continue to promote and teach them the heresy you should not stay there based on the Bible and the spirit of Prophecy you should not find somewhere else and go you should not because by beholding you become one changed and once you stay there and support it you strengthen the apostates I'm not speaking about the pews leadership I'm talking about all right so we are going to be addressing this statement here watch carefully so friends here it is let not the professed people of God think it's a privilege to separate from conference organization that they may show their supposed efficiency and I think our sisters here who also asked this question several weeks ago red words this is entirely opposed to God's word this is what friends no no please talk back to me so I'm so I'm clear that you're following the bouncing ball this is entirely opposed to God's order what is entirely opposed to God's order to separate from what conference organization let's read on there is need of perfect unity and love and this will appear when we learn of Jesus it is the plan of God that every church and every conference shall cherish the feeling of reciprocal dependence what friends depending on each other or I depend on you you depend on me reciprocal okay let me ask you a question if I say to you that this statement in 1901 shouldn't you get every other statement in sister-watch writings about Ministries comma churches comma publishing houses comma medical missionary institutions comma not being under schools comma not being under the conference would you say Amen to that that one statement Must Destroy every other who with intelligence would reason like that you take one statement that says it's not in God's order to separate from the conference organization use that to destroy every other statement that says the opposite and say look when you read those are the statements they must be understood based on this one how could that be that's the same argument the Sunday people use to justify Sunday what year is that written in 1901 right September look at the statement here what year is this at the bottom 1907 to whom their sister went right Elder Daniels was actually the general conference president watch this statement when my advice was asked in reference to the Madison School the watch School now when you hear school you're thinking uh classroom setting theater style uh a lectern and teacher the Madison School means an Enterprise right setting up training centers and raising up schools churches medical missionary sites and Publishing houses watch this by the way let's go there because I put it in your mind listen located 10 miles Northeast of Nashville Madison was an important spot in early Southern Seventh-Day adventism the Madison property often referred to as a medicine farm so you have management School management Farm was purchased in what year 1904 with the financial assistance of Nelly uh Gillard and the prophetic vision of Ellen White it says spearheaded by EA Sutherland Percy Megan the medicine contingent contingent now would spawn a collection of what schools hospitals Industries and what churches around the South so what were they establishing all right watch careful now let's go right here I'll come back to that watch us now friends it says when my advice was asked in reference to the Madison School I said remain as you are there is danger in binding every working agency everyone Elder Buchanan I mean should I go there now you say no are you my conscience preacher listen I agree with you there is a danger in binding every working agency under the what friends the dictation of the conference the Lord did not design that this should be so friends which statement was inspired the 1901 or 1907 which one which one was inspired which one both were inspired so why the difference circumstances what's the difference circumstances now here is a counter argument to this statement here on the screen some would say well that's true that's how medicine began not with the conference but later on in years right later on maybe a decade after or so some of the various institutions they established came back under the conference so that means you must negate this instruction here who is in that way because circumstances changed does not destroy the council that was given have ever read in the Bible the Lord repented have you why would God repent that would be a good Bible question so let me not give too much on that okay but why did God repent because circumstances changed so he promised destruction right and what happened it was coming but they were they repented so God withheld it God repented oh that's the answer right dear friends can God sin so repent it doesn't mean to sin and repent and to convert amen so God changed because circumstances change he withheld destruction one example Nineveh minivan amen it's clear God withheld destruction let's continue it says the Lord did not design that this should be what are the next two words in blue the circumstances were such the burden-bearers in the Madison School could not bind up their work with the conference I knew their situation and when many of the leading men in our conferences ignore them because they did not Place their school under the the conference dictation I was shown that they would not be helped by making themselves amenable to what the conference they had better remain as led by God amenable to him to work out his plans but this matter need not be blazed abroad so friends what if the circumstances that were Rife and prevalent in this time 1907 when the instruction was given what if they are prevalent today would it be okay then to follow the same instructions or do you not believe in inspiration is inspiration it was given because of circle says are they alive in the world today so how could you negate the statement and because they can they say well later on some of those churches were brought under the conference does that negate the instruction sometimes men reason as if they are infants and it's either they are ignorant listen attentively either they are ignorant or they lack comprehension skills they lack intelligence or they have a Sinister agenda I wonder what it is which one let's move on Modern paragraph it says means have been held from them Madison because in the organization and management of the Madison School it was not placed under the control of the conference but the reason why this school wasn't owned and controlled by the conference have not been duly considered move on then she said watch carefully friends how much of this I want to give you watch carefully you want all of it some with all of it red words Huntsville first sentence Alabama Madison listen in the matter of the Madison School there has been a standing off from them because they were not under the ownership and control of some conference all right it says this is a question thou should sometimes be considered but it is not the Lord's plan that means should be withheld from medicine because they were what I want to ask you a question what antithesis do we hear to that statement every tithe every offering must go weird huh so you hear one thing but read something else Luke 12 verse 1 Beware of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees the leaven of the leaders hypocrisy that's what it says right there that means means can go to where institutions not connected to the conference let's read on the attitude with some of our Brethren have assumed toward this Enterprise shows it is not wise for every every working agency to be under the dictation of conference officers there are Harmony they're all is that what sister white wrote they're all no there are some Enterprises on the one certain conditions that will produce better results if one standing alone that's abc123 is that clear friends now that's why you you would never hear yours truly say every church is in apostasy or everybody come what I'm simply calling people out of War apostasy wherever it is conference lines or self-supporting lines now do we have to wait second do we have to wait to see apostasy and use that as the reason to stand alone no no no you don't have to give me a Biblical example of that where somebody didn't work with the conference the sanhegan council but yet stood alone in Ministry John the Baptist who was he by the way before I get to Christ who was he by the way John the Baptist whose son was he Zacharias who was Zacharias high priest so in the natural order of things what and who what office should John the Baptist have assumed high priest priesthood but what happened God didn't call him to become a high priest a pastor an elder in the Sanhedrin Conference of synagogues he had a self-supporting and independent Ministry of the conference song Enterprises can stand alone I'm going to say this many of these men they frame their talking points as if there's only one side that has an issue as if you folks over here who are self-supporting you despise the brethren in the conference and separate yourself you will never hear them look on the other angle and say those men in the conference don't want to hear truth hypocrisy and they in the conference will never invite some men to come and preach in their pulpits it's always one perspective Sinister agenda when you can be balanced you can be bought and sold you're a Slave let's move on from that I told you you're going to get it what year is this at the bottom what year what year do you remember hold on because everything I say I must give you receipts receipts you remember a man whose name is he's alive Bill not and he wrote an article says time to marginalize he says it's time to ostracize men like dog Bachelor anyone who preaches against women's ordination should not be brought into SDA pulpits what is that separation right let's come here what year is this on the screen friends 1903 okay notice now this is Ellen White and she's speaking of her son Edson white that's the first two sentences blue words just a white rights he it's in white her son will be accounted out of what out of line but many ought to be out of the lines that have been maintained to be the regular routine how many no some few many and unless they themselves the conference line come into line they will say we are God's Church so the conference Brethren will say we are God's Temple we are God's Church sister white says unless that Temple is purified cleansed and Sanctified God would not give them his presence in the temple of which they boast those who would have rejoiced to see something done were all determined to give one no recognition to whom it's in white as a person or the one his work why because he did not work in the break what is a regular lines the conference what year is that but they caught 1901. now which one which one came after 1901 oh friends listen God has presented before you how he regarded the regular lines it says it needs to be broken as a word a partridge vessel is broken and what reconstructed how could you say 1901 Must Destroy this statement put this reference down in great controversy 371 sister white rights she says not one statement should be used not once saying of Christ let's fix it properly not one thing of Christ should be used to destroy another you can't do that friends they're all inspired let's let's move on now look at this statement here what year is that at the bottom 1907 where was Sister white in 1907 or even before 1907 where was she because I mean that was when it was written where was she what was she doing she said the churches that her son established outside of the conference she was there to dedicate those churches 1907. now here is a counter argument yeah but some of those churches decades after were brought back into the conference does that negate the statement ignorance a lack of mental Acumen Lord have mercy let's move on from that and there it is stay as you are you don't need to unite with them all right what year is this first line blue words 1901 who is Sister what writing to who was A.G Daniels General Conference president and what does she write she says pharisaism red words Ferry says him in the Christian world is what not extinct she says in the SDA church we have a Pharisees him so she's connecting the Sanhedrin council with the General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists what year is that in 1901 what does she say the regular lines may prove a failure and a want a sneer conference lines for instance 1901. 1901 again she says shall the regular lines which say every mind shall be what what's the word controlled not every working agency church should be under the control of the conference 1903 1907 1901 how many more statements you want every mind shall be controlled by two or three Minds at Battle Creek continue to Bear Swift well oh pastor we have 13 divisions now we have more than two or three it's not the amount of men is what you're teaching and what they're supporting and promoting that's the problem because if you have how many how many men ruled Israel in the time of King Saul was it not Samuel was he faithful to God let's move on shall men go to the regular lines to see whether they will be permitted to labor or shall they go out and work as best they can depending on their own work we don't need their ordination nor their approval go to work for God all right friend how much more let me see something here all right 1901 James Edson white she says the Lord has blessed my son in the south second sentence God grant that the voices which have been so quickly raised to say that all the money invested in the work must go through the appointed Channel at Battle Creek shall what not be heard Battle Creek today is what now there in Spring Michigan or the one in in Maryland DC Silver Spring Maryland it is their privilege to give what direct Aid and what assistance to missions that's it friends it's clear there it is again Edson white past that friends write this down that reference please very very important it says it is as hard today to break away from what what did you all hear that everybody read words what it says it is as hard today to break away from the regular lines as it was in whose day in Christ's day what does Breakaway mean huh what does Breakaway mean listen we have had great light let us not become narrow let us break the bonds which bind us hard to break away from what the regular lines now is Sister white saying Everybody Must Break Free at the conference but where their circumstances you can stand how separate alone with Christ with Christ with Christ okay go to John 15. do you know what is startling among these men they give you several quotes and hardly no Bible no Bible and that's why their statements and arguments are convoluted as we would say Tom foodery where are we going to John what chapter go to John 15. what does verse 1 say in John 15 friends what does Christ saying I am the what the true vine listen to what sister white says Bible Spirit of Prophecy this is the Desire of Ages she writes I am the True Vine listen the Jews had always regarded the vine as the most noble of plants and a type of all that was powerful excellent and fruitful Israel had been what represented as a what Vine which God had planted red words the Jews based the hope of Salvation on the fact of what friends their connection with Israel can Church connection save anybody what saves What Not Who what saves truth who saves who is he the way the truth the life listen what Christ now says I am the real Vine think not that through a connection with the church you may become partakers of the life of God and inheritors of his promise so me alone a spiritual life received that Bible and spirit of Prophecy how then could you believe that sister white is going to write anything different John 15 let's move on sister white rights the Pharisees declared themselves the children of Abraham Christ told them that this claim could be established only by doing what the works of Abraham blue words a mere lineal descent from Abraham was of no value without a spiritual connection with Christ your connection means nothing and that's what they're preaching stay in the church they're preaching salvation through the church and people are eating and drinking that Hook Line and Sinker deceive they haven't read nor prayed over this for themselves one more statement all the Desire of Ages all right it says descent do I want this one you could take note of the reference I'll move on from this one okay argue for this one page 107 paragraph one John the Baptist said the ax is laid weird at the root red words not by its name but by its fruit is the value of a tree determined if the fruit is worthless the name cannot save the tree from oh would the name save you was Seventh-Day Adventists save you I cannot save you what must we have what must we reveal what must we manifest the fruit last sentence profession was profession is worthless if our lives and characters are not in harmony with God's law we are not his people and Christ made this statement John 15 before he was crucified and Christ's crucifixion typifies the sunderl it's relevant right now and applicable let me see how much more of this I can give you than I'll close go to Matthew 15. where are we going to friends Matthew 15. let's take this Matthew 15 look at verse 7. what did Christ preacher give me 10. what did Christ preach in verse 7 and call the leaders Hypocrites right Hypocrites skip one down with me to verse number nine what were they teaching men's doctrines all right for God's Commandments and they were worshiping God in vain skip on down to verse number verse number 12. the disciples came to Christ Lord you offended the leaders of the church Christ the Christ apologize he said nothing wrong he spoke present truth no need for apology look at verse number 14. what did Christ say now verse 13 every plan my father had not planted shall be won rooted up let them alone what look at the statement the disciples had been much disappointed that Jesus had not tried to secure what everybody the cooperation of the leaders in Israel they felt it was a mistake for Jesus not to strengthen his cause by securing the support of these influential men past Enriquez why do you not work with the conference leaders ask them the same question and reverse it and see what they tell you that's them watch it says the corporation of such men listen as the disciples were anxious to secure would have betrayed the work of God into the hands of its home birth enemies is that clear friends some people will see this and still say I don't see it do you know why they're blind they're blind they're blind they're blind let's go to Lou chapter nine Bible Spirit of Prophecy where we're going to France Luke Chapter now look what this says in Luke chapter 9. let them alone by the way by the way hold your place in Luke 9 go to Acts 2 leave them alone acts what chapter now Acts chapter 2. this is on the day of Pentecost right probation had not yet been closed on the Jewish Church look at Acts chapter 2 verse 40. the disciples said to the people save yourselves from this world unto Ward Generations what's untoward mean corrupt meaning leave them alone verse 41 they were baptized verse 42 the people after being baptized did they go back to those apostate leaders yes or no did they my friends no they fellowshipped with whom those who had truth those of Our Truth Bible do you remember in John chapter 6 when the majority of Christ disciples left him and Christ turned to the twelve and said to them will you also go what did Peter say to whom shall we go you have what the words of eternal life so what were they following truth truth truth but those men went right back to the conference of that day before I take Luke 9 have you ever heard people say to rebut this sister white died in the church I wonder which church you got in sister white preach in the Adventist churches SDA churches she had credentials in the SDA churches so that must be used to negate her statements do you see the fallacy in the reasoning so because she died a Seventh-Day Adventist that must you be used to negate that she says on the several circumstances it's okay for churches Enterprises to stand separate from the conference control who would reason that way want to ask a question did Christ preach in the synagogues did he yes he did did sister white preach in the SDA churches yes she did did Jesus also simultaneously set up a Ministry Church training school baptizing people not with the Sanhedrin yeah did sister white simultaneously support Ministries churches schools not with the conference yeah so where's the problem it's in your minds that's where it is you have a Sinister agenda it's clear for those who want to see it is the Bible true go to Luke 9. Luke 9 you have to use Bible and spread of Prophecy and some people still won't believe this I am simply making sure it's on the record let me hear some my footsteps Luke chapter 9 in verse 49 and John answered Master we saw one doing what casting out devils in thy name what happened we forbade him why because he did not follow us he was not with our ministry do you realize that these were disciples not with the conference and yet they were telling Christ please support seek the approval of the Sanhedrin many of you who are sitting here might have the same sentiment Pastor henriquez I come to save to serve but please work with the conference please the same thing with Christ 12 disciples nothing new Under the Sun nothing new here they are now in Luke 9. they are saying Master this man is not under our ministry and control so he should not be preaching let's do everything on social media to shut him down let's misconstrue statements publish them to deceive the people to stop listening and following him same situation here go to verse 15. what did Christ say now you have done well no forbid him not why listen what sister white says here friend she says watch carefully come on where is it all right she says Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and that man didn't follow us listen now James and John had taught James and John had thought that in checking this man they had had in view their Lord's honor and listen to me these preachers on social media in the SDA Church they called themselves champions of the faith we are champions for the conference do you know who they are they are modern day Dr EK again who was Dr EK against have you read the book great controversy who was Dr Eck again Martin Luther the Protestant reformer they are the modern day Dr Eric okay listen James and John had thought that in checking this man they had had in viewed their Lord's honor they began to see that their reward they were what so what was at the root of all those polls and videos jealousy jealousy but afterwards they acknowledge their error and accepted Christ's reproof listen none who showed themselves in any way friendly to Christ if they are preaching present truth leave them alone listen now when Jesus was no longer personally among them and the work was left in their hands they must not indulge award narrow exclusive spirit but manifest the same Farm reaching sympathy which they had seen in whom in their master I digress on that point beloved do you realize question for you which of these two men began their Ministry first Jesus or John the Baptist who John the Baptist was John's Ministry with the conference of that day no what about Christ no all right when Christ came on the scene did he say John you have to close up shop you gotta you got to stop Ministry and join me that happen what happened both were working even John disciples didn't say we would stop preaching and John cries no they had separate Ministries that's Bible brothers and sisters Bible Bible this idea of everyone coming under one head is potpourri that's what it is let's close let's close let's close let's close go to numbers 11. where are we going to numbers 11. so New Testament go to Old Testament now now I won't read this but put the reference down numbers 11 verse 25 pardon me verse 24 numbers 11 verse 25 through verse 29. God gave his spirit upon 70 elders to help Moses in the work and out of 70 68 went one way and two did not follow the 68. do you know what Joshua did yeah the same Joshua he ran to Moses Moses you need to check these two men they won't follow us and what did Moses say Joshua do you know what's in your heart for those two men Envy Envy Old Testament jealousy New Testament look at verse 29 with me where are we going to it says and Moses now said unto Joshua enviest thou for my sake what God not all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them let's close now I keep saying that here it is Friends it says that watch carefully these men will never give the right mode to other minds they have not grown up to the first stature of men and women in Christ they simply live the name of Christian but they are not fitted for the work of God and never will be until they are born again and learned their ABCs in the religion of Christ Jesus red words there is hope in One Direction take the young man and woman and place them where they will come as little as possible in contact with who no no Babylon no Babylon our churches so was Sister white calling for a separation from the conference here's my last Point hold on I'm going to step on a tour right now did you wear your steel toe boots listen volume eight page 310 Our Savior did not encourage any to attend the rabbinical schools of his day no I won't drop the mic I'm going to hold the mic you see the world drops mics we don't drop Mike amen we hold the mics amen the world drop mics we don't drop mics we give the trumpet a certain sound this thing sound what would the rabbinical schools of his day be today name them Andrews Southern Loma Linda awkward name them puc La Sierra name them Walla Walla name them uh the one in Jamaica there ncu same thing the rabbinical school's office day that's it friends he wouldn't he would not so would that be classified as calling people out of church and when they go to when they go to our schools do they leave without debt or in debt the majority that's not God's will not God's will okay let me close right here beloved I've heard people say only conference churches are going to finish the work only people in the conference listen watch only people in the conference are going to finish the work who believes that raise a hand not one hand come on who believes that only people in the SD a conference will finish the work anything that will transpire in the last days we should find it in the Bible First Advent or before that at the first Advent which men first receive the early reign oh so I'm speaking to myself so Andrew which man first received the early Reign at the first Advent Pentecost the Sanhedrin people or the ones with Christ which one which the latter group the 120 to 120. worthy in the upper room where were the others in the dark and synagogues 120. 120. they received the Holy Spirit first I wonder why what were they following truth what were the other folks following man-made tradition do you see his friends hold on but were there some good folks over there you remember Nicodemus Pastor you said you were closing huh you said you were a closing pastor neither Joseph nor Nicodemus had openly accepted Christ while he was living they knew that such a step would exclude them from the conference Sanhedrin and they hope to protect Christ by the influence in its councils what does that mean we can stay in the conference and still preach president truth for a Time they had seemed to succeed listen but the Wily priests seeing their favor to Christ had thwarted their plans in their absence Christ had been what condemned delivered to be crucified now that Christ was dead they no longer Nicodemus no longer what concealed their attachment to him here's my point there's some pastors right now in the SDA conference who are timid and a fruit to stand for all the truth they will stand later on a few a few will stand later on we are biblical example for that I feel that's why you would never hear me say all our in apostasy there are few who will have to come out when Nicodemus and Joseph came out they had to separate themselves from what the apostate leadership they had to the leadership they had to some will come out but those who think now we can stay right here a day is going to come you'll have to make a decision make what a decision that's New Testament what about Obadiah in the time of whom Elijah Obadiah go tell Ahab Elijah is here what if I go and preach the Elijah's message to Ahab Ahab will chop off my head and that's why many conference pastors like Obadiah will not preach the Elijah's message calling even their own superiors to repentance they won't do it why paycheck why retirement why uh what else accolades why they don't want to be diffract why ordination why all of it afraid they're selling out cries for 30 pieces of silver 120 I'm closing now 120 received the Holy Spirit first and then they went out and began to preach the majority of the Jews had the last opportunity the majority rejected some came in accept the truth among those who came in the Bible says there were priests who came in they were priests let's be faithful to the Bible we don't have to skew the Bible to suit our sinful agenda preach the word some of them will come out of error and stand on the platform of Truth okay what have we learned today were things clearer were things made plain where things may play So if you think only force in the conference will finish this work you are ignorant of the Bible The Men Who first received the early Reign were men not with the conference how will it be in the last days who first will get the lettering oh pastor guys I can't see that only those who are living and following present truth wherever they are they will be the ones and if they're faithful they're not going to be supported by those men and we pray for them do you think Christ prayed for Caiaphas of course he did of course but was he praying for himself no he was not and that's where I close we have to pray for ourselves study for What study for ourselves we cannot just say follow truth we must know truth so we can follow through study for yourselves let's pray Father in heaven thank you for these words this evening may we take heed to what we have heard may we be found faithful firmly standing upon the Bible and spirit of Prophecy what you have joined together may we not put asunder or separate in order to accommodate our jealousies Envy towards others and our Sinister ulterior motives may we Heavenly Father be found as living examples of your truth may we not keep the angels on the outside in books on buildings on papers but may we allow them to come into our hearts convict convert and may we now go and share with others may we not eat the leaven of the apostates may we shun it and call people to truth may this place be a lighthouse locally and internationally now Lord we pray as we meet this new week Keep Us Faithful may we claim Matthew 6 give us this day our daily bread and may we not doubt you will provide Lord we love you and we know you love us may we grow to love you more reflect your character more we will face crises daily this week but may we remember to claim your promises put pep in our Step Prayer endurance patience with a song to remove discouragement we thank you for hearing us prepare us for tomorrow midday power surge wherein We Begin the series seven last days on Earth experiencing the seven Sanctuary Feasts is our prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen

[15.7s] we're grateful for the blessings you
[17.5s] have bestowed upon us today
[21.2s] We Gather here
[23.3s] this afternoon to dig deep into your
[25.7s] words
[27.3s] to bring clarity
[29.7s] to the controversies all around us
[32.9s] blessed us for these few moments
[35.3s] grant us Heavenly I Salve that we may
[39.1s] discern truth
[41.8s] that we may also identify error
[45.7s] under any guise
[47.5s] bless us now we pray
[49.4s] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[54.1s] I want to turn your attention to Luke
[56.0s] Chapter 12. let's turn there Luke
[59.0s] chapter 12.
[61.9s] how many of you are
[64.8s] anxious for tomorrow's
[67.8s] service
[70.1s] beginning of this
[72.6s] final seven days on Earth
[76.1s] experience
[78.1s] seven Sanctuary feasts are you ready for
[81.3s] it friends
[83.2s] I'm ready by God's grace now this
[87.0s] evening as we spend a few moments
[88.9s] addressing these controversies I'm going
[92.6s] to ask you kindly to get a writing
[94.3s] instrument notepads and the questions
[97.5s] that come to your mind as we go
[99.9s] throughout this by God's grace at the
[103.2s] end I will accommodate those questions
[106.8s] I'm going to get my
[109.7s] iPad by God's grace and those of you
[112.4s] online can also tune in and send in your
[117.2s] questions let's turn quickly to Luke
[119.8s] chapter 12 and today we're going to
[122.8s] continue from where we left off on this
[126.3s] morning I was blessed this morning how
[128.5s] about you
[130.0s] were those points clear
[131.9s] as we looked at the sanctuary
[134.5s] you see friends everything that we
[136.6s] profess to believe as Seventh-day
[139.8s] Adventist we believe we can prove those
[144.1s] truths from the Bible from the sanctuary
[147.1s] am I right
[148.3s] yes so what about the logo
[151.3s] the actual brand of this church should
[154.9s] we be able to prove that also from the
[157.8s] sanctuary
[158.8s] yes and that's why we are addressing
[162.2s] this all-important subject that's not
[165.6s] what God plays on his Tabernacle
[169.4s] is that what he put dear friends
[171.6s] some individuals have taken this logo
[174.8s] and actually stated that apparent cross
[179.4s] is actually inverted
[183.7s] and inverted crosses are connected to
[187.5s] witchcraft
[189.7s] just follow the top end of that
[193.0s] so-called cross
[195.8s] when God speaks does he speak plainly
[199.9s] and the churches with this and these
[202.6s] logos on them if those Tabernacles were
[206.8s] in the time of Moses and God inspired a
[210.4s] sinner to bring his lamb what Christ
[213.2s] have led that sinner to these
[215.6s] Tabernacles
[217.1s] why
[218.9s] wrong address wrong address
[222.8s] wrong symbol wrong address
[226.7s] they call these three lines Three Angels
[230.3s] they call that cherubims
[232.4s] that is
[234.2s] a disgrace to God there it is friends
[237.7s] ecumenical
[239.3s] ecumenical
[241.3s] straight from Babylon now what if here
[244.5s] at safe to serve one day you walked into
[247.4s] the church and I had two logos in the
[250.6s] front two logos in the center two logos
[254.1s] on the walls
[255.5s] The Three Angels on one side and the
[258.7s] flickering Flame
[260.6s] over a so-called book and a cross on the
[263.6s] other side what would you think
[267.2s] what would you think talk to me what
[268.8s] what would come to your mind
[270.5s] but I said you do not know what would
[272.6s] have come to my mind you don't want to
[274.1s] hear it what what would come to your
[275.9s] mind
[278.4s] if I lost my mind
[281.0s] am I insane
[283.4s] have I stepped off the platform what
[285.8s] else
[287.4s] am I confused
[289.4s] do you know you have churches out there
[292.3s] that claim to believe in present truth
[296.3s] claim to be preaching the sermons and
[300.2s] the messages for the hour and they have
[303.1s] two logos why
[306.0s] why would they have two logos The Three
[308.9s] Angels on one side or maybe on a website
[312.5s] that they oversee but at the actual
[315.2s] church building they have that the
[317.5s] flickering Flame
[319.5s] from Babylon why would they do that
[322.4s] what now
[324.4s] double-minded want to please everybody
[326.4s] that's called compromise
[330.4s] one is of god Bible one is of Babylon of
[334.2s] Satan that's compromise what would
[336.6s] Elijah say
[338.2s] if God be God
[340.0s] serve him but if bail
[342.6s] serve him how long hold you between
[347.8s] two opinions not six friends that's
[350.4s] called compromise that's called
[352.3s] hypocrisy why because if you connect
[355.9s] yourself with this organization they
[358.7s] want to make sure you have that logo
[361.9s] no there's several things I want to say
[363.8s] here how many of you remember those days
[366.0s] you went to some Churches especially if
[368.6s] you are second third fourth generation
[372.2s] SDA do you remember uh pardon me not
[375.2s] that
[376.7s] uh do you remember this logo here
[379.9s] or even a rendition of it
[382.6s] on the buildings
[384.4s] the glass thin windows
[386.7s] uh maybe I I took it out that the true
[390.8s] logo
[392.0s] right there in the center the true logo
[394.1s] on the glass stand windows
[397.3s] some Churches still had the logo there
[400.1s] do you know why they have they have not
[402.7s] gotten around to it yet
[405.2s] to remodel it
[407.0s] but soon they will
[408.8s] and others may still have the logo but
[411.9s] the message has changed
[415.4s] the experience has changed
[419.0s] am I right or wrong
[420.6s] you know I'm speaking the truth as God
[422.7s] lives and as you think about it as they
[425.9s] have removed the logo
[427.7s] they've also removed the message let's
[430.6s] take a look at the first angel
[432.7s] what says that first cherubim of chapter
[435.8s] 14 of the Revelation verse 7 fear God
[439.3s] right say it with me fear God give glory
[443.0s] to him why the our office judgment is
[446.4s] calm and worship him who made Heaven
[449.7s] Earth sea and The Fountains of waters
[452.2s] what's number one
[453.8s] fear God what does it mean to fear God
[457.0s] fear God fear God
[459.2s] Victor overseen to despise and hate evil
[463.6s] Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 13 the fear
[467.0s] of the Lord is to hate evil Pride
[470.7s] arrogancy how do we know they have
[473.4s] changed the message are they not
[475.7s] preaching we will never get victory over
[478.2s] sin we'll be sinning until Christ comes
[481.3s] what does that mean
[483.0s] not only has the logo change but what
[485.9s] the message has changed
[488.9s] then comes give Glory what does that
[491.4s] mean to give Glory
[493.5s] Health reform dress reform tempering
[496.4s] they are thrown out Health reform just
[499.4s] reform Temperance what about judgment
[502.6s] they've rejected October 22nd 1844.
[506.6s] what about worship God on the seventh
[509.0s] day Sabbath have you not heard do you
[512.2s] not remember the actual cry that we want
[516.0s] to hold Sabbath surfaces on Sunday
[519.3s] mornings for those who have to work on
[521.9s] Sabbath and cannot come to church on
[524.7s] God's Sabbath day Sabbath you can come
[527.1s] on Sunday mornings
[529.0s] and our church
[531.1s] why the logo has changed the merchandise
[535.2s] has also changed
[538.1s] that's it
[540.1s] it would it would be weird as I said
[542.6s] bizarre as I said this morning you walk
[545.3s] into a Bed Bath and Beyond store and you
[548.5s] see no what do they sell inside there
[553.1s] so clothing they sell soap
[557.5s] okay bath soap right okay and what else
[560.8s] Etc you walk inside there and what are
[563.1s] they selling
[564.5s] watermelon
[566.2s] cantaloupe come on now it's it's it's
[568.8s] it's it's fall season okay
[572.1s] broccoli
[573.5s] collards
[575.1s] right you would say where am I
[578.7s] the sign is correct but the merchandise
[581.8s] is incorrect or they don't have the sign
[586.3s] and don't have the message
[589.1s] Luke chapter 12 go to verse 1. it says
[592.2s] be weary after laughing of whom the
[595.7s] Pharisees which is what friends
[598.3s] hypocrisy hypocrisy and that's why this
[601.7s] morning I spent time on this
[606.4s] this is God's true sign
[610.3s] past that won't spend time on this okay
[612.8s] everybody read the red words with me I
[615.8s] was told that men will employ every
[619.4s] policy to make less prominent the
[622.1s] difference between the faith our
[624.1s] Seventh-Day Adventists and those who
[626.6s] observe the first day of the week past
[629.2s] that all right friends okay now notice
[632.6s] again they will say we must remove the
[636.4s] banner or sign the banner or sign and
[641.2s] what sign that God put on his building
[643.1s] what sign is on new Jerusalem's
[646.5s] Tabernacle the Angels at the gates on
[650.1s] the Tabernacle gate and Tabernacle past
[652.1s] that won't spend time on that okay I saw
[655.0s] some reaching out their hands to remove
[657.2s] the banner and to obscure fix that and
[660.4s] to obscure its significance I don't want
[663.5s] to keep you here too long all right
[664.8s] let's move on from this
[666.8s] we cannot know and what they want to say
[670.1s] friends those who are standing faithful
[673.1s] to God
[674.8s] in observing the true message and the
[678.7s] true logo that they are the ones who
[681.5s] have started a new organization
[684.9s] now I I wish I had something here
[688.5s] on what side of the four corners or four
[692.1s] sides of the sanctuary it was the good
[694.5s] place on what side
[696.3s] East Side so they traveled from where
[699.2s] East to where West so what what
[703.4s] direction did the Angels cherubims fly
[707.8s] east to west from the gate to where the
[711.5s] door of the Tabernacle holy Place inner
[714.8s] Veil and then most holy is traveling
[717.4s] we're east to west and that's why by
[719.8s] God's grace we turn our logo with the
[723.6s] angels with trumpets not going right to
[727.0s] left
[728.3s] but what
[730.1s] not going left to right but what right
[733.4s] to left East to West so when someone
[736.3s] sees safe to serve's logo
[739.9s] they'll ask a question why are your
[742.4s] angels flying right to left
[745.2s] what will you say
[746.9s] let's go to the sanctuary
[749.7s] these cherubims fly how right to left
[753.5s] East to West will you say Amen friends
[755.8s] we have to make sure we come as close to
[759.2s] scripture as possible
[762.0s] it's a sign
[766.1s] what if someone says come meet me here
[768.6s] and remove you remember we were going to
[772.0s] evangelize and evangelist John Ryan sent
[775.9s] me this uh the direction
[778.3s] and instead of putting let's say other
[780.6s] member of the address instead of putting
[782.4s] uh John's Road he put John's Avenue
[787.2s] well here we have John 1 and John's
[789.5s] Avenue
[790.8s] I'm looking for John's Avenue when it
[793.2s] should be John's Road
[795.0s] but John is correct but what's incorrect
[798.4s] Avenue or road is it important now which
[802.0s] direction you're flying
[804.4s] or brothers and sisters is it important
[806.4s] all right let's move on from that there
[809.8s] it is friends you know what let's turn
[811.7s] the first Timothy chapter three go there
[814.3s] with me and First Timothy chapter three
[817.6s] and verse number 16 God's word says uh
[822.3s] without controversy great is the mystery
[827.0s] of godliness
[828.8s] greatest watch Friends the mystery of
[832.4s] godliness
[834.6s] and there is a controversy going on
[837.2s] right now
[838.4s] and that controversy is stay in the SDA
[842.9s] churches
[844.1s] versus
[847.2s] come out of apostasy is that clear
[850.1s] friends
[851.0s] and those who give the latter cry come
[854.0s] out of apostasy
[856.3s] those in the former group who say you're
[859.3s] calling people out of the SDA Church
[863.5s] that's what they say
[865.3s] that's hypocrisy that's not correct they
[868.4s] are creating what we call a straw man
[872.2s] because Andrew Enriquez yours truly have
[874.8s] never said come out of SDA churches
[879.3s] you have ordered me what have I always
[881.2s] say
[882.6s] come out of what a past State local SDA
[886.8s] churches
[888.1s] as well as come out of a prostate
[892.0s] non-conference churches it goes both
[895.0s] ways
[897.1s] but when they preach and teach they're
[899.4s] calling you to church organization
[902.9s] volume 4 page two go to Isaiah chapter
[905.6s] one where are you going to my friends
[908.2s] Isaiah chapter one what makes our
[911.3s] Seventh-day Adventist one more time red
[913.9s] words notice how sister white quoted in
[917.1s] the blue words the Three Angels messages
[920.3s] of course she mentioned first and second
[923.1s] that's present truth then she said a red
[926.3s] word those who pass through these
[929.0s] experiences are to be as firm as a rock
[932.5s] to the principles that have made us what
[936.1s] everybody Seventh Day Adventist volume
[939.5s] what's that volume nine
[942.1s] testimonies for the church volume 9 page
[945.2s] 48 says let ministers and people bear in
[948.9s] mind there may affect that their names
[952.0s] are registered on the church's books
[956.5s] will not save them oh but I thought if
[959.8s] your name is not on a local conference
[962.8s] SDA Church you're not going to be saved
[968.7s] that was volume nine what page I gave
[971.0s] you page 48 pass this won't spend time
[974.9s] on that I covered that this morning we
[977.6s] cannot now enter into any new
[980.2s] Organization for this would mean a pass
[983.8s] to see from the word everybody apostasy
[986.5s] from the truth now watch this watch

[1157.1s] I was in New York City
[1159.0s] somewhere in 97 98 I'm not sure if my
[1162.4s] mother recalls that and a letter came to
[1165.6s] the home from the conference and we saw

[1212.2s] Angels why do you want to change it who

[1220.6s] answers just send in that comment there
[1223.1s] email me let's talk about it friends
[1225.0s] back to this preacher here Mr protester
[1228.9s] hear what he said in light of the logo
[1232.5s] listen
[1233.7s] so today for those who think I'm
[1235.7s] paranoid now I'm gonna get into some
[1237.9s] really heavy stuff right now for those
[1239.8s] of you who think I'm paranoid or just
[1241.6s] homophobic let me first give you a few
[1243.9s] real life examples of deceptions
[1246.1s] affecting the leadership even in this
[1249.3s] church I love this church
[1251.1s] I love this church I never intend to to
[1253.9s] leave this church
[1255.8s] right that's not my intentions if if if
[1258.4s] they start teaching things as a church
[1260.6s] as a body if we start teaching things
[1262.6s] it's not biblical I'm going to leave I'm
[1264.6s] leaving because my loyalty is to God
[1266.7s] where's your loyalty
[1269.5s] he's leaving where's he going
[1273.3s] look at what is situated
[1276.9s] on the bottom right of the screen what
[1279.3s] is that
[1281.1s] a logo
[1282.4s] what is that
[1283.9s] how many of you recall the first three
[1285.8s] ABN logo
[1287.4s] was that it
[1288.8s] come on what's that it
[1290.5s] was that it what is that
[1295.2s] imagine God saying sinner come to this
[1298.0s] Tabernacle with cherubims and he walks
[1300.6s] up and you see three lines
[1302.2s] where is the sign
[1306.8s] so he may need to pack his bags right
[1309.7s] but where is he going
[1311.8s] and the Very sins he's protesting
[1314.2s] against
[1315.9s] in Loma Linda elsewhere
[1319.0s] have been supported by leadership in the
[1322.0s] general conference why do I say that the
[1324.6s] mere fact that there are moaned and
[1327.3s] silent
[1328.6s] on the point it means that they're
[1330.7s] complicit with the same apostasis
[1334.5s] am I clear
[1335.9s] all the points playing let's pray for
[1338.0s] The Elder here let's move on my friends
[1340.0s] watch this this is a controversial
[1343.0s] statement
[1344.1s] that has been floating around seventh
[1347.4s] day adventism
[1349.2s] and normally in Sabbath afternoons this
[1352.0s] time around after evangelism we will go
[1355.1s] into question and answer question and
[1358.0s] answer so this question was posed
[1361.0s] was posed
[1363.2s] this statement is found on the white eg1
[1368.7s] estate of egy writings all right friends
[1372.5s] now this red box two small paragraphs
[1376.2s] I'm gonna magnify those two paragraphs
[1379.6s] okay it was written in 1901 September
[1383.8s] 24th okay and many use this statement to
[1389.4s] say
[1390.1s] it doesn't matter what's happening in
[1392.5s] the church stay in the churches now
[1394.9s] watch there's no qualification given
[1399.7s] so if there's apostasy in that local
[1403.2s] church stay right there
[1405.6s] say right there supported supported we I
[1408.7s] don't teach that
[1409.9s] wherever apostasy is among leadership
[1413.7s] after you pray with after you consult
[1417.8s] with if they continue to promote and
[1421.4s] teach them the heresy
[1423.6s] you should not stay there based on the
[1426.4s] Bible and the spirit of Prophecy you
[1428.3s] should not find somewhere else and go
[1430.3s] you should not because by beholding you
[1433.5s] become one changed and once you stay
[1436.7s] there and support it you strengthen the
[1439.8s] apostates
[1441.3s] I'm not speaking about the pews
[1443.4s] leadership I'm talking about
[1446.0s] all right so we are going to be
[1448.3s] addressing this statement here watch
[1450.6s] carefully so friends here it is let not
[1453.6s] the professed people of God think it's a
[1456.7s] privilege to separate from conference
[1460.6s] organization that they may show their
[1464.0s] supposed efficiency and I think our
[1466.5s] sisters here who also asked this
[1468.2s] question several weeks ago
[1470.4s] red words this is entirely opposed to
[1474.2s] God's word
[1476.2s] this is what friends
[1477.9s] no no please talk back to me so I'm so
[1480.4s] I'm clear that you're following the
[1482.2s] bouncing ball this is entirely opposed
[1485.5s] to God's order what is entirely opposed
[1487.9s] to God's order
[1490.0s] to separate from what conference
[1492.4s] organization let's read on there is need
[1496.0s] of perfect unity and love and this will
[1499.9s] appear when we learn of Jesus it is the
[1503.5s] plan of God that every church and every
[1506.7s] conference shall cherish the feeling of
[1509.7s] reciprocal dependence what friends
[1512.8s] depending on each other or I depend on
[1515.6s] you you depend on me reciprocal okay let
[1518.3s] me ask you a question
[1519.5s] if I say to you that this statement in
[1522.4s] 1901 shouldn't you get every other
[1525.1s] statement in sister-watch writings about
[1528.3s] Ministries comma churches comma
[1532.7s] publishing houses comma medical
[1535.9s] missionary institutions comma not being
[1540.7s] under schools comma not being under the
[1543.9s] conference would you say Amen to that
[1546.2s] that one statement Must Destroy every
[1548.8s] other
[1551.2s] who with intelligence would reason like
[1554.5s] that
[1556.0s] you take one statement that says it's
[1559.3s] not in God's order to separate from the
[1562.3s] conference organization use that to
[1565.2s] destroy every other statement
[1567.7s] that says the opposite and say look when
[1570.9s] you read those are the statements they
[1573.2s] must be understood based on this one
[1576.4s] how could that be
[1578.7s] that's the same argument the Sunday
[1581.1s] people use to justify Sunday
[1585.4s] what year is that written in
[1587.9s] 1901 right September look at the
[1590.4s] statement here
[1591.3s] what year is this at the bottom
[1593.9s] 1907 to whom their sister went right
[1598.8s] Elder Daniels was actually the general
[1601.9s] conference president
[1604.4s] watch this statement when my advice was
[1607.5s] asked in reference
[1609.3s] to the Madison School the watch School
[1612.1s] now when you hear school you're thinking
[1614.3s] uh classroom setting
[1617.2s] theater style uh a lectern and teacher
[1621.9s] the Madison School means an Enterprise
[1625.2s] right setting up training centers and
[1629.6s] raising up schools churches medical
[1633.2s] missionary sites and Publishing houses
[1636.8s] watch this by the way let's go there
[1639.3s] because I put it in your mind listen
[1642.0s] located 10 miles Northeast of Nashville
[1645.3s] Madison was an important spot in early
[1649.8s] Southern Seventh-Day adventism
[1653.7s] the Madison property often referred to
[1656.9s] as a medicine farm so you have
[1658.6s] management School management Farm was
[1661.2s] purchased in what year
[1663.1s] 1904 with the financial assistance of
[1667.3s] Nelly uh Gillard and the prophetic
[1671.1s] vision of Ellen White it says
[1673.9s] spearheaded by EA Sutherland Percy Megan
[1679.1s] the medicine contingent contingent now
[1682.6s] would spawn a collection of what schools
[1686.4s] hospitals Industries and what churches
[1689.9s] around the South
[1691.9s] so what were they establishing
[1695.6s] all right watch careful now let's go
[1699.2s] right here I'll come back to that watch
[1701.8s] us now friends it says when my advice
[1704.7s] was asked in reference to the Madison
[1707.7s] School I said remain as you are there is
[1712.9s] danger in binding every working agency
[1717.7s] everyone
[1719.8s] Elder Buchanan I mean should I go there
[1722.7s] now
[1723.9s] you say no are you my conscience
[1726.2s] preacher listen I agree with you there
[1729.1s] is a danger in binding every working
[1732.0s] agency under the what friends the
[1735.4s] dictation of the conference the Lord did
[1738.6s] not design that this should be
[1742.3s] so friends which statement was inspired
[1744.7s] the 1901 or 1907 which one
[1750.0s] which one was inspired
[1752.5s] which one
[1754.0s] both were inspired
[1756.4s] so why the difference circumstances
[1760.5s] what's the difference
[1762.4s] circumstances now here is a counter
[1765.1s] argument to this statement here on the
[1767.3s] screen
[1768.8s] some would say well that's true that's
[1771.9s] how medicine began
[1774.7s] not with the conference but later on in
[1777.9s] years right later on maybe a decade
[1780.7s] after or so some of the various
[1783.7s] institutions they established came back
[1786.9s] under the conference
[1788.8s] so that means you must negate this
[1791.1s] instruction here
[1792.6s] who is in that way
[1794.7s] because circumstances
[1797.3s] changed does not destroy the council
[1801.8s] that was given
[1804.9s] have ever read in the Bible the Lord
[1807.7s] repented
[1809.8s] have you
[1811.6s] why would God repent
[1814.1s] that would be a good Bible question
[1817.4s] so let me not give too much on that okay
[1819.6s] but why did God repent
[1823.4s] because circumstances changed so he
[1827.8s] promised destruction right and what
[1830.1s] happened it was coming but they were
[1833.6s] they repented so God withheld it God
[1838.1s] repented oh that's the answer right dear
[1839.9s] friends can God sin
[1841.9s] so repent it doesn't mean to sin and
[1843.9s] repent and to convert amen so God
[1846.7s] changed because
[1848.3s] circumstances change he withheld
[1851.2s] destruction one example Nineveh
[1854.7s] minivan amen it's clear
[1858.5s] God withheld destruction let's continue
[1861.0s] it says the Lord did not design that
[1864.4s] this should be what are the next two
[1866.7s] words in blue
[1870.3s] the circumstances were such
[1873.1s] the burden-bearers in the Madison School
[1876.4s] could not bind up their work with the
[1879.6s] conference
[1881.7s] I knew their situation and when many of
[1885.3s] the leading men in our conferences
[1888.3s] ignore them because they did not Place
[1891.8s] their school
[1893.6s] under the
[1895.6s] the conference dictation I was shown
[1898.6s] that they would not be helped by making
[1902.0s] themselves amenable to what the
[1905.5s] conference they had better remain as led
[1909.1s] by God amenable to him to work out his
[1913.3s] plans but this matter need not be blazed
[1919.0s] abroad
[1920.5s] so friends what if the circumstances
[1924.1s] that were Rife and prevalent in this
[1929.1s] time 1907
[1930.9s] when the instruction was given what if
[1933.9s] they are prevalent today
[1937.1s] would it be okay then to follow the same
[1939.6s] instructions
[1942.2s] or do you not believe in inspiration
[1946.2s] is inspiration
[1948.3s] it was given because of circle says
[1952.2s] are they alive in the world today so how
[1955.3s] could you negate the statement and
[1957.3s] because they can they say well later on
[1959.8s] some of those churches were brought
[1962.6s] under the conference
[1964.4s] does that negate the instruction
[1968.0s] sometimes men reason as if they are
[1972.6s] infants
[1974.7s] and it's either they are ignorant listen
[1977.4s] attentively either they are ignorant or
[1980.5s] they lack comprehension skills they lack
[1983.8s] intelligence or they have a Sinister
[1986.8s] agenda
[1988.6s] I wonder what it is which one let's move
[1991.2s] on Modern paragraph
[1993.0s] it says means have been held from them
[1996.3s] Madison because in the organization and
[2000.2s] management of the Madison School it was
[2003.3s] not placed under the control of the
[2006.6s] conference
[2008.8s] but the reason why this school wasn't
[2012.2s] owned and controlled by the conference
[2014.7s] have not been duly considered move on
[2019.1s] then she said watch carefully friends
[2022.4s] how much of this I want to give you
[2025.2s] watch carefully you want all of it some
[2027.2s] with all of it red words Huntsville
[2030.2s] first sentence
[2032.1s] Alabama Madison listen in the matter of
[2036.0s] the Madison School there has been a
[2038.5s] standing off from them because they were
[2041.0s] not under the ownership and control of
[2044.8s] some conference
[2046.4s] all right it says this is a question
[2050.3s] thou should sometimes be considered but
[2054.0s] it is not the Lord's plan
[2056.7s] that means should be withheld from
[2059.9s] medicine because they were what
[2063.0s] I want to ask you a question
[2065.1s] what
[2067.7s] antithesis do we hear to that statement
[2072.9s] every tithe every offering must go weird
[2081.5s] huh so you hear one thing but read
[2084.5s] something else
[2086.6s] Luke 12 verse 1 Beware of the hypocrisy
[2091.1s] of the Pharisees the leaven of the
[2094.3s] leaders hypocrisy that's what it says
[2096.5s] right there that means means can go to
[2099.2s] where institutions not connected to the
[2102.7s] conference
[2104.4s] let's read on
[2105.8s] the attitude with some of our Brethren
[2110.4s] have assumed
[2112.8s] toward this Enterprise shows it is not
[2116.7s] wise for every every working agency to
[2120.8s] be under the dictation of conference
[2123.6s] officers there are Harmony they're all
[2127.1s] is that what sister white wrote they're
[2129.3s] all no there are some
[2132.7s] Enterprises on the one certain
[2135.9s] conditions that will produce better
[2138.6s] results if one standing alone
[2143.0s] that's abc123
[2148.8s] is that clear friends
[2151.5s] now that's why you you would never hear
[2154.4s] yours truly say
[2156.7s] every church is in apostasy or everybody
[2159.8s] come what I'm simply calling people out
[2163.6s] of War apostasy wherever it is
[2166.7s] conference lines or self-supporting
[2169.8s] lines
[2171.1s] now do we have to wait second do we have
[2175.0s] to wait to see apostasy
[2178.2s] and use that as the reason to stand
[2181.1s] alone
[2182.2s] no no no you don't have to give me a
[2186.5s] Biblical example of that
[2188.4s] where somebody didn't work with the
[2191.2s] conference the sanhegan council but yet
[2193.7s] stood alone in Ministry John the Baptist
[2197.4s] who was he by the way before I get to
[2199.7s] Christ who was he by the way John the
[2201.3s] Baptist whose son was he
[2204.4s] Zacharias who was Zacharias
[2207.1s] high priest so in the natural order of
[2210.5s] things
[2211.4s] what and who what office should John the
[2215.6s] Baptist have assumed
[2219.3s] high priest priesthood but what happened
[2221.8s] God didn't call him to become a high
[2224.7s] priest a pastor an elder in the
[2227.9s] Sanhedrin Conference of synagogues he
[2231.5s] had a self-supporting and independent
[2234.0s] Ministry of the conference
[2239.7s] song
[2240.9s] Enterprises can stand alone
[2244.5s] I'm going to say this
[2247.0s] many of these men
[2249.3s] they frame their talking points as if
[2253.3s] there's only one side
[2255.8s] that has an issue
[2257.9s] as if you folks over here who are
[2260.4s] self-supporting you despise the brethren
[2263.9s] in the conference and separate yourself
[2266.6s] you will never hear them look on the
[2268.9s] other angle
[2270.3s] and say those men in the conference
[2272.7s] don't want to hear truth
[2276.9s] hypocrisy
[2279.1s] and they in the conference will never
[2281.8s] invite some men to come and preach in
[2284.1s] their pulpits
[2286.3s] it's always one perspective
[2289.5s] Sinister agenda
[2291.7s] when you can be balanced
[2293.9s] you can be bought and sold you're a
[2297.1s] Slave
[2298.5s] let's move on from that I told you
[2301.4s] you're going to get it
[2303.0s] what year is this at the bottom what
[2305.1s] year
[2306.9s] what year
[2308.9s] do you remember hold on because
[2310.3s] everything I say I must give you
[2312.4s] receipts receipts you remember a man
[2315.6s] whose name is he's alive Bill not
[2319.5s] and he wrote an article says time to
[2323.4s] marginalize
[2325.2s] he says it's time to ostracize men like
[2329.4s] dog Bachelor
[2331.9s] anyone
[2333.4s] who preaches against women's ordination
[2338.2s] should not be brought into SDA pulpits
[2341.6s] what is that
[2343.4s] separation right
[2346.4s] let's come here what year is this on the
[2349.7s] screen friends
[2350.9s] 1903 okay notice now this is Ellen White
[2355.4s] and she's speaking of her son Edson
[2358.5s] white that's the first two sentences
[2361.3s] blue words just a white rights he it's
[2364.9s] in white her son will be accounted out
[2368.3s] of what
[2369.4s] out of line but many
[2373.1s] ought to be out of the lines that have
[2376.2s] been maintained to be the regular
[2378.8s] routine
[2380.5s] how many
[2381.8s] no some few many and unless they
[2386.9s] themselves the conference line come into
[2390.2s] line they will say we are God's Church
[2395.2s] so the conference Brethren will say we
[2398.3s] are God's Temple we are God's Church
[2401.4s] sister white says unless that Temple is
[2404.7s] purified cleansed and Sanctified God
[2407.6s] would not give them his presence in the
[2410.3s] temple of which they boast
[2412.9s] those who would have rejoiced to see
[2415.4s] something done
[2416.7s] were all determined to give one no
[2420.2s] recognition to whom it's in white as a
[2423.6s] person or the one his work
[2426.6s] why because he did not work in the
[2431.8s] break what is a regular lines the
[2434.0s] conference what year is that
[2437.2s] but they caught 1901.
[2440.3s] now which one
[2442.3s] which one came after 1901
[2445.9s] oh friends listen God has presented
[2449.7s] before you how he regarded the regular
[2453.5s] lines it says it needs to be broken as a
[2458.0s] word a partridge vessel is broken
[2461.0s] and what reconstructed how could you say
[2464.3s] 1901 Must Destroy this statement
[2468.1s] put this reference down
[2470.1s] in great controversy
[2474.8s] 371 sister white rights she says
[2479.5s] not one statement should be used not
[2484.4s] once saying of Christ let's fix it
[2486.7s] properly not one thing of Christ should
[2490.6s] be used to destroy another you can't do
[2494.8s] that friends they're all inspired let's
[2497.6s] let's move on
[2499.0s] now look at this statement here what
[2502.2s] year is that at the bottom
[2505.5s] 1907
[2507.0s] where was Sister white in 1907 or even
[2510.3s] before 1907 where was she because I mean
[2513.5s] that was when it was written where was
[2515.0s] she what was she doing she said the
[2518.7s] churches
[2519.8s] that her son established outside of the
[2523.8s] conference she was there to dedicate
[2526.1s] those churches
[2528.1s] 1907.
[2529.8s] now here is a counter argument yeah but
[2532.9s] some of those churches decades after
[2535.8s] were brought back into the conference
[2538.1s] does that negate the statement
[2543.0s] ignorance a lack of mental Acumen Lord
[2547.1s] have mercy let's move on from that and
[2549.8s] there it is
[2551.2s] stay as you are you don't need to unite
[2554.3s] with them
[2555.3s] all right what year is this first line
[2558.5s] blue words
[2560.1s] 1901 who is Sister what writing to
[2564.6s] who was A.G Daniels
[2567.2s] General Conference president and what
[2570.2s] does she write she says pharisaism red
[2573.8s] words Ferry says him in the Christian
[2576.5s] world is what not extinct
[2580.1s] she says in the SDA church we have a
[2583.8s] Pharisees him
[2585.8s] so she's connecting
[2588.4s] the Sanhedrin council with the General
[2592.2s] Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists
[2597.6s] what year is that in 1901 what does she
[2601.1s] say the regular lines may prove a
[2605.0s] failure and a want a sneer
[2608.1s] conference lines for instance 1901.
[2611.2s] 1901 again she says shall the regular
[2616.0s] lines which say every mind shall be what
[2620.2s] what's the word controlled
[2623.5s] not every working agency church should
[2627.8s] be under the control of the conference
[2630.6s] 1903 1907 1901 how many more statements
[2635.6s] you want
[2637.0s] every mind shall be controlled by two or
[2639.7s] three Minds at Battle Creek continue to
[2642.7s] Bear Swift well oh pastor we have 13
[2645.5s] divisions now
[2647.2s] we have more than two or three
[2649.8s] it's not the amount of men is what
[2651.9s] you're teaching
[2653.3s] and what they're supporting and
[2654.8s] promoting that's the problem because if
[2657.2s] you have how many how many men
[2660.0s] ruled Israel in the time of King Saul
[2665.1s] was it not Samuel
[2666.7s] was he faithful to God
[2668.8s] let's move on shall men go
[2671.9s] to the regular lines to see whether they
[2675.6s] will be permitted to labor or shall they
[2678.6s] go out and work as best they can
[2683.0s] depending on their own work
[2686.9s] we don't need their ordination nor their
[2690.2s] approval go to work for God all right
[2693.6s] friend how much more let me see
[2696.2s] something here all right 1901 James
[2700.1s] Edson white she says the Lord has
[2703.4s] blessed my son in the south
[2705.5s] second sentence God grant that the
[2709.0s] voices which have been so quickly raised
[2712.7s] to say that all the money
[2716.0s] invested in the work must go through the
[2720.6s] appointed Channel at Battle Creek shall
[2723.5s] what
[2725.1s] not be heard
[2726.5s] Battle Creek today is what now
[2730.2s] there in Spring
[2731.9s] Michigan or
[2734.4s] the one in in Maryland DC
[2737.6s] Silver Spring Maryland it is their
[2741.1s] privilege to give what direct Aid and
[2744.3s] what assistance to missions that's it
[2747.5s] friends it's clear
[2749.1s] there it is again Edson white past that
[2752.1s] friends write this down that reference
[2754.8s] please very very important
[2757.2s] it says it is as hard today
[2761.1s] to break away from what what
[2764.6s] did you all hear that everybody read
[2768.3s] words what it says it is as hard today
[2773.5s] to break away from the regular lines as
[2779.0s] it was in whose day in Christ's day
[2782.5s] what does Breakaway mean
[2786.5s] huh what does Breakaway mean
[2792.2s] listen we have had great light let us
[2796.4s] not become narrow let us break the bonds
[2800.7s] which bind us
[2803.5s] hard to break away from what
[2806.3s] the regular lines
[2810.6s] now is Sister white saying Everybody
[2812.6s] Must Break Free at the conference
[2815.1s] but where their circumstances you can
[2817.8s] stand how separate alone with Christ
[2821.4s] with Christ with Christ okay go to John
[2825.5s] 15.
[2827.0s] do you know what is startling among
[2828.8s] these men
[2830.3s] they give you several quotes and hardly
[2834.0s] no Bible
[2836.2s] no Bible
[2837.5s] and that's why their statements and
[2840.7s] arguments are convoluted
[2844.5s] as we would say Tom foodery
[2846.7s] where are we going to John what chapter
[2848.5s] go to John 15. what does verse 1 say in
[2852.0s] John 15 friends what does Christ saying
[2855.5s] I am the what the true vine listen to
[2859.8s] what sister white says Bible Spirit of
[2861.9s] Prophecy this is the Desire of Ages
[2866.1s] she writes I am the True Vine listen the
[2870.0s] Jews had always regarded
[2873.4s] the vine as the most noble of plants
[2877.8s] and a type of all that was powerful
[2881.5s] excellent and fruitful
[2884.6s] Israel had been what
[2887.0s] represented as a what Vine
[2890.3s] which God had planted red words the Jews
[2895.2s] based the hope of Salvation on the fact
[2899.1s] of what friends their connection with
[2902.0s] Israel
[2904.9s] can Church connection save anybody
[2909.0s] what saves What Not Who what saves truth
[2913.1s] who saves
[2914.6s] who is he the way the truth the life
[2918.6s] listen what Christ now says I am the
[2922.7s] real Vine think not that through a
[2927.0s] connection with the church you may
[2929.8s] become partakers of the life of God and
[2934.2s] inheritors of his promise
[2937.1s] so me alone a spiritual life received
[2941.9s] that Bible and spirit of Prophecy
[2946.0s] how then could you believe that sister
[2948.8s] white is going to write anything
[2950.6s] different
[2953.2s] John 15 let's move on
[2956.1s] sister white rights the Pharisees
[2958.9s] declared themselves the children of
[2962.1s] Abraham
[2964.5s] Christ told them that this claim could
[2967.9s] be established only by doing what the
[2971.5s] works of Abraham
[2974.1s] blue words a mere lineal descent from
[2978.8s] Abraham was of no value without a
[2983.1s] spiritual connection with Christ your
[2986.1s] connection means nothing
[2989.8s] and that's what they're preaching stay
[2992.1s] in the church they're preaching
[2994.2s] salvation through the church
[2996.6s] and people are eating and drinking that
[2999.6s] Hook Line and Sinker deceive they
[3002.5s] haven't read nor prayed over this for
[3005.3s] themselves
[3006.7s] one more statement all the Desire of
[3009.2s] Ages
[3010.3s] all right it says descent do I want this
[3014.1s] one
[3015.7s] you could take note of the reference
[3018.1s] I'll move on from this one okay
[3020.9s] argue for this one page 107 paragraph
[3024.0s] one John the Baptist said the ax is laid
[3028.3s] weird at the root
[3030.5s] red words not by its name but by its
[3035.3s] fruit is the value of a tree determined
[3040.1s] if the fruit is worthless
[3044.2s] the name cannot save the tree from
[3048.6s] oh
[3050.6s] would the name save you was Seventh-Day
[3054.1s] Adventists save you I cannot save you
[3056.8s] what must we have what must we reveal
[3059.9s] what must we manifest the fruit last
[3063.7s] sentence profession was profession is
[3068.8s] worthless
[3071.2s] if our lives and characters are not in
[3075.2s] harmony with God's law we are not his
[3079.2s] people
[3083.3s] and Christ made this statement John 15
[3086.7s] before he was crucified
[3090.1s] and Christ's crucifixion typifies the
[3093.1s] sunderl
[3095.5s] it's relevant right now and applicable
[3097.6s] let me see how much more of this I can
[3099.6s] give you than I'll close
[3102.6s] go to Matthew 15.
[3105.1s] where are we going to friends
[3107.6s] Matthew 15.
[3109.4s] let's take this Matthew 15 look at verse
[3113.1s] 7.
[3114.7s] what did Christ preacher give me 10.
[3118.7s] what did Christ preach in verse 7 and
[3121.7s] call the leaders
[3123.7s] Hypocrites right Hypocrites skip one
[3126.9s] down with me to verse number nine what
[3129.5s] were they teaching
[3132.9s] men's doctrines
[3135.4s] all right for God's Commandments and
[3138.8s] they were worshiping God in vain skip on
[3141.1s] down to verse number verse number 12.
[3145.3s] the disciples came to Christ Lord you
[3148.9s] offended
[3150.6s] the leaders of the church
[3153.7s] Christ the Christ apologize
[3157.3s] he said nothing wrong he spoke present
[3160.3s] truth no need for apology look at verse
[3163.7s] number 14. what did Christ say now verse
[3166.0s] 13 every plan
[3168.0s] my father
[3169.5s] had not planted shall be won rooted up
[3172.6s] let them alone what
[3176.0s] look at the statement
[3177.7s] the disciples had been much disappointed
[3182.0s] that Jesus had not tried to secure what
[3186.6s] everybody
[3189.2s] the cooperation of the leaders in Israel
[3194.0s] they felt it was a mistake for Jesus not
[3199.1s] to strengthen his cause by securing the
[3203.2s] support
[3204.3s] of these influential men
[3207.9s] past Enriquez why do you not work with
[3211.6s] the conference leaders
[3214.6s] ask them the same question
[3216.8s] and reverse it and see what they tell
[3219.4s] you
[3220.4s] that's them
[3223.4s] watch it says the corporation of such
[3228.4s] men
[3229.7s] listen as the disciples were anxious to
[3234.2s] secure would have betrayed the work of
[3238.0s] God into the hands of its home birth
[3242.0s] enemies
[3244.7s] is that clear friends
[3249.0s] some people will see this and still say
[3251.5s] I don't see it do you know why
[3255.8s] they're blind
[3257.6s] they're blind
[3259.0s] they're blind
[3260.8s] they're blind
[3262.3s] let's go to Lou chapter nine
[3265.4s] Bible Spirit of Prophecy where we're
[3267.3s] going to France
[3269.0s] Luke Chapter now look what this says in
[3271.1s] Luke chapter 9. let them alone by the
[3275.3s] way by the way hold your place in Luke 9
[3277.6s] go to Acts 2 leave them alone
[3280.9s] acts what chapter now
[3282.9s] Acts chapter 2. this is on the day of
[3286.9s] Pentecost right
[3289.1s] probation had not yet been closed on the
[3292.7s] Jewish Church look at Acts chapter 2
[3295.1s] verse 40.
[3297.9s] the disciples said to the people
[3301.3s] save yourselves from this world unto
[3304.9s] Ward Generations what's untoward mean
[3308.2s] corrupt
[3309.5s] meaning leave them alone verse 41 they
[3313.7s] were baptized
[3315.3s] verse 42 the people after being baptized
[3320.0s] did they go back
[3323.6s] to those apostate leaders yes or no did
[3326.7s] they my friends no they fellowshipped
[3329.8s] with whom
[3331.1s] those who had truth
[3333.6s] those of Our Truth Bible do you remember
[3336.8s] in John chapter 6
[3340.6s] when the majority of Christ disciples
[3343.5s] left him
[3345.9s] and Christ turned to the twelve and said
[3349.0s] to them will you also go
[3351.7s] what did Peter say
[3354.0s] to whom shall we go
[3356.2s] you have what the words of eternal life
[3359.8s] so what were they following
[3362.3s] truth
[3363.7s] truth truth but those men went right
[3366.7s] back to the conference of that day
[3370.7s] before I take Luke 9 have you ever heard
[3373.6s] people say
[3374.7s] to rebut this sister white died in the
[3378.1s] church
[3378.9s] I wonder which church you got in
[3382.5s] sister white preach in the Adventist
[3384.8s] churches SDA churches
[3387.2s] she had credentials in the SDA churches
[3391.3s] so that must be used to negate her
[3395.0s] statements
[3396.4s] do you see the fallacy in the reasoning
[3400.1s] so because she died a Seventh-Day
[3402.8s] Adventist
[3404.4s] that must you be used to negate that she
[3407.4s] says on the several circumstances
[3411.9s] it's okay for churches Enterprises to
[3416.2s] stand separate
[3417.8s] from the conference control
[3421.6s] who would reason that way
[3424.4s] want to ask a question
[3425.9s] did Christ preach in the synagogues
[3429.2s] did he yes he did did sister white
[3432.1s] preach in the SDA churches yes she did
[3436.0s] did Jesus also simultaneously set up a
[3440.6s] Ministry Church training school
[3443.5s] baptizing people not with the Sanhedrin
[3446.9s] yeah did sister white simultaneously
[3450.1s] support Ministries churches schools not
[3454.7s] with the conference yeah
[3461.0s] so where's the problem
[3463.2s] it's in your minds
[3464.9s] that's where it is you have a Sinister
[3467.2s] agenda
[3468.8s] it's clear for those who want to see it
[3472.6s] is the Bible true
[3474.3s] go to Luke 9. Luke 9 you have to use
[3477.9s] Bible and spread of Prophecy
[3480.4s] and some people still won't believe this
[3482.5s] I am simply making sure it's on the
[3485.8s] record let me hear some my footsteps
[3487.8s] Luke chapter 9 in verse 49 and John
[3492.2s] answered
[3494.0s] Master we saw one doing what casting out
[3498.3s] devils in thy name
[3500.4s] what happened we forbade him why
[3505.0s] because he did not follow us he was not
[3509.0s] with our ministry
[3512.9s] do you realize that these were disciples
[3516.2s] not with the conference
[3518.6s] and yet they were telling Christ please
[3520.9s] support seek the approval of the
[3524.8s] Sanhedrin many of you who are sitting
[3527.3s] here might have the same sentiment
[3530.5s] Pastor henriquez I come to save to serve
[3533.8s] but please work with the conference
[3535.7s] please
[3537.5s] the same thing with Christ 12 disciples
[3542.2s] nothing new Under the Sun
[3545.1s] nothing new here they are now in Luke 9.
[3548.9s] they are saying Master this man is not
[3552.5s] under our ministry and control so he
[3556.5s] should not be preaching
[3558.2s] let's do everything on social media to
[3562.0s] shut him down
[3563.6s] let's misconstrue statements publish
[3567.1s] them to deceive the people to stop
[3569.8s] listening and following him
[3572.1s] same situation here
[3574.1s] go to verse 15. what did Christ say now
[3576.8s] you have done well no
[3579.3s] forbid him not why
[3584.4s] listen what sister white says here
[3586.1s] friend she says watch carefully come on
[3588.9s] where is it
[3593.0s] all right
[3594.8s] she says Master we saw one casting out
[3598.8s] devils in thy name
[3600.5s] and that man didn't follow us listen now
[3603.7s] James and John had taught James and John
[3608.1s] had thought that in checking this man
[3611.8s] they had had in view their Lord's honor
[3615.7s] and listen to me these preachers on
[3618.8s] social media in the SDA Church they
[3621.6s] called themselves champions of the faith
[3624.5s] we are champions for the conference
[3627.4s] do you know who they are
[3629.0s] they are modern day Dr EK
[3632.2s] again
[3633.8s] who was Dr EK against
[3637.2s] have you read the book great controversy
[3640.0s] who was Dr Eck again
[3642.4s] Martin Luther the Protestant reformer
[3646.0s] they are the modern day Dr Eric
[3649.6s] okay listen James and John had thought
[3653.0s] that in checking this man they had had
[3656.0s] in viewed their Lord's honor they began
[3658.7s] to see that their reward
[3661.4s] they were what so what was at the root
[3664.3s] of all those polls and videos jealousy
[3670.2s] jealousy
[3671.6s] but afterwards they acknowledge their
[3674.2s] error and accepted Christ's reproof
[3678.0s] listen none who showed themselves in any
[3681.4s] way friendly to Christ if they are
[3684.2s] preaching present truth leave them
[3687.8s] alone
[3690.1s] listen now when Jesus was no longer
[3693.6s] personally among them
[3695.7s] and the work was left in their hands
[3698.8s] they must not indulge award narrow
[3703.3s] exclusive spirit
[3705.5s] but manifest the same Farm reaching
[3709.2s] sympathy which they had seen in whom in
[3712.6s] their master
[3714.4s] I digress on that point
[3716.9s] beloved do you realize question for you
[3721.0s] which of these two men began their
[3723.7s] Ministry first
[3725.9s] Jesus or John the Baptist
[3729.2s] who
[3730.7s] John the Baptist was John's Ministry
[3733.3s] with the conference of that day no what
[3735.4s] about Christ no all right when Christ
[3738.4s] came on the scene did he say John you
[3740.6s] have to close up shop
[3742.1s] you gotta you got to stop Ministry and
[3744.3s] join me
[3745.9s] that happen
[3747.2s] what happened
[3748.7s] both were working
[3750.9s] even John disciples didn't say we would
[3754.4s] stop preaching and John cries no they
[3757.1s] had separate Ministries
[3759.8s] that's Bible brothers and sisters Bible
[3763.6s] Bible
[3765.2s] this idea of everyone coming under one
[3768.1s] head is potpourri
[3769.9s] that's what it is let's close let's
[3771.7s] close let's close let's close go to
[3774.2s] numbers 11. where are we going to

[3868.3s] grown up to the first stature of men and
[3871.9s] women in Christ they simply live the
[3875.2s] name of Christian but they are not
[3877.8s] fitted for the work of God

[3888.1s] religion of Christ Jesus red words there

[4008.0s] not God's will okay let me close right
[4009.9s] here
[4010.7s] beloved
[4012.0s] I've heard people say
[4014.5s] only conference churches are going to
[4017.8s] finish the work
[4019.7s] only people in the conference listen
[4022.4s] watch
[4026.2s] only people in the conference are going
[4028.6s] to finish the work
[4030.5s] who believes that raise a hand
[4032.6s] not one hand come on who believes that
[4035.0s] only people in the SD a conference will
[4038.6s] finish the work
[4040.9s] anything that will transpire in the last
[4043.8s] days we should find it in the Bible
[4046.8s] First Advent or before that
[4049.3s] at the first Advent
[4051.9s] which men first receive the early reign
[4059.1s] oh so I'm speaking to myself so Andrew
[4061.6s] which man first received the early Reign
[4064.5s] at the first Advent Pentecost the
[4067.8s] Sanhedrin people or the ones with Christ
[4072.8s] which one
[4074.2s] which the latter group the 120
[4078.3s] to 120.
[4082.5s] worthy in the upper room
[4086.0s] where were the others
[4087.8s] in the dark and synagogues 120. 120.
[4092.2s] they received the Holy Spirit first
[4095.5s] I wonder why what were they following
[4099.3s] truth
[4100.8s] what were the other folks following
[4103.7s] man-made tradition do you see his
[4106.2s] friends
[4107.1s] hold on but were there some good folks
[4109.2s] over there
[4110.5s] you remember Nicodemus
[4114.1s] Pastor you said you were closing
[4117.6s] huh you said you were a closing pastor
[4120.6s] neither Joseph nor Nicodemus had openly
[4125.3s] accepted Christ while he was living
[4129.9s] they knew that such a step
[4133.7s] would exclude them from the conference
[4137.4s] Sanhedrin and they hope to protect
[4140.4s] Christ by the influence in its councils
[4144.0s] what does that mean we can stay in the
[4146.9s] conference and still preach president
[4148.5s] truth
[4150.9s] for a Time they had seemed to succeed
[4155.8s] listen
[4157.3s] but the Wily priests
[4159.9s] seeing their favor to Christ had
[4162.7s] thwarted their plans
[4164.6s] in their absence Christ had been what
[4167.9s] condemned delivered to be crucified now
[4171.8s] that Christ was dead
[4173.9s] they no longer Nicodemus no longer what
[4178.8s] concealed their attachment to him here's
[4181.6s] my point there's some pastors right now
[4185.5s] in the SDA conference
[4187.9s] who are timid
[4190.0s] and a fruit to stand for all the truth
[4193.2s] they will stand later on a few a few
[4196.8s] will stand later on we are biblical
[4199.2s] example for that I feel that's why you
[4201.6s] would never hear me say all our in
[4203.5s] apostasy
[4204.7s] there are few who will have to come out
[4207.3s] when Nicodemus and Joseph came out
[4211.3s] they had to separate themselves from
[4213.4s] what the apostate leadership they had to
[4215.8s] the leadership they had to
[4217.8s] some will come out but those who think
[4220.3s] now we can stay right here a day is
[4223.6s] going to come you'll have to make a
[4225.9s] decision
[4227.5s] make what a decision
[4230.7s] that's New Testament what about Obadiah
[4235.8s] in the time of whom Elijah
[4239.1s] Obadiah go tell Ahab Elijah is here what
[4243.3s] if I go and preach the Elijah's message
[4248.5s] to Ahab Ahab will chop off my head
[4253.6s] and that's why many conference pastors
[4256.4s] like Obadiah will not preach the
[4259.8s] Elijah's message calling even their own
[4263.3s] superiors to repentance they won't do it
[4267.0s] why paycheck why retirement why uh what
[4272.6s] else accolades why they don't want to be
[4275.7s] diffract why ordination why all of it
[4279.3s] afraid they're selling out cries for 30
[4283.0s] pieces of silver
[4287.1s] 120
[4288.7s] I'm closing now
[4291.4s] 120 received
[4294.6s] the Holy Spirit first and then they went
[4298.3s] out and began to preach
[4300.4s] the majority of the Jews had the last
[4303.7s] opportunity the majority rejected
[4307.0s] some came in accept the truth among
[4310.1s] those who came in the Bible says there
[4312.9s] were priests who came in
[4315.3s] they were priests let's be faithful to
[4317.2s] the Bible we don't have to skew the
[4319.9s] Bible to suit our sinful agenda preach
[4323.7s] the word
[4324.9s] some of them will come out of error and
[4328.3s] stand on the platform of Truth
[4331.0s] okay what have we learned today
[4335.0s] were things clearer
[4337.7s] were things made plain
[4340.0s] where things may play So if you think
[4341.9s] only force in the conference will finish
[4345.2s] this work
[4346.3s] you are ignorant of the Bible
[4349.5s] The Men Who first received the early
[4351.8s] Reign were men not with the conference
[4355.1s] how will it be in the last days
[4357.1s] who first will get the lettering
[4361.3s] oh pastor
[4362.9s] guys I can't see that
[4365.4s] only those who are living and following
[4368.8s] present truth wherever they are they
[4372.3s] will be the ones and if they're faithful
[4373.9s] they're not going to be supported by
[4377.5s] those men and we pray for them
[4380.8s] do you think Christ prayed for Caiaphas
[4383.1s] of course he did
[4385.7s] of course but was he praying for himself
[4388.0s] no he was not and that's where I close
[4390.3s] we have to pray for ourselves study for
[4392.8s] What study for ourselves
[4395.1s] we cannot just say follow truth we must
[4398.1s] know truth so we can follow through
[4400.9s] study for yourselves let's pray
[4409.5s] Father in heaven
[4413.1s] thank you for these words this evening
[4416.4s] may we take heed
[4418.6s] to what we have heard may we be found
[4421.1s] faithful
[4422.6s] firmly standing upon the Bible and
[4425.6s] spirit of Prophecy
[4427.1s] what you have joined together may we not
[4430.2s] put asunder or separate in order
[4433.7s] to accommodate our jealousies Envy
[4437.8s] towards others and our Sinister
[4441.1s] ulterior motives
[4443.3s] may we Heavenly Father
[4446.5s] be found as living examples of your
[4449.2s] truth may we not keep the angels
[4453.1s] on the outside
[4454.6s] in books on buildings on papers
[4458.9s] but may we allow them to come into our
[4461.5s] hearts convict convert and may we now go
[4465.2s] and share with others may we not eat the
[4468.6s] leaven
[4469.6s] of the apostates may we shun it and call
[4473.1s] people to truth
[4474.9s] may this place be a lighthouse
[4477.6s] locally and internationally
[4481.2s] now Lord we pray as we meet this new
[4484.1s] week

[4505.5s] your character more

[4511.7s] may we remember to claim your promises
